YamSuitable9250,1691562256,,,371,15m6z19,1509,AskHR,"""Hi! I never wanted to have to ask something like this, but here I am.\n\nI (F17) have started a new job around a week ago at a large retailer. I am a cashier. Everything was going great, and I have loved my job until now. I have a coworker (M late 30s) who I will call John. \nJohn is also a cashier, and often asks if I\u2019ll be working the same shifts as him. When I confirm I am, he gets very excited. I just assumed it was so he wouldn\u2019t have to take on as much of a workload if there was one more cashier. I get that, so I didn\u2019t pay any mind to it. We didn\u2019t talk to often and he simply offered to help me when needed. \n\nOn Friday, I worked until 10 PM. John was also working until 10 PM. My father came in and stood by my register until I got off my shift for around 15 minutes. John did not even talk to me that night, which was normal. \n\n2 days later, on Sunday, I am working the same hours, and so is John. As the day nears it\u2019s end more of the cashiers end up going home. Me and John are working on adjacent registers, with the other cashier left working on the other end of the store. As the clock nears 10PM, John keeps talking to me more and more, more than I have ever experienced, to the point where he is ignoring customers at his register. I find this a little strange but maybe he is just bored after 7 hours at a cash register. At some point a customer in my lane brings a case of alcohol to me to check out which I cannot sell as I am 17. I ask John to please ring up the beer for the customer separately and he does so. A few minutes after the sale he comes over to me and compliments me on getting him to ring up the alcohol. I just reply with how I didn\u2019t think I could legally sell it and I would rather be safe than sorry. 3-4 times over the shift he comes over and says the same thing, but each time he adds more on how \u201cscared\u201d I sounded. He then kept pressuring me to take his number, and gave it to me on a piece of paper. He told me I had to text him when we were in the store (which is mostly empty at 10 p.m.) so I could have his number. I don\u2019t bring my phone to my register so thankfully he couldn\u2019t have made me do it there. He told me I should text him if I needed help because I was new. This was very alarming to me because my friend who started the same position a day earlier than I did was never spoken to once by John. My friend presents as male and goes by a male name. I present as female and go by a female name. He told me multiple times that I needed to stick around and text him when we were both in the store to make sure I got his number. I did say I needed an answer to one thing,  which was how to take time off. I asked \u201cHow do I take time off? Do I just write my name within the dates and reason for leave in the binder by the time clock?\u201d This was a yes or no question. After this, he told me I had to follow him into the breakroom alone after 10 p.m. He kept insisting that we had to go alone. \n\nAfter this he said \u201cI know you think I am a huge creep right now. I know in your brain you\u2019re thinking \u2018This guy is such a creep get away from me!\u201d. I did think this but I didn\u2019t comment on it. The fact he acknowledged the possibility of me finding him creepy was disturbing. He then said another thing which was very disturbing. He said \u201cBut please come to the breakroom with me after work alone\u2026 I know it sounds naughty because you\u2019re 17 and I\u2019m (late 30s)\u2026 but please do it.\u201d ok i need to break my professional writing here because WTF???? \n\n\nHe closed down his register a bit before ten and waited for me. I counted down the seconds trying to make them last. He showed me the time off request binder, and confirmed everything I said. It could have been answered with a yes. The time off request sheets and binder are not in the breakroom though. I still needed to get my bag from the breakroom, so I went in there anyway and he followed. I tried as hard as I could to not acknowledge him by making eye contact or speaking. I got my bag very quickly and rushed out. He asked me about the phone number again, and I said my mom was waiting for me outside and I didn\u2019t want her to be upset if I was late(Thank god she really was waiting outside for me.)

I am a 55 year old executive and among the 3 oldest people in the company. Yesterday, I was let go after 4 years as a high performing C-level executive in a private company with 185 employees. This termination came with no warning. No write up, no PIP. During the convo, the CEO did not give me a reason for my termination other than saying it is time to part ways. He said several times \u2018I owe you a lot of gratitude for all you\u2019ve done for the company and taught me.\u201d\n\nI was not given a reason for being let go and was asked to leave the same day. I was offered 1 month of severance and told I don\u2019t deserve, nor am I entitled, to any more than that. I asked for 6 month\u2019s severance+insurance which I feel is reasonable for my level, all I\u2019ve contributed to the company and that the termination is not for cause. \n\nI have always reviewed as a high performer at the company. I literally transformed the company from a shit show to a high performance organization of 185 ppl. This is not just my POV but every department manager has acknowledged it. I was not given any verbal or written warning. In fact 3 weeks ago I was assured by the CEO that \u201cI would never fire you\u201d. \n\nI am not interested in getting me job back but asked for 6 month\u2019s severance+insurance which I feel is fair given my contributions to the company, my seniority, and contributions. They are sticking firm with 1 month severances and no insurance. \n\nI\u2019m curious what recourse I might have. I am only looking to protect myself and family financially until I can find a new job. \n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your feedback and advice. The consensus is that I have no recourse. And if there is anything I can/should do (beyond filing for unemployment) it requires having a consult with a lawyer. I truly appreciate your feedback. Thanks.\n\nEdit 2: First of all I truly appreciate everyone\u2019s comments. My hope is to negotiate a reasonable severance without getting lawyers involved. That is a nuclear option which I\u2019m not eager to use. \n\nI have not signed any paperwork the company presented me at me termination and don\u2019t plan to unless we reach a reasonable settlement. \n\nAll of your replies have given good ideas of various options to move forward. You laid out a lot of pros and cons for me to consider as I try to negotiate a reasonable settlement. The comments about lawyers (both pro and cons) give me info on if I have any leverage if I chose that route in the end. Again, I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that. But your your help I am now much more informed. THANK YOU!\n\nFINAL UPDATE: I successfully negotiated the company to give me 3 months of severance and cover my insurance for that time. I\u2019m satisfied and glad that I didn\u2019t have take it any further. I did speak to my cousin who is a litigating lawyer and he offered to help if negotiations failed, but I\u2019m happy with the outcome.

My coworkers have also caught her staring and it makes them uncomfortable too. I have soft high-waisted maternity pants on most of the time as I am 6 months postpartum and having a hard time getting rid of the extra weight and nothing fits.\n\nOne of my other coworkers has been written up after she stared at her for wearing leggings. There is no dress code that says she's not allowed and my coworker always wore them very professionally, she has bad arthritis that makes jeans and other materials hard for her. Mine are legging hybrids for pregnancy and are thick material with flared cuffs. I also have 1 pair of pants that I can wear that are wrangler with no back pockets. I wear them on casual Fridays. \n\nWhen my coworker was written up she said some pretty rude stuff to her about how unflattering they were. HR and Title IX told her that it was up to the director to make the call and didn't want to touch it. I am now afraid that she's going to come after me for wearing maternity clothes. I don't have money to buy other clothes and even if she doesn't write me up, I get the most awful feeling when she is staring at me. It's so intense and directly at my butt. \n\nThis boss also told me that I should stop pumping or lessen my pumping time cause it looks like I don't actually make that much milk and my clients are suffering from not being able to book appointments for 2 hours out of the day (I pump 4 times for 30 minutes). I had to get a breastfeeding advocate to come in and force HR hand to get her to back off. \n\nEdit/update: I want to thank everyone for the advice. I went to HR and they told me that it was a communication issue on my side (I didn't let the director know that I was uncomfortable).

HR was present in the office space at the time so that\u2019s where I went. I did not bring my parents as they were both working. I plan on bringing my dad or my uncle if I do not feel safe after they have reviewed my report. When I brought up the behavior to her, she said \u201cJohn is a bit mentally challenged, so maybe he doesn\u2019t understand how he\u2019s acting.\u201d This is what I thought was happening during the incident until he said \""I know you think I am a huge creep\nright now.

She complimented me on coming to her about this and told me it was definitely not okay. She told me how that was wildly inappropriate of him and that I did the right thing by coming to her immediately. \n\nShe asked me to write a statement on Microsoft word and I used my texts and the post to get every detail I could. It ended up being 1000 words long. She printed it out and made me sign it. She deleted the file on the computer so it would not be found by any other coworkers to prevent gossip. She complimented and thanked me again for coming to her and said my report was very good with the amount of detail and dates and times featured. She told me John was only working this Friday evening, which I am also working. I should have brought up not working that day to her but I was emotional after writing it out.\n\nLater on that day, I found my manager on the floor and told him I do not want to work tomorrow (Friday) because a coworker who was harassing me was also working those hours and I didn\u2019t feel safe. Surprisingly, my manager already knew about it. (I say surprisingly because I was not sure how long it would take and it was very quickly.) He said he knew about it and he would see what he could do about me working tomorrow. He said he would call me tomorrow morning. He then followed up with how he would be bringing in our company\u2019s lawyer (or parent corporation\u2019s, I don\u2019t remember exactly but they were the lawyer for a broad area in our company.) to review my report and continue with the next steps.

I\u2019m going to say the name of the company is Arby\u2019s, but not the specific store.\n\nOn August 24, 2023 I was working 8 am to 3 pm that day, and somebody asked me to stay late 4 pm to 9 pm. I received 2 30 minute breaks for each shift. I was talking with another shift manager who asked if I will be okay and comfortable. I said I\u2019m fine just tired and slow. Assistant Manager (58F) hears this and asked me to follow her into the freezer and made me stand there as she screamed at me saying she disliked lazy annoying employees like me that complain and whine about the job. \n\nShe said she\u2019s a widow living by herself that only makes $15 per hour and that she\u2019s tired too but doesn\u2019t complain. Then states it\u2019s unfair nobody asked her permission for an extra worker ruining her plans and labor. Then also states that corporate has been up her ass and she\u2019s always getting in trouble because of \u201cthe troublesome new hires\u201d\n\nFast forward after the conversation she told me to stay where I was standing and \u201cthink about if I want to work or not\u201d and she will come back to check on me. I\u2019m not sure how long I was in there because she confiscated my cell phone after she left the freezer. The work uniform is a tee shirt plus back pants and apron so it was very cold. \n\nA different manager (20M) found me as he came inside to get a box, and asked what the hell I was doing. I told him it was cold and I felt tired so I sat down and closed my eyes. He told me to not put up with assistant manager\u2019s crap and helped me outside and gave me a jacket and hot drink. I sat at the desk trying to feel better before I went back to work. \n\nApparently she clocked me out the time I was in the freezer so I wasn\u2019t even paid for that. I did as I was told, but Shift Manager (20M) said he ended up arguing with her about her mistreating me and the previous employees who all quit. On August 8 she yelled at a girl (16F) for making the wrong sandwich,  who went to the bathroom to cry and called her mom. The girl quit, but HR has so much evidence on her. \n\n(Side note: There was a big store meeting in May 2022 BEFORE I started working there. I heard from other managers that the higher ups yelled at her and wrote her up for mistreating employees. They stated HR did a big investigation and gave her warning and a mandatory ethics (?) course.\n\nI immediately called HR after the freezer incident, there are cameras and witnesses that day. There has been a week long investigation and meetings. Due to Hurricane Idalia and Labor Day it\u2019s been a little delayed. HR said they reprimanded her and will be giving me a $50 bonus compensation. I am wondering if what happened to me was ethical?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the advice. I have a hopeful feeling that all the previous string of incidents all former complaints filed against Assistant Manager are helping HR and corporate see that what\u2019s she doing is not good. I also have not signed anything or agreed to anything. There have been separate meetings without me, and 2 meetings I have went to at work was one with the General Manager, Assistant Manager, and the District Supervisor and Area Supervisor. The 2nd meeting was with the higher ups, corporate, and HR. \n\nI have taken the guidance of what people have told me to hopefully make a chance at this work place. Including a better work environment. For people asking why I didn\u2019t just leave or why I put up with this, I didn\u2019t know what to really do and I had a lot of exhaustion from working the 1st shift. I also heard a lot of things about her and the incidents where people have made complaints to her because she yells at them or treats them bad. This was my 1st job because many others: Chipotle, Panera Bread, Target, etc didn\u2019t hire me.\n\nAlso Assistant Manager has been working for 23 years now. Although she gets transferred around every few years (not sure if it is complaint related). She has been at this exact store for 3 years now. I\u2019m told that her work ethic has always been like this. I don\u2019t know her too well as she is night shift manager so I only see her if I happen to work night. I do not I am a college student who prefers working mostly 8 am to 3 pm 2-3 days a week. I need money to pay for college and bills. We have had 1 big storewide meeting where everybody (16 workers at that time) had to come and sit down to talk about treating employees with respect.\n\nAdditional Edit: The phone confiscation thing is legitimate and allowed by the company and store. Many other people have their phones confiscated, after I left the freezer and clocked back in she confiscated this other college guy team member\u2019s cell phone and put it in a safe.

ZeMole,1689430770,,,178,150d8y9,924,AskHR,"""Background: For 8 years prior to January of this year I held a position that required a broad (like dozens of pages) NDA and gave me privileged access to any/all data, communications, media, documents, calendars, etc company-wide. I reported directly to the C-Suite and maintained near perfect scores on every review. However, a position within the company came available that, in the short term was a lateral move, but long-term has a much higher income potential. I informed leadership of my interest in that position and they gave it to me on the spot without ever even interviewing for it. This new position is exponentially less stressful but has (over the last few months) resulted in the board and executives being vocal about my success. They keep publicly announcing my milestones in ways that I can\u2019t reasonably ask them to stop doing because there is a respectable amount of revenue attached to my work. This is also resulting in profit margins (exclusive to my department/profit center) that are often 3-5x the rest of the company. \n\n\nMy Problem: The CEO took me out to lunch last week. The conversation was totally normal and positive for the entirety of the meal and included future plans, my vision, how it aligns with his, etc. He used to be my direct supervisor so we have an excellent rapport. After asking for the check he got weird and gave me this preamble about how as CEO he has to deal with all kinds of wild stuff and that recently someone had bypassed HR, gone directly to him, and told him they heard through hearsay that when I held my previous position that I regularly violated the privacy of my coworkers and possibly broke the law with regard to HIPAA violations. He also implied that this someone seemed to believe that I had accessed sexually explicit private media. He told me that a thorough investigation concluded that none of this occurred and I\u2019m 100% in the clear. \n\n\nEverything I did in my previous role came with an audit log and I obsessed over protecting the privacy and integrity of our data. I went out of my way to educate our people about maintaining their own personal data privacy. This isn\u2019t a situation where what they said \u201ccould\u201d be true. It didn\u2019t happen. There\u2019s proof it didn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m not that dude. \n\n\nMy question: **This is eating me alive.** Part of me wants to go to HR and get documentation going because it\u2019s having a direct impact on my perception of my work environment. They hearsay aspect of it tells me that this isn\u2019t just one person. This is also affecting my self-esteem. I pride myself in being the coworker everyone wants on their project teams, and the thought that people have mischaracterized me in such an egregious way is creating this resentment that I can\u2019t even pinpoint who deserves it. \n\n\nThe other part of me says \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have brought it up if HR wasn\u2019t aware and it\u2019s reasonable to assume they\u2019ve all got your back and are squashing this without dragging you into it.\u201d\n\n\nWhat do?""",[SC] Wrongfully accused by coworker of some pretty serious stuff.

Why would someone just not say, please confirm your demographics? \n\n*Edited again to clarify that I am Hispanic, there\u2019s no one definition of Latina I grew up using both idk if I am or not politically correct on that, regardless the database lists them together. My mother is Mexican.\n\n**Clarification - The only reason I tried to pick two/mixed was because if I pick Hispanic I cannot pick a race, if I click white I can\u2019t pick Hispanic. There is no \u201cother\u201d option in the dropdown or \u201cdo not wish to report\u201d option. In the database it shows a required asterisk so I can\u2019t leave it blank. I\u2019ve been here two years always put ethnicity as hispanic/latina and my race white on physical forms when asked, so I\u2019m not sure what the issue is.\n\n**Update - I emailed her back and asked her why she needs me to change that information. Thank you for everyone\u2019s responses! I\u2019ll keep this post updated when I hear back. \n\n***Update - Wow this post blew up. She did not give an answer. She emailed me back asking if I changed it and I answered no, that I am hispanic and the system wouldn\u2019t let me choose white as a race. I ended it with saying if that\u2019s an issue, I would like all reporting on my race/ethnicity be taken off my employee profile. She didn\u2019t respond. Anticlimactic I know.

She is also fast tracking my transfer application and claims I have no disciplinary action. Unfortunately they delete all emails older than 30 days automatically, so I've learned to Bcc my personal now.... So no lawsuit will be coming.

Turns out, that discipline was started in April. (My agreement ended in July) because I kept \""harassing her and demanding extra vacation days.\"" \n\nThe vacation request she was referring to was I needed two weeks FMLA to get a tumor removed. She maintained I didn't need the surgery, I should save my PTO and use that instead. I did argue with her almost daily for about two weeks over getting this surgery approved, and tried getting contact information to set up LOA, etc. She insisted I did not need the surgery, therefore didn't need the contact information, didn't need to do anything. I kept reminding her she's a nurse, not a doctor, especially not mine and can't decide that. \n\nIn April, I had enough, vented to another units supervisor, (C) who gave me the contact info. Coincidentally enough, that DAY I was supposed to be dragged into HR to discuss A's complaints. I emailed first and explained it was a surgery, not a vacation I wanted. I submitted doctors notes and such that A refused to accept. \n\nHR took my side, and gave me the leave, but didn't drop or inform me of the disciplinary actions she had filed. A then started icing me out of everything. Writing me up, making me take blame on situations where I wasn't even there, etc. I only found out about the discipline because I'm actively seeking a different job, away from her. She fought against me getting time off for radiation, and is deliberately under scheduling me/scheduling me on nights she KNOWS I can't work. \n\nShould I go back to HR yet a third time, or just cut my losses? B, the manager I spoke to is covering for A while she's on leave. I know several of my coworkers have waited until A was on leave to take similar complaints to B and she seemed unsurprised by mine. I mentioned that I want out and feel A is blocking me from being hired elsewhere. B originally interviewed me, she knows my resume. She agreed that it seems very suspicious. She offered me a spot on her unit, as have two other managers previously. (I used to float between units.) Every manager I've worked with wants me for their units. Should I take one of them up on it?

For those wondering, I chose not to fabricate anything or feign ignorance, I just told them factually what has been going on. I was asked a few questions I felt were odd and like maybe she had fabricated things, so I pulled up a digital folder I made with all the emails. I sat there awkwardly as they scrolled through with their eyes widened and they just kept looking at each other. This prompted the one HR person to ask if there was any action I wanted to take, and I said no I just want this all to be over with. They said that they appreciate my forthcoming approach and explained that they are there to make everything run as smoothly as possible not only for me but also for her. Finally I was asked not to speak to my coworkers about this issue as it was ongoing and could create problems. That was on Friday. On Monday my coworker asked if I had any updates on the situation and I said I don\u2019t know and didn\u2019t want to get in trouble for discussing it. This coworker works in the department that the serial misnamer is in and I don\u2019t talk to them much so I thought that was a bit fishy. Well I guess they asked her the same question and I was told all about it the next day by them and another employee in the same department. I was approached during my lunch and informed that not only had my coworker told them that HR was completely on her side but that they had overheard her speak to a client on the phone and say \u201cOh she doesn\u2019t work here anymore\u201d. I had nowhere to go and I just wanted to eat my sandwich. But when they told me that last bit I was floored. I sent a follow up email to HR and to my supervisor and I threw in all the terminology that I could. Yesterday HR came in again and my stomach was doing flips all day. I hadn\u2019t received a request to meet with them and I thought for sure I was getting fired for engaging in discussion about the situation after being told not to. I waited and waited but my time never came. I ended up staying late to finish a few things and ended up leaving around the same time as people from her department. No sign of her. Today I came in early to prepare my office for a consultation and 4 people from that department were gathered around the coffee station talking about the lady. I heard one say \u201cI can\u2019t believe she did that\u201d. Out of curiosity I went into my work email and looked at the correspondence list which shows the emails of every single employee and found that she was no longer on the list. Unsure on whether she was fired or she quit. I honestly feel pretty bad about the situation as I never meant for her to lose her job. I just wanted this to be resolved but I guess that wasn\u2019t going to be possible. At the same time I\u2019m a bit relieved to not be dealing with this as it\u2019s been very stressful.

But apparently my boss was already planning on leaving before EOY and in the process of transitioning out, so there wasn't much that could be done besides move the end date up.\n\nSo I guess she just didn't gaf anymore because she knew she was leaving?

This guy, we\u2019ll call him Z (18m), was hired in the beginning of this year. He was very awkward and I would catch him staring at me or other girls in our break room from time to time. I wasn\u2019t scheduled with him for a while after the first few times, and after a couple months of not working with him, I was scheduled with him and noticed that he would casually slide his hands down his pants while other people were in the office. Keep in mind this wasn\u2019t him simply \u201cadjusting\u201d or putting his hands in his pockets. He was very clearly touching himself. I started to keep an eye on him while we were in the break room, and I noticed that he would do it quite frequently, and sometimes put his fingers in his mouth after doing it. I was in the break room with my friend once, and I was across the room while he was sitting across from her and she was talking to me. I noticed her eyes widen and she gestured for me to look at Z, and out of the corner of my eye I saw him staring at me with his hands down his pants. \n\nAround a week later, I was scheduled with him again, and I made my shift supervisor aware of the issue, where I learned that he was also aware of Z\u2019s behavior. My supervisor told me that if I saw him do it again to let him know, and he would have a conversation with him. I\u2019ll let you figure out what happens next, but my supervisor had a conversation with Z that ended in him denying everything and saying that he was just on his phone. I went home and emailed HR that night. I met with HR the following week, where they took mine and another coworker\u2019s statements, getting specific details of Z\u2019s actions and \u201cmovements\u201d when he would touch himself. HR met with Z the following week, and they followed up with me and told me that they were very blunt with him that his actions would not be tolerated in the workplace, and told me to let them know if anything happened again and they would take action. I was very adamant that I did not want to be scheduled with him again, yet I worked with him multiple times after his meeting with HR. \n\nFast forward to around a month ago, Z comes into work just as my shift is ending, and lo and behold, I see him touching himself. I immediately reached out to my boss and HR, who I met with again the following week. This meeting was pretty much the same as the first one, with HR saying they would be addressing the situation immediately. However, my \u201caccommodation\u201d was that if I\u2019m scheduled with him again, I can leave, no questions asked. He works a couple 3-hour shifts a month in the evening, whereas I work upwards of 25-30 hours a week, so in my opinion it\u2019s not that hard for them to not schedule him with me. It\u2019s been a month and I was told they would follow up with me after meeting with Z, and I haven\u2019t heard a peep from my boss or HR.\n\nToday I was made aware by a coworker/friend of mine (16f) that Z was sent home and written up for touching himself. Instead of just an employee write-up, my coworkers who witnessed his behavior were asked by my supervisor to fill out security incident reports as well. The supervisor on duty also reached out to my boss immediately following the incident. I should also add that Z has been written up almost every shift he\u2019s worked for either staring at female coworkers, putting his hands down his pants or overall being terrible at his job. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what my next course of action should be if mine and my coworkers\u2019 complaints are ignored yet again. I\u2019m paid well at this job and I don\u2019t want to be the one to quit because of this, but I am at a loss for what to do. I don\u2019t have any \u201cproof\u201d of Z putting his hands down his pants aside from coworkers texting about his actions in a group chat. My parents have told me that if my workplace continues to ignore our complaints, it\u2019s grounds for a lawsuit. Is this true? I don\u2019t know what else to do.

On Monday of last week I  disclosed that I was 12 weeks pregnant to my employer, and turned in official accommodation and FMLA notification paperwork. When meeting remotely with HR my boss was congratulatory and it didn\u2019t seem like a big deal. I don\u2019t need any accommodations at this time as we work remotely and I am an exempt employee so can leave for doctor\u2019s appointments and come back at any time. He\u2019s never cared what hours everyone works as long as you\u2019re there for meetings and get the work done so it won\u2019t be an issue until further along in my pregnancy. \n\nHowever, all through the rest of the week on meetings he would ask me how I\u2019m feeling or make comments like \u201cwe don\u2019t want to upset her in her condition\u201d when on group meetings. By Thursday the entire team knew something was up and finally one of the other engineers asked what the fuck was going on and my boss said \u201coh she has a bun in the oven, we gotta be careful around her, you know what hormonal women are like.\u201d I was pretty pissed as I work with mostly men and this was not something I wanted divulged until I needed to coordinate coverage while on FMLA. I also really did not appreciate the insinuation that the state of being pregnant made me somehow unstable. Last month I had the highest QA score of anyone in the company, while pregnant. \n\nI asked my boss nicely but firmly to stop with the comments and he got mad. He said he\u2019s \u201cjust trying to make accommodations\u201d per my letter. I explained again that I don\u2019t need any accommodations and that he just needed to treat me exactly the same as always and nothing had changed. \n\nThen Friday I reviewed my pay stub and noticed it was lower than it usually is (payroll has been known to commit errors in the past). I contacted payroll and they said that the reduction had been approved by my boss for \u201ctime not worked.\u201d I emailed my boss and he said that he had deducted my two doctor\u2019s appointments I had had during my first trimester retroactively because I wasn\u2019t \u201chonest\u201d about the reason for the missed time (I was, I told him I\u2019d be afk for a doctor\u2019s appt for a couple of hours just not why). I did contact HR on this and haven\u2019t heard back. I asked around and no one else gets time deducted for appointments, including one guy who goes to therapy every Tuesday at 10:30 (he volunteered  this information himself and everyone knows not to schedule meetings at this time). \n\nThen yesterday at about 11:25  I was on my weekly call with my client and get a meeting invite last minute from my boss for 11:30. I message him and tell him I\u2019ll be late since I\u2019m on my weekly call and he says \u201cok.\u201d Then when I call in he reams into me in front of everyone about how when he calls a meeting he expects everyone to be there, thankfully a couple of the guys stood up for me but it was very odd. After that meeting he calls me and says that if \u201cthis behavior\u201d continues he\u2019s going to put me on a PIP because he \u201cwon\u2019t make any allowances\u201d for me even in my \u201ccondition.\u201d I left the conversation feeling very confused as I am a top performer and he has not had any issues with me prior to last week, when I told him I was pregnant. \n\nTLDR My boss\u2019s behavior has become erratic and retaliatory since disclosing my pregnancy. Is this discrimination?\n\nUpdate: The events in this post inspired as much response in my company\u2019s HR as it did in you guys. Thanks for all of the advice. As soon as my mentor emailed me his accounts of the meeting four other coworkers voluntarily emailed me theirs (these men gossip like hens and word got around quickly). Another former coworker who transferred to another department last year messaged me and said he had a similar situation happen when he challenged our boss about some comment. I saved everything on my personal computer and emailed it to my HR rep. Within about 20 minutes of sending that documentation I got another email from my rep requesting to move up the meeting and adding two other attendees- her Director and VP of HR. They confirmed what you guys said that this is discrimination, I\u2019ll get the withheld payment repaid today. I mentioned how stressful this was and they also offered me the rest of the week off, paid (and not using PTO). I thought that was a little weird- my husband says it\u2019s likely to prevent my boss retaliating against me while they address his issues but I\u2019m a little nervous to take it. Should I?

The HR lady at my work today messaged  and stated she needed to meet with me immediately.. I was obviously concerned so I joined the virtual meeting(my job is 100% remote). She proceeds to tell me that she felt that two months ago I wasn't at home when I was working and was instead at a park playing with my children. Her reason being was because she thought she saw a tree in the background during a meeting we both attended and I once mentioned to her in passing that I liked taking my kids to the park. I was really surprised by this because 1) it happened two months ago and 2) how would I have a setup at the park? I cannot use my work platform on my phone and I have a desktop. She asked me to explain myself and I told her that I wasn't at a park, I was always home working during working hours and that I'm unsure how she thought I could be at a park where there is no internet and yet she saw me In a meeting. She paused and then told me that my children are also very loud during our weekly meetings she also attends and that she personally could always hear them. I again explained that this was not possible because my school aged children are in school during my working hours. She asked me to prove this so I offered to  send In attendance records from the school. She declined and said she believed me then suddenly turned cheery and asked if I had any questions. I asked if my job was in danger and she said no. Said  That she thought I was doing a great job and then ended the meeting. The whole thing was kind of bizarre to me because the park thing doesn't make any sense because, as I stated earlier, she saw me in that meeting . It also seemed odd she insisted she personally could hear my children during meetings when  they are not here while I work and I have proof of that. It seemed like what the meeting was about were more things she herself had experienced months ago and had issues with then Something my coworkers complained about. It was also weird how suddenly cheery she got at the end. a complete shift in mood from accusatory to cherry. It almost seemed like a test to catch me or something but I'm not sure how? Just the way her mood suddenly changed at the end was bizarre. Also why were these concerns not brought up months ago when they occurred.is HR allowed to call a meeting just because of something that saw or does there have to be an employee complaint. Does HR \""test\"" you like that? Can someone make sense of this to me?\n\nUPDATE\nSo I sent her an email offering to provide school attendance and location records for the days in question and reiterated that my kids were in school and largely not here during working hours or meetings .she responded that when she said meetings she actually meant when I was speaking on the phone with my coworkers that my kids were loud and that she personally heard the kids. Which again is impossible because they are not here. I doubled down and informed her there was no way the kids were being heard because they were not here and again offered attendance and location records . I also questioned how she personally heard the kids (as she stated) if I was on a private non recorded call with my coworkers. She declined saying that she didn't need any records  and only met with me because she wanted me to be successful. She didn't answer any questions about how she could hear my phone calls and directed me to drop the conversation.

One is a washing station that this employee said they would need to abide by their daily prayer rituals and explained it involves washing their head and feet so our sinks won't do. The other request is one I really have no idea how to handle, so here I am to learn. This employee asked that we not allow others to eat or cook pork products in our three break rooms and microwave/kitchen areas. The employee stated that due to their beliefs, they cannot consume or be around it, and to use the same facilities would contaminate, basically, their food etc. I'm wondering how to go about this, aside from creating this person their own space, because I am unsure how we dictate what others eat/drink.

Lotus_2016,1692399553,,,1734,15uz73k,3466,careeradvice,"""I was very suddenly laid from my job 2 days ago. Effective immediately. I worked as a data analyst/applications manager/the-only-person-knowledgeable-about-anything-computer-related for a small healthcare group. The company has relied on COVID funding since it's inception, so naturally the funding has dried up and they're downsizing. They (the CEO) took a look at my salary and decided to cut my position, immediately. I had no time to stop what I knew would inevitably happen. Backend processes and automations started crashing, and they will soon be out of compliance with local, state, and federal regulations (they don't realize this yet, and they won't until they get the notice that they're in breach of contract- which could take a few weeks). The contract they're operating under ends in a few months, so I was expecting to be laid off in a few months anyways, but not like this.\n\nI've been getting panicked texts and emails ever since saying they want to bring be back on part-time, at a substantially lower rate than I was making. No one, not even my boss, knows how to maintain a spreadsheet, let alone the other applications I implemented to keep their business running smoothly.\n\nFrom a business perspective, I don't want to take the part-time, less pay offer. It's insulting. From my personal, guilt-ridden perspective, the company provides healthcare to a vulnerable population, and my co-workers, through no fault of their own, will soon lose the ability to care for these patients.\n\nAny advice how to navigate this?\n\nTo note: I don't need the job right now, and was actually relieved to be laid off after working in a COVID-response capacity the past 3 and a half years. Financially, I'll be ok if I don't work for a couple months, so while the paycheck would be nice, I don't *need* it. \\*acknowledging my privilege to be in such a position\\*\n\nTLDR: I was laid off 2  days ago with no notice. Things started falling apart. No one knows how to fix it, so they want me back - for less pay.  \n....\n\nUpdate:  Thank you everyone for your recommendations! I've never been laid off or fired before, I've always left on my own. So while I won't be accepting the offer, I didn't know how to respond. I told them I would take the weekend to consider it (make em sweat a bit). I also discovered that they will not be paying out my unused vacation time. I'm torn between straight up rejecting their offer, or countering with the suggestions of charging $200/hr as a contractor to fix things over the next month or so. However, I get the inkling that they're setting up to just let it all burn down. I'm pretty sure the CEO is just pocketing as much profit as possible before the contracts end. \n\nThis company poached me from the agency that monitors if they're in compliance. I can easily get a job with them again, and probably with their competitor. I'll be applying for unemployment to tie me over. I don't need a job immediately, so I'm not stressed about that aspect.  \n\nUpdate 2: \nI declined their offer,  stating it was not a suitable offer for my skillset and expertise. I did not counter offer. A corporate lawyer friend advised that it could come across as threatening. I have no regrets. I'm slowly applying for new jobs and have had 1 interview already.

The company has protested my claim for unemployment compensation. Do I qualify for unemployment compensation?\nXxxx'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcccxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcccccccc\nMore information:\nThanks Everyone\nYes. I could have given them the opportunity to straitghten it out.  The letter was from payroll. It stated my benefits were canceled and it stated the reason was that my employment terminated. Before leave HR said my leave was approved. I was concerned that someone needed forms so I asked if there were any forms. They sent me short term disability forms. Then, after the surgery, payroll sent forms to my personal email specifying it was my last chance to submit Leave of Absence forms. HR did not give me these firms when I asked before leave. They simply said I was approved. I was on pain medication, should not have been driving and recovering when I drove the forms back to my doctor. We got them in at 3pm on the day of the deadline.  On the day I stopped working, I was confused. I told them I wanted to speak with an attorney and get some advice. I refused to quit and refused to return to work. HR was blaming payroll, who I consider is part of HR. I felt it was the HR directors fault for not giving me the forms when I asked 2weeks before the leave. I did not want to critisize or argue with her. I was confused so I said very little and did nothing. I wanted to get outside advice.  It felt risky to return to a job after being fired without cause. The conversation happened on a Friday before Thankgiving week and I had to decide the Monday of Thanksgiving week. When I can not decide something i feel its better to do nothing from fear of making a decision that makes it worse. When they forced a decision by Monday I still refused to quit, go back and claimed already being fired. They terminated me by a forced voluntary quit that Monday.  In Iowa, employers can terminate for voluntary quit after 3 days no-show, but they did not allow me 3 days of indecision to abandon the job. HR's letter stated that they could understand the stress it caused me and that they could understand not wanting to continue my employment. Then the letter said that if I did not decide to return by Monday it would be a voluntary quit.\nI was also on ADA accommodations for mental illness with this company.  I filed for these accomodations several months before. This cancelation of benefits and firing happened just a couple weeks after I lost Medicaid. I had been on the  COVID relief program and had this job and was still on Medicaid and their benefits. Medicaid had just expired after Teo years of full time working when all this happened. I was in a 90 day window where I could renew my Medicaid benefits instead of applying for Medicaid all over again or trust this company to do things right without future mistakes. I attend two weekly therapy groups, see a therapist and take medication to remain employable and healthy. This is more important than the job, unemployment benefits or wrongful termination. Although these would help while I look for a new job.

I've done lots of research on this, much of it from this sub, and I have some questions.\n\nI live in MO, and according to state labor law, a former employer can disclose reason for leaving among other things to any prospective employer.

Again - my mistake for divulging this much.\n - He agreed to exceed the offer\n - He framed everything in a \""we can use you\"" perspective and not a \""we would like to help you grow your career\"" perspective. Yes - he mentioned how he sees me in leadership **and I believe him based on my experience with the company**, but I also know that the wheel turns slowly and it would be probably 5 years before I see that come to fruition IF AND ONLY IF someone dies/retires. \n - It was clear that even though he took his sweet time coming up with a plan, he didn't have a good plan.\n - It was clear that it was unlikely that any changes would be immediate and no guarantees would be made in terms of minimum time in the new role.\n\nSo tomorrow I'm telling them that I appreciate the generous counter, how I appreciate them coming together to find something for me, but ultimately, I do see a greater opportunity outside of the company, but I would like to get together periodically to talk shop and if an opportunity opens up that can use some of my new skills, I'd love to explore jumping back in (i.e. if they have an opportunity to put me on the Executive Committee or hell - within the team of operating directors, I'd be game).""","UPDATE TO: I have signed and accepted a job offer and put in my notice at my current company.

It is a job working in marketing for a Fortune 500 company. \n\nYesterday evening, my city\u2019s division had dinner meeting. At the meeting, mostly everyone drank and spent time discussing work but also personal lives, sports, etc. Most of attendees had a night booked at a hotel so that anyone who wanted to drink would not worry about driving. \n\nAs the dinner was wrapping up, myself and 2 other young coworkers decided we wanted to go to one more bar before going to bed. As we were arranging this plan, an older coworker (male, around 50) asked if he could join us. We said it was fine and headed to the bar. \n\nAs we were walking in, my ass was slapped two times. I had assumed it was my young female coworker since we are pretty comfortable with each other. We got drinks then the four of us sat down at a table. A few minutes later, the older coworker asked me if I could chat with him at another table, and I said that was fine. \n\nThe first few minutes were ok, but then he suddenly asked, \u201cwould you want to fuck me?\u201d. I said no and got up to go back to the original table. While I did this, my older coworker went to the restroom. I immediately told my two younger coworkers what happened and they said they watched him slap my ass two times on the way into the bar. I was shocked. \n\nAt the same time, my older coworker was walking back to the table so I asked my younger female coworker to go to the restroom with me. For around 10 minutes we discussed the situation and decided the best course of action was just to leave the bar. As we were waiting for our Uber, my older coworker fell completely down out of drunkenness. \n\nMy younger male coworker helped him up,  then we got into an Uber that took us back to my apartment building (which is only one block from the hotel the three of them were staying at). When we got out, my older coworker assumed that we would go into my apartment building and into my apartment together. We all said no, but he was being persistent. \n\nSo for safety, all four of us walked back to the hotel knowing that after my older coworker got to his hotel room, that I would be able to walk back to my apartment safely. \n\nI got home just after midnight and cried for about 30 mins before going to bed. \n\nThis older coworker of mine has been with my company for 15+ years, and I\u2019ve only worked here for 5 months.

We are both engineers - I work at a so-so job that I used to enjoy but no longer do and he works at a large, highly respected company in a role he likes. The situation with my current company is complicated - I was a victim of sexual harassment in which the perpetrator was fired, but things haven\u2019t been the same since that. \n\nI haven\u2019t been actively job searching, but the job market for my industry is hot right now and I talk to a lot of recruiters. One role in particular caught my eye - working with a large company on software that I have a lot of experience with and genuinely enjoy working on. I wanted to see where the opportunity led and I now have a job offer in hand for a higher salary with comparable benefits to my current role.\n\nThe problem is that this role is in another major city in Texas, about a 4 hour drive from where we currently live. My fianc\u00e9 is open to moving as it would be closer to his family, but he can\u2019t leave his job until November due to a contract. He has discussed remote work and transferring offices with his company now that I have the official offer, but didn\u2019t have any luck unfortunately.\n\nHe wants me to be happy, so he wants me to take the job offer and have a job that I really enjoy. But neither of us particularly want to live apart for 6 months.\n\nThe way I see it, we have a couple of options:\n\n1. I refuse the job offer and keep working at my current job. I will keep looking for a job I genuinely enjoy in our current city.\n2. I accept the job offer and live 4 hours away from my fianc\u00e9 for about 6 months. I would come home on weekends and days that I can work from home. He would quit a job he likes after 6 months to move to the new city with me.\n3. I accept the job offer, my fianc\u00e9 quits his job to move and we owe ~$20k to his company for him leaving early (not really an option for us)\n\nWhat would you do in this situation?

I am happy to provide clarifying details as needed.\n\nEdit: seeing lots of \u201coption 2 duh\u201d or something to that effect. We are newly engaged and genuinely love living together, so living apart isn\u2019t sounding super ideal. Yes, I agree 6 months is a drop in the bucket compared to spending our lives together. The question is more how can I ask him to sacrifice his career for mine? It doesn\u2019t seem fair for him to have to leave a job he likes. But I think I will regret passing up this opportunity.\n\nUPDATE: I have accepted the new job and plan to move into a furnished apartment with a 6 month lease until we can find a house together in the new city.

The entire thing is DIY, meaning my fiance, myself, and a handful of others in the bridal party will be orchestrating the whole thing - let's be honest, I'm doing 90% of it as the bride lol. I scheduled the wedding to be on a weekend I have off from work (I work every other weekend consistently) so that I didn't have to book time off for the exact wedding dates. \n\nI work in a longterm care home as a recreation therapist. About a week ago, I put in a request to have the day prior to my wedding off. I typically would work 10am-6pm, but we have so much to do to prep for the wedding the next day (ie, picking up all the tables and chairs, putting up tents, putting up lights and other decorations, making food, etc), as well as we have the rehearsal dinner scheduled for that evening that we have to set up for. Anyways, I was called to my supervisors office after putting in the request and they said realistically it doesn't look like they will be able to give me the day off as it's only myself and 2 others scheduled that day. Typically, 1 recreation therapist covers 2 units, and if I were to not be at work then the other two would have to cover 3 units each. This isn't ideal, however this does happen often as people call in sick on weekends when we are low staffed. My supervisors best offer was that she can allow me to work just a half day, but she can't give me the full day off.\n\nSo my question is, should I insist that I get this 1 requested day off? Or should I just take what I can get and take the half day and suck it up? This supervisor is a stand-in as my real supervisor is off due to an injury - I know my actual supervisor wouldve given me the day off. I do know if I went to the owner of the facility, they would likely tell me to take the day off as well, but I don't want to go over my interim supervisors head necessarily. I'm not a confrontational person so my instinct is to work the half day and deal with the stress, however many people in my life are saying it's ridiculous that they can't give me one day off to prep for my wedding.\n\nTldr; should I insist that I won't be able to work the day prior to my wedding due to wedding prep, or should I simply accept that the request was denied?""","Day off request denied for day before wedding, should I insist I have the day off?",0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/148halw/day_off_request_denied_for_day_before_wedding/,2023-06-13 14:55:28,June,2023

I feel more inclined to respond directly to a message on LinkedIn and it's also a great way to show your interest in the role. A candidate is now moving onto the 3rd and final interview because she did this (based on her resume, she probably wouldn't have received an interview at all).\n* With the above, just remember that hiring managers and recruiters are receiving hundreds, if not thousands, of applications, so this is just advice on increasing your odds in moving to the next round of interviews.""","As a hiring manager in this crazy job market, I recommend you include a cover letter (and some other advice included)",0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/12cke6a/as_a_hiring_manager_in_this_crazy_job_market_i/,2023-04-05 13:28:30,April,2023

I've spent 20+ years in a variety of industries, and have learned the following:\n\n1. No matter how stuck you may feel at your current job, there is ALWAYS a light at the end of the tunnel\n2. Always ask the hard questions in a job interview (how much you expect to make, training period, what is the culture like, why has  this position opened up). Remember, you are interviewing that company just as much as they are interviewing you.\n3. Don't like your job? Instead of complaining, DO something. Work on your resume. Send out 1-2 applications a night. Look at the many free resources online for a new skill. You are the only person responsible for where you're at in life and you have the power to change it\n4. Applying to jobs is time consuming. It is difficult. It can be demotivating. Allow yourself to feel those negative feelings about that process, but keep going! The right opportunity will present itself\n5. Be professional and polite to everyone, even if they're the biggest jerk. Why? You could be standing next to the person who will open some of the biggest doors you'll ever walk through\n6. Learn to recognize the signs of burnout or increased stress within yourself. It may be time to start looking for a new job when you start to dread waking up in the morning, or are having panic attacks\n7. At each job you have, learn to recognize where you excel and where you need to improve. Any employer no matter what industry will highly value someone who can self-evaluate their own capabilities\n8. Learn to say **I do not know how to do that, but I can learn or research it**. Why? No one knows everything and the worst thing you can do is put yourself in boiling water due to overestimating  or lying your abilities or skills\n9. Do not live for your job. Your job is there to support the lifestyle you want to create for yourself; it should not be the center of your universe; it may not be there tomorrow\n10. You work 30 or more hours a week at your job; make sure it is one that you feel proud of""",Tips from someone with 20+ years in various industries,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/l1jen3/tips_from_someone_with_20_years_in_various/,2021-01-20 21:47:15,January,2021

GordonRammstein,1683311656,,,437,138xawd,560,careeradvice,"""I've been loving my current job for the last year and a half. Started as an intern making $30k and quickly moved up to one of the top operators of my facility and am making $87k. I wasnt looking to leave really, but I got an offer for a government run facility doing similar work for $80k. The gov position offers CalPERS healthcare, pension, a 457 retirement plan, better holiday and overtime rates(2.5x hourly instead of 1.8xhourly).\n\nIt's a little bit of a step down pay-wise, but they have a set pay scale that increases regularly, both performance based and COL increases to match inflation rate. I'm also being hired as a \""Grade 1\"", even though I'm Grade 3 certified. To me, that's a perk as I have a lot more potential growth down the road and don't have the same pressure to know how everything works right off the bat if I were hired in a Grade 3 position. Even though it's an initial $7k pay cut, it's a similar pay rate to my current pay, but at the bottom, which means it could/should be even higher once I'm up to speed. They also have an \""employee association\"", which im not too familiar with, but from what I hear it's a very mild headache with the perk of having more job security, whereas the private company can fire you at any time(not that they would).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I gave my notice last week and ever since, my current job has been hitting me with counter offers to sweeten the pot. First offer was $106k for a transfer to another facility, which I turned down due to an awful commute. Latest offer is basically $100k on the dot($48.08 hourly) to stay in my current position with a promotion to grade 3 in the near future, which would bring me into the ballpark of $115k. Current job likes me, wants to keep me, and has big plans for my future. BUT, the benefits are not flexible in any way. They can't offer the same healthcare, they have a standard 401k with a 2% match plus $0.25 for every dollar above that. On the plus side, they're making waves in the industry and are expanding fast into new areas, which could mean better pay and benefits further down the line(just speculating at this point). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltimately, the tradeoff seems to be:\n\na) slightly less money now, but better benefits/retirement and comparable pay in the 6 figure range later down the line\n\n&#x200B;\n\nor\n\n&#x200B;\n\nb) 6 figures now and probably a higher salary cap, but slightly worse in terms of benefits and job security.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm still young and have a long career ahead of me. I'm trying to potentially find a \""forever\"" facility that could take me to an early retirement. The private company offering more money means I could have more personal savings to do with what I please, but the government option means I'm guaranteed a pension for life. Both options have their ups and downs in different areas and it's killing me to make a decision lol. I should also note that since the ball is already rolling on accepting at the new  place, I need to make a final decision quick, and if I do back out and stay where I am, I'll likely burn that bridge(although there are other gov options nearby)""","New job for $80k and government benefits, vs current job counteroffering for $100k, what to do?!",0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/138xawd/new_job_for_80k_and_government_benefits_vs/,2023-05-05 18:34:16,May,2023

It's an administrative role doing the boring, tedious stuff that the subcontract managers don't have time for. Knew it wouldn't be fun, but I figured it would be a solid springboard job to open up more avenues (plus full remote).\n\nSo, I've been here for almost 6 months. Things have gone fine, I got a raise very early on and my immediate colleagues have been pleased given that I came in with no knowledge or experience in *any* of this. Don't particularly like the role or the contract/subcontracts field but I planned to stick around for at least a year.... Until now. \n\nThe Incident:\n\nThe other day, I got an email from the CFO. Immediately, I notice that a TON of people are CCd. Every member of the contracts, subcontracts and accounting department, as well as several other high ranking figures. \n\nI start reading and... Oh god... It's really aggressive. And it's talking about things I'm responsible for. Specifically, it was about delays in the processing of certain invoices and how it's severely hurting cash flow. He goes on and on with words like \""unacceptable\"" and \""ridiculous\"" and how serious discussions need to be had about responsible parties. I get to the bottom...\n\nThere I see an email screenshot with my name circled in red to make it clear that this email was a targeted call-out. I was stunned and I still am. The freaking *CFO* just bypassed at least two links in the chain of command to personally put me, one of the lowest level employees in the company, on blast in front of every person I ever have or ever will interact with. I've never even met/spoken to the guy. There's gotta be some kind of achievement for that.\n\nObviously, this was humiliating and a huge blow to my ego. There was a lot of crying, self-pity and \""Oh God, I'm a failure, I'm an idiot\"" and all that. I'm not gonna act like I'm some top-shelf, above-and-beyond employee, but the delays I was being targeted for were mostly out of my control (I can go into detail about this if anyone cares to know). Basically, tiny bit my fault, but mostly not. \n\nMy manager was absolutely FURIOUS at the CFO.  He immediately jumped to my defense and helped drag my catatonic corpse through the process of proving that my performance was, indeed, satisfactory. \n\nMy manager then proceeded with an absolute baller move; He wrote an email laying out info and evidence in my favor and commending me, making sure to copy EVERY person the CFO had copied. Very grateful for that.\n\nDespite my manager's defense, I feel I have an extremely unwanted spotlight on me now along with irreparable damage to my virtually non-existent reputation. The bridge is sufficiently burned and I don't feel comfortable working somewhere I'm seen as an idiot or a liability. To make matters worse, this experience which should hypothetically light a fire under my ass has left me feeling completely apathetic.

Sunday was my first day, I get to the store, am handed my shirt to put on, and head back to the meat department. The person there was not who I was told would be training me. He tells me that he's left a lot of work for me to do, so I can get used to the process. I tell him that's fine, but that I'd be a little slow getting used to everything.\n\nLess than two hours later and I'm being yelled at because there's still too much work to do, and I'm not moving fast enough. He kicks me out of the department a few minutes later, which has me going to sit in the corner like a child because there's no designated break room that I was informed of. I end up crying a bit, but manage to get it back under control and head back to try and help with the rest of the workload.\n\nI only get yelled at -again- for not properly stacking ground beef in the display, and then again when he assumes I put old product in the back, and misplaced where I had put it... Which was up front, as it should be done.\n\nAt the end of the day, he tries to act apologetic, insisting that he didn't mean to \""be a dick\"", suddenly concerned that I'm acting like I would rather be anywhere else. And frankly, that's the truth. I never want to put that shirt on again, I don't want to set foot near the meat department. The dude knew I was coming in to train, shoveled a workload on my shoulders that I couldn't handle, and then got pissed at me for his mistakes. On top of that, he left early, leaving me to work out how to restock the freezers on my own, and with no guidance, after yelling at me for most of the day for being too slow.\n\nTo clarify a little, he never used abusive language. But the way he spoke to me was very passive-aggressive, and it just left me feeling put off. \""Come on, man, do I really have to show you again?\"", and so on. It got worse towards the end of the day, during cleanup, when he repeatedly 'accidentally' sprayed me down with the cleaning water after ridiculing me for not standing closer.\n\nI'm supposed to go in later this week to work regular store stocking, and then go back to the meat department the day after. But I've been suffering a constant migraine since I started crying on Sunday, and every time I think about having to go back in, it gets worse.

My supervisor just told me staff feel I\u2019m \u201creally hard to work with\u201d. He was unable to provide specific examples but told me each discipline I work with had this blanket view. For context I\u2019m 28(F) and work as a group therapist in inpatient psych. I\u2019ve been in the role now for 10 months. My supervisor only told me that because I said, \u201cI feel like you only ever call me into your office for constructive feedback do you have any positive feedback for me\u201d and their response was \u201cWell, your coworkers find you really hard to work with\u201d.

When I look back on all past jobs I\u2019ve had, I\u2019m obviously the common denominator. I\u2019m quick to think of my feet, am always observing, paying attention, and recognizing patterns of behavior.

Some of you posed some very helpful feedback which gave me time to reflect on the following: my co-therapist does her job to the job description and does it well. With that staff don\u2019t complain about her. I extend myself beyond my role to provide additional support. I believe it comes across as stepping on people\u2019s toes. I need to work on staying in my lane and just defer things to the correct department if the staff is unable to come to a conclusion themself. I have a habit when staff come to me of just making decisions and going with them. That\u2019s not a leader. That\u2019s someone who\u2019s pushy and hard to work with. Additionally, many of you have commented on it\u2019s how I say things I believe that to be true as well. I want to pay close attention to my tone and body language. I would also like to improve on being less direct as that is not a preferred communication style. Also, if anyone has tips on how to fix RBF that\u2019d be great too. Some of you mentioned books to read and I\u2019ll be ordering those! Lastly, about my manager. It\u2019s his managerial style to not provide examples even when asked for them. It\u2019s actually a consistent theme I\u2019ve heard most staff say about their managers where I work. But I\u2019m hoping the supervision allows me to get his thoughts on my barriers to improving so people find me easier to work with.

Additionally, he knew I had talked to his boss already about not feeling like I had a future at the company under his supervision.

Basically I pulled the \""play video games in your parents' basement\"" special until I was 28 years old. I have literally never had a job. I was never schooled as a child, so recently I studied on my own to get my GED. I'm now wanting to find a solid career.\n\n**TL;DR**: I've no money, no resume, and live in the middle of nowhere. I do have free housing and food from my family, so I can live off of smaller jobs, but at the same time, I'm only interested in doing things that I can trust will lead to a good career down the line. What's your recommended path for me to get to a reasonable paying job at some point in the future (it doesn't need to be now, I'm fine working my way up and don't have immediate financial duress)? Please keep in mind, I know practically nothing of \""the outside world\"", I'm basically a child in this regard (sad, I know). I'm seeking advice on what direction I should take my life.\n\nMore specific details:\n\n**My situation**: I still live with my parents. I have $0 in the bank, but my parents will let me stay here as long as I like (I'm very helpful). I'm in a small town in Oregon (removed specific town on suggestion), 600ish people. Nearest town of 15k+ is 45 minutes from here, nearest city of 100k+ (in Washington) is like an hour 20 minutes. Portland is 2 hours. I have no friends, no connections, nothing.\n\n**Me as a person**: I'm physically strong and tall, but have terrible balance (I have a vertigo-like thing where I will randomly nearly fall over from dizziness/light-headedness, ladders/heights are a complete no-go until I resolve this). I'm reasonably intelligent, but I'm bad at memorizing things (especially just being shown or told, if I do something I remember it more effectively). I'm a mild introvert, but not so much that I'm unwilling to do a job that has heavy personal interaction (I just might be bad at it lol). I'm articulate, but I'm not charismatic at all.\n\n**My goals:** My only goal in life is to have a family. Don't even have a girlfriend (don't even know if there are any single women near my age in town lol), so I've got a ways to go. I want to be able to support them and give them a good life. I have no particular desire to make 6 figures or make it big. I just want decent income and a job that's either secure or in demand so I don't have to stress too much about everything falling out from underneath us (I understand, starting this late in life, I may not have this luxury, but it's still my desire).\n\n**My ideas**: I've considered Web Development (self taught from home, following The Odin Project, which I'm already a fair ways into), trying to find a way to go to college to become a Dental Hygienist (the nearest college for me would be 1 hour 40 mins away, and I think there'd be lots of pre reqs which means it might be a 5 year process for me, but honestly I don't know how colleges work and I doubt that career is worth that much money/time), or just getting a job and spamming applications constantly at better places to try to work my way into a good job (e.g. starting at Walmart and trying to get into Costco, both of which are an hour away from me lol).\n\nAnyways, rambling post, sorry. I really, really need help and no one in my family can help me with plans for the future, so I'm hoping one of you can help someone who is completely lost.

I bet most of you can agree this is a very stupid decision. The plan was for my parents to sell our house for around 150,000 USD and then use that money to purchase a high-end RV or trailer and get a truck to move said trailer.\n\nThis definitely wouldn't be enough money at all and I told them this, but they continued to deny this. I also had all A's at my public school, and I was continuing to join around 3 or 4 clubs and gather more promising electives like Speech and Debate and Weight Training to put those on a college resume and either get a job for music, photography, or film. I was starting to plan out my life more and more, but because of this decision to move with an RV everything was falling apart for me, I didn't know what to do, as every time I brought this up to them they would scream at me or tell me I'm brainwashed by my school. A giant reason for them taking my siblings out of public school and eventually me is because the school had students wear masks for a month due to the government's COVID-19 regulation.\n\nThis was only for a month so I had no problem, and I went on through my school year like normal, expecting to come back next year, yet they had ripped my accounts out of the school system and my parents instead signed me up for an education course on Khan Academy.

So for holiday parties or just because I felt like it I'd randomly bring in my Great grandma's chocolate chip cookies (that I made but her recipe.) Not often, only a couple times a year, 5 on the extreme end.\n\nEveryone LOVES them even people who claim to not like cookies normally.  \n\nRandomly my job sends me to the southern office and I'd randomly bring them cookies as well when I got there. Well apparently I didn't do it the last two trips and someone in the southern office felt this warrented a complaint to the CEO since this hurt their feeling!  Now granted this is a sub 50 person company and the CEO has an open door policy. But comeon really?  \n\nSo the CEO tells me that people complained last time that I was down there that I didn't bring them cookies and I needed to make it right next trip.  WHAT THE BLAZES! \n\nI can't be the only one who thinks this is crazy petty and disappointed both in my southern coworkers and in the CEO that he didn't tell them to just be thankful when I do bring them.\n\nI'm not going to disobey the CEO, but you better bet that I'm going to be mixing and baking them on company time now. I was ordered to make them by the CEO so it's Buisness time now. \n\nThoughts on if this is crazy or not?\n\nEdit: For clarity it wasn't a write up or anything, but his tone was a cross between annoyance that he had to deal with this and wanting me to make it go away, and unbelief that he had to deal with this in the first place.  Not his joking/teasing tone. That tone is very distinctive.\n\nEdit 2: correcting autocorrect.\n\nUpdate: Man this blew up!  So a couple of things to clarify from the comments and an update.\n\n1. I'm male, for those who find that weird Gordon Ramsay would like a word with you.  Also the deer on my wall at home don't care. \n2. The southern office is in the southern part of a northern state and we're in the northern part of the same state so we call it the southern office.  So all the true southerners are off the hook.\n3. The CEO is technically out of both offices but primarily out of the northern office.  This was apparently caused by a southern office coworker who he won't name assuming that the northern office got the cookies all the time and this got their feeling hurt that they didn't so they decided to complain to the CEO that I wasnt being fair in my cookie distribution and that I was insulting the southern office by not bringing them.... \n\nI almost wish my imagination was good enough to make this up.\n\nUpdate: So I told my immediate supervisor about this, this morning and his response was about this, \""I wish I couldn't so easily believe that the southern office could be that petty but I can.  Well if the CEO wants you to make cookies you're making cookies. If he doesn't like it then he should have stood up for IT against this stupid pettiness.\""\n\n\nFinal update:  Oh man did this blow up WAY more than I expected. I appreciate everyone's advice. Some more than others.  \n\nTo those who took the time to phrase things professionally, you have my thanks for ideas on how to say it.\n\nTo those who suggested adding extra to the cookies or intentionally messing them up.

I was ambitious and had built a powerful CV. My dream career was idealistic, international, exciting, and notoriously poorly paid. I was never motivated by money. I was pretty committed to social justice, but really, I sought adventure, growth, and if I\u2019m being honest, power. Then I met, married, and started a family with a woman. Early in our relationship I convinced myself we had similar goals, but I think she was just reflecting my passions back at me. When we had our first child she became much more resistant to moving away from family to pursue career opportunities. Therefore at the end of my internship I convinced myself to take a lucrative local job. It was supposed to be a short term station.  Of course, short term stretched into the decade, as there was always something making \u201cnow\u201d not the right time to move. The pay has remained great, and it has made family building easy. But it isn\u2019t what I trained to do, nor what my ambitious younger self dreamed of doing. Now, with a house full of kids, I work the same job, without any real chance for promotion, and I have lost all my passion. I feel like I gave up, sold out, and settled for less than I deserved. I have real responsibilities now. I have kids, and I have the ability to provide them with stability and a good education. I\u2019m not just going to walk out on that role.

Fruitcake36,1589124754,,,246,gh3k6s,1444,careerguidance,"""It's probably the number 1 thing driving me into depression. I can't come to terms with the fact that as I'm coming to 30, never have I felt more certain that the idea of a 'career' or working for the rest of my life in some repetitive job just to support my housing, family and retirement, is just NO life.\n\nI'm not sure if it's bad experiences, or not knowing what exactly it is I want to do. Heck, I'm being paid 55k, but have already decided I will resign before the end of the year, leave London, and move back to my hometown (where opportunities are limited). This is simply because, after several years of slaving it out in an office, I so desperately miss feeling PURPOSE in life. Whether that's living under mum's roof and feeling the love of living with my family, being at University, and being surrounded by some of the best friends and richest experiences, being young and adventurous, traveling. Living life. \n\nEver since I graduated and got into the 'workforce', aka, sitting at my corporate desk all day every day, life has been a misery. Eeach and every day typically morphs into the same scenario, wake up early, feel tired, commute, spend x hours under intense stress, commute home, change, cook, wash dishes, maybe go gym, bed, repeat. Then the weekend. Even weekends are duller than they used to be because people are so busy or spend time with their other halves or whatever else.\n\nI came to realise through a lot of self-reflection during lockdown, that it's not the job, or the industry (I changed industry to mix it up and try something new). I realised that selling all of my time just to receive a paycheck, is nonsense. To the point where I'd rather resign and be unemployed whilst preparing for long-term travelling. It's strange because I want someone to tell me I'm barking mad, to leave a nice paid 55k job in the city for what I want - but you can't help what you feel. I'd imagine it's like a gay person and bottling up their feelings and then eventually coming out. For me, the truest thing I feel in my heart is that I just don't want to work 9-5 for the rest of my life, full stop. I want more out of life than living for the weekend, than defining my life and value by my 'work'. I can't derive value from anything else because I spend 80% of my waking time at work/commuting. No job has ever brought me any sense of purpose in life. It just draws me down further, gradually.\n\nI just think it's an incredble shame, that we spend our lives in the pursuit of careers, selling our health, our time, our relationships and everything else just to put money in the bank and jump on the old societal bandwagon of buying a house and settling down. I thought after going into uni and then into the exciting world of financial services, that I had life set. But suddenly, I could not want it less. Even the idea of spending 30 years paying off a mortgage disinterests me. I find it a grim and miserable idea. What's wrong with me? But scarily, there's no viable alternative. It seems though a lot of people around my age who think similarly travel, so that's what I'm considering also.\n\nAny others feel the same way?""","Anyone else graduated, got in a 'career' and realise there was more to life than work?",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gh3k6s/anyone_else_graduated_got_in_a_career_and_realise/,2020-05-10 15:32:34,May,2020

Fast forward to a year ago, I was promoted to an Ops Manager managing our warehouse, field techs, and a team of project coordinators. While the pay increases have been nice and has allowed me to live a comfortable life(got my own place, new car, etc.), I absolutely despise my day to day life and dread going into work daily.\n\nHere is my dilemma - this was my first job out of school, I do not have any other job experience. I have an associates degree in a completely unrelated field, so I can't use that to leverage any future opportunities(I also have no interest in finding a job in that field). \n\nI do however, have a passion for project management. While I do not currently have any certifications, I do manage multiple projects/clients daily. My current job is a mix of people management, project management, and customer service. I absolutely despise the people management aspect of the job, I used to be compassionaite when people had issues arise, but I feel like I've grown bitter and am turning into one of those managers who just wants the work to be completed so I can go home. However, I absolutely love the project management and customer service aspect of the business. I am very process oriented and love making our business more efficient to ensure our customers are happy.\n\nI am sure I could spin my current job duties into project management experience to potentially get my foot in the door, but I do feel like I would need to take a step back pay wise, and potentially in my career as well.

I am not cutout to lie to my team and cut off peoples livelihoods for no good reason than to save $157k for half a year when my company makes $20+B a year.

My fourth interview had the same VP another VP of enterprise as well as the strategic account manager. The fifth interview I got a tour of the building got to meet all of my peers and talk about the business plans for the future. The company is a conglomerate of four brands that supply things to schools and businesses. \nA week goes by and I get a call from HR saying that she has some exciting news for me. I was loved by everyone I interviewed with and they saw a promising future for me with the company so much so that they thought I was overqualified for the role I was applying for and that they were creating a new elevated role within the company they thought I would be perfect for.

I have no idea what was wrong but I\u2019ll describe to you the interview with the east coast territory sales manager. \nI started off thanking the man for being here today and taking the time to meet with me. I was excited and looking forward to working with and learning from someone who had over 20 years in the technology sales industry and I had really been looking forward to today. \nHis response was \u201coh you think you know about me i only heard about you two days ago.\u201d\nDefinitely not off to a good start.

I recently had the opportunity to interview for the Inside Account Representation role and I wanted to bring to your attention an unfortunate experience I had during my 5th interview session. I believe it's important to address this matter as it greatly impacted my perception of the company and the potential role I was excited about.\nDuring my interview with (name) the East Coast Territory Sales Manager, I encountered behavior that left me deeply unsettled and disheartened. I was met with disrespect, dismissiveness, and belittling comments that I found to be unprofessional and incongruent with the positive and inclusive culture that I had previously encountered throughout the interview process.\nI want to emphasize that I hold the utmost respect for (company) and the values it upholds. My intention in sharing this experience is to ensure that the company's commitment to fostering a respectful and inclusive environment continues to be upheld, even in challenging situations.\nI understand that interactions can sometimes be misinterpreted, and I did take into consideration that this could potentially be a potential hazing to see how I performed under pressure but I don\u2019t believe that berating a possible candidate over the course of an hour is a ethical practice. However, I strongly believe that open communication is key to addressing such concerns. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter further and provide more context.\nMy aim is not to escalate the situation unnecessarily but rather to contribute positively to the betterment of the company's interview process. I believe that addressing this issue transparently will help maintain the strong reputation that (company) holds within the industry.\nThank you for your time and consideration.

I started out in 2021 and I got a two-year contract.\n\nThey can't extend the internship, so the company would need to promote me if they want me to stick around. I've always received great feedback from the whole team, everyone \""loves to work with me\"", I'm a \""great professional\"" and all this other stuff.

I kept tackling on more and more work, including taking on some new responsibilities.\n\nFast-forward to this year, my contract runs out at the end of this month and no one is talking about this promotion or mentioning the possibility of it. I thought my hard work would be rewarded, but I eventually found out that's not enough in the corporate world. Anyway, I muster up enough courage to talk to both my manager and my manager's manager one day and they both give me a ton of excuses (\""We're on a hiring freeze\"", \""We don't have the head count\"", \""HR won't approve\"").\n\nI get it. Tough luck. It happens. I was pretty disappointed at first, but I (kinda) understood. A few days go by, and the whole team got an invite to a meeting. I asked around to see what it was about, but everyone played dumb. I don't know what I was expecting at first, but I was completely shocked when the day finally arrived.

Out of about 50 applications, I heard back from 5 employers, & scheduled an interview with 2, to which I never heard back from afterwards. My roommate was applying to jobs for almost 4 months before she finally was able to get an interview, & get a job. Many of my peers are struggling with this as well.\n\nI'm really just frustrated with this. I have never had issues finding employment before this. Is anyone else experiencing the same thing?

Unfortunately i screwed up badly. \n\nI was basically given a document detailing how to setup my local development environment. Which involves run a small script to create my own personal DB instance from some test data. After running the command i was supposed to copy the database url/password/username outputted by the command and configure my dev environment to point to that database. Unfortunately instead of copying the values outputted by the tool, i instead for whatever reason used the values the document had. \n\nUnfortunately apparently those values were actually for the production database (why they are documented in the dev setup guide i have no idea). Then from my understanding that the tests add fake data, and clear existing data between test runs which basically cleared all the data from the production database. Honestly i had no idea what i did and it wasn't about 30 or so minutes after did someone actually figure out/realize what i did.\n\nWhile what i had done was sinking in. The CTO told me to leave and never come back. He also informed me that apparently legal would need to get involved due to severity of the data loss. I basically offered and pleaded to let me help in someway to redeem my self and i was told that i \""completely fucked everything up\"". \n\nSo i left. I kept an eye on slack, and from what i can tell the backups were not restoring and it seemed like the entire dev team was on full on panic mode.

Honestly, if I wasn\u2019t terrified of getting fired during this market, I\u2019d would find this situation funny hilarious.\n\nDuring stand ups, My senior engineer has a *very* distinct sound in his background. It\u2019s  like a vacuum, but the pitch of the sound gets really low, then quickly becomes high-pitch. He was always a quiet, but very cheerful person with a thick Spanish accent. He also lives with his brother, who calls him by his nickname.\n\nLast Monday, I played COD late at night, and almost immediately, I heard somebody from the other team with that same vacuum pitch. They were winning and we started arguing, and that\u2019s when he finally started talking. It was exact same accent, and at that point, I was willing to put money that it was my senior.\n\nNear the end of the game, both of us were completely trash talking each other (nothing hateful, just small banter, apparently he\u2019s very competitive). It felt so out of character for him, he was laughing a lot; it was entertaining. As a joke, I called him out by his nickname, and he immediately goes quiet. I reached out to him after the game saying that it\u2019s me, and he doesn\u2019t respond at all. \n\nThe next day, his attitude is now cold. He\u2019s very silent during our calls, and isn\u2019t explaining things the way he used to in the past. I sent him a message during closing saying that I hoped I didn\u2019t offend him during the game, and I actually really respect them. He claims he has no idea what I\u2019m talking about, and just brushed me off. He remained dismissive the remainder of the week\n\nNow it\u2019s the weekend and Im trying to catch up on work, but Im lost on how to proceed with him. I feel like he\u2019s practically cutting me off. Im not sure what to do at this point. I even recorded the footage from the game, I heard it over again, and there was nothing offensive. He even started the trash talking. This feels so unreal, and I never thought something like this could happen.\n\nEdit: For reference, I have 4.5 years of experience. I carry my weight really well in the team and serve as a mentor for junior developers. I\u2019d  find it hilarious if one of the juniors came up to me and mentioned we met online\n\nEdit: I\u2019m going to clarify a couple of things, since there are a couple of misconceptions that are spreading\n\n1) My senior and I have been the only devs for nearly 2 years until 2020. We managed to hire a ton of new graduates ever since the Covid outbreak, and now we have a fully fledged team. There\u2019s a lot of work, but we have meetings to discuss how to properly mentor juniors and planning for tasks.\n\n2) We were on really close terms. I knew a lot about his personal life and vice versa. we were friendly. We\u2019ve had plenty of banter during our work meetings when we worked alone. This isn\u2019t some dude I just decided to friendly to. This was a friend that I knew for nearly half a decade. That\u2019s why I\u2019m shocked at his response\n\n3) I did not bother him repeatedly about this situation. The moment he went silent after I introduced myself during the game, i got the hint dropped it. It wasn\u2019t until I realized that work is currently being affected since our encounter that I sent an apology, hoping to mediate things and continue things as they were before.\n\n4) his nickname was something his brother called since they were kids. He personally enjoys the nickname and even has that set as his name in meetings. Everybody at work and his friends call him by it. Some juniors don\u2019t even know his full first name.\n\n5) I record a lot of gameplay, it\u2019s not something that I did out of context. I went to check on the recording because I wanted to verify if there was anything I said that was vulgar/offensive that might have led to this. He DOESNT know I have gameplay saved. There was NOTHING malicious, from both of us. if he\u2019s uncomfortable with the gameplay, i\u2019d delete it in an instant.\n\n6) my main issue is that his self-destructive attitude is blocking our development process. I\u2019m perfectly okay with pretending this never happened. But he\u2019s not addressing tasks / helping juniors nor is he acknowledging the issue. A lot of work is getting funneled towards me. I DONT mind working a 9-5, 40 hr week, but there are juniors who are need guidance, and if I abandon them, they are more likely going to fired, especially during this market.\n\nI thought this was a harmless scenario, and I hoped for advice to address how we can make things better. Instead, I\u2019m met with pitchforks about I fucked his life over, deserving to get fired along with the rest of the team. Seriously, hop off the echo chamber hive mind and quit exacerbating a situation far beyond then it really is. He needs to grow up and acknowledge that there\u2019s an issue instead of letting us burn in quiet. \n\nEverybody on this thread is trying to explain why he acted this way, but it definitely doesn\u2019t justify his actions. Nobody deserves to lose their way to pay bills or provide food on the table over something as ridiculous as this.

You will be able to recognize how to break down a problem into specific patterns, etc.\n\nOnce you have done 300-400 problems like this (it sounds like a lot, but remember.. you are NOT wasting hours per problem trying to solve it.. so you will go through A LOT of problems in a short amount of time.. the key is NOT to memorize, but to UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS), you can start going through company specific questions on leetcode by buying premium.

I have applied to many jobs this way, and I have sparingly seen a response. Why? Because I'm a shithead, and no one wants to hire a shithead.\n\nSo, what did I do instead, and what did all my other shithead friends do instead?\n\n# What The Hell To Do Instead\n\nHAVE A RESUME THAT LOOKS GOOD\n\nI have seen so many resumes from newgrads and junior engineers with the most *blegh* looking resumes. I am not talking content here - by now, I hope you know how to make your resume sound, and this is not going to be a guide on how to make your resume *sound* good. But for the love of God, if you're making your resume on microsoft word, do yourself a favor and [make yourself a resume on overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv) Or whatever you want. Make it look good. Overleaf makes it hella easy, especially if you're a developer. Don't know LaTeX? Neither do I, and I got by just fine, and, remember, I'm a shithead. You can figure it out, I promise.\n\nOkay, have a nice looking resume? Good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Use LinkedIn to Contact People. Seriously.\n\nI have never, ever, *ever*, sent an application randomly through one of those crap-chute websites and expected to ever hear anything back. And guess what? Lo and behold, I nearly never hear back. So, here's what I do.\n\nLet's say I want to apply to a Spotify job. I'll go to Spotify's \""careers at spotify\"" page, and look for two, three maximum, roles that sound right for me. Then, I go on [linkedin.com](https://linkedin.com) and search \""Spotify\"" and land on their company page. You should see something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/uoIPIXH).\n\nThen, I click on the [People](https://imgur.com/a/ZBT5oOg) tab.\n\nThen, I look at the [filters that are immediately available.](https://imgur.com/a/TQRLKxk)\n\nAnd I apply some filters!\n\nYou want people in Engineering. You want people who went to your college. You want people who studied what you studied. You want people who are first, second, or even third connections. Just add as many filters as *you* can. The more related they are to you, the better!\n\nThen, start mass-adding people that clear the filters. If they are already a connection - great, send them a message. If they went to your school (this is very helpful) - great, send them a message. If they have your first name - great, send them a message.\n\nIf they share fuck-all with you, great, send them a message!\n\nBut they have to accept your connection first, of course, if you don't have Linkedin premium. A lot of them will. Some of them won't. Whatever, doesn't matter. You really just want 1-3 people.\n\nOnce you have at least one person accept your connection request, send them a message! You don't want more than a paragraph. 1-2 sentences telling them why you are messaging them, 1-2 sentences introducing yourself, and 1-2 sentences to just shoot the shit. Something like:\n\n\""Hey, my name is Texzone, and I am messaging you because I am interested in a job at Spotify. These roles I have sent below seem like a great fit for me (send roles after sending the intro message), and, I would love if you could refer me. I am a newgrad interested in backend development with a focus in data engineering, and I have some experience under my belt that I think would be beneficial to Spotify. \\[insert line about your qualifications; seriously, Keep It Simple, Stupid\\]. Thank you so much for everything, and have a great day!\""\n\nThat's it.\n\n\""*But* u/texzone\\*, that's so annoying! I'm surely harassing them by doing this!\""\\*\n\nYou idiot. You know, if they refer you and you get accepted, most companies have a bonus that they offer the employee! It ranges anywhere from 2k-10k. And all they have to do is drag-and-drop your resume on some shitty internal portal, then continue picking their nose while watching whatever tiktok nonsense they were watching when you messaged them.\n\nEven if they don't get any money out of it, people like helping other people. Really, it's true. They do.\n\nAnd, with a referral, you are almost *guaranteed* an interview if you:\n\n1.\tHave a clean looking resume and it sounds good.\n2.\tYou are applying to a role that matches your background/experience, at least loosely.\n3.\tThat's it.\n4.\tYeah that's really it.\n5.\tI swear.\n\nEasy. I have applied to dozens upon dozens of jobs this way, and I have gotten interviews at nearly every single damn one. My resume isnt amazing. My experience isn't way out there. My friends? A lot of them had a clean looking resume, but had shit-all for experience. But they all got interviews as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am sharing this because I am forced to believe people aren't doing this, and are instead hitting submit on some portal. This is by far the worst god damn way to ever apply *anywhere* nowadays. Unless your resume is filled with jargon, years of experience, and a sprinkle of FAANG, forget this ever being a smart way to apply to jobs.\n\nSo, that's how I, a shithead, have gotten over a hundred (I'm seriously not kidding) interviews over three cycles of job hunts that lasted about 3-5 months each. I applied once when I graduated, once during COVID, and just finished a job hunt right now.\n\nI *now* have some impressive stuff on my resume, thankfully. I look less and less like a shithead, and more like a professional - much to the dismay of the world - and I *still* don't ever hear back (rarely) from applying to jobs \""normally.\"" I still do apply normally - I'll send out applications every month or so, even when I'm working, so I can keep interviewing and stay ontop of my interviewing game. But from, say, 50 applications I send out, I'll maybe hear one  response.\n\nBut when I apply the way I described above? If the person delivered, and referred me, I never *don't* hear back. Neither do my friends. And I will almost always find someone to refer me. So... yeah, I hope this helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: I guess this may not work for super small startups. Whatever.\n\n# FAQs\n\n1.\tIs this method something you would recommend for internships?\n   1. No, not really - this method is something that I strongly encourage for full time jobs. Internships, co-ops, etc - those are a different beast and I know nothing about that. A college internship? ...Maybe. A High school one? ...Unlikely.\n2.\t***AM I SUPPOSED TO SUBMIT MY APPLICATION BEFORE OR AFTER THEY REFER ME***\n   1. ***VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY MUCH AFTER! DONT APPLY, LET THEM APPLY FOR YOU!*** If you apply before they refer you, well, then, you applied, and they can no longer refer you. So don't apply unless they explicitly tell you to do so.\n3.\tAm I supposed to contact recruiters?\n   1. Yes. They are excellent. Yes, do contact them. But honestly I've just never really had much luck with them.\n4.\tDo I attach my resume unprompted?\n   1. Up to you really. I usually don't. But you can. Especially if u like it\n\n## Edit\n\nThis strategy may not be so effective anymore. Good luck, its rough out there right now.""","Referrals Are King - A Shithead Guide On Successfully Applying To Jobs, Even - ESPECIALLY - When You're A Shithead.",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uczkay/referrals_are_king_a_shithead_guide_on/,2022-04-27 09:29:55,April,2022

It forced these people - who, for example, had kids, were pregnant, and/or had a spouse already out of work during the pandemic - to choose between protecting their families from financial strain and protecting other workers from LoanStreet's exploitation. I doubt I would have taken on the risks I have if I had had a spouse or child that I was endangering by doing so. I am inspired to continue fighting by the former LoanStreet employees and people around the world who have thanked me for standing up for what's right. Ideally, this episode causes companies in general to think twice before exploiting their employees and empowers workers with knowledge of [their rights](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/employee-rights).\n* I am comfortable accepting the risk of some employers passing on me over this in the future. Those aren't companies I would want to work for, anyway. I currently have a good job with a company I trust and I have no doubt I could find another.

At 32 I'd decided that I fucking hate sales, I had no degree, and I saw no other real option for growth without one.  I saw that Software Engineer degrees were the #1 job on US World Report or something like that, and the salaries looked great, so I signed up for that degree plan in night school because I'd always liked computers.  I had no fucking idea how difficult this degree was going to be.  I have no passion for math and honestly not a huge interest in programming before, but I stuck with it and a few years later got my degree this last December.

I sat here and read this sub and looked on YouTube about how there's no jobs, and was basically having complete breakdowns several times a week.  I was a mess.  I also, had almost no idea how to code because the degree plan had just kicked my ass, so I was just barely keeping passing in my classes.

For two months, it was staring at every single Leetcode question and having no idea how to do it, meanwhile just getting job rejection letters in my e-mail.  Over and over and over.

Some, however, aren't able to perform at their full potential even though they know a bunch of stuff and super technical.\n\nUsually what blocks them is company/team/project specific things which they aren't able to figure out on their own.\n\nI used to be that guy 7 years ago. Asking my senior peers was such an issue for me. There was a sense of judgement which held me off from asking more than a predetermined number of questions to any senior guy in the team. Part of this also had to do something with the fact how douchebag some of the senior devs in my team were. A few would literally reply with wink emojis and sarcastic replies when I asked them for a help in solving merge conflicts in my initial years, after I tried to figure out on my own by staying awake whole night reading git articles and exploring stackoverflow like a maniac. Trust me, no matter how simple you think it is and that junior guy should know this, sometimes it literally is impossible for them.\n\nSome junior guys break out in company washrooms too.\n\nSeriously, some senior devs don't have tolerance around taking more than 4-5 questions a day from junior devs and it can be seen/felt through their body language. Their main excuse is they should figure it out on their own, but sometimes it's soul killing to the junior guys. Trust me, I have been there.\n\nKeeping my past in mind, I tell these things repeatedly to any new intern/junior who joins in my team.\n\n\""Hey, look, feel free to ask as many questions you want. I personally prefer to get asked more questions from you. The more you ask, the more we both learn. And, you know what, your mind will tell you to not ask more questions when you already asked me 4 doubts in a day (at this statement, they show their smiling/nodding face in video chat because it's the fact for them), but, don't listen to your mind. Thats' the limit you set in your mind thinking it's not ok to ask more than a few doubts a day to any person. I would be ok even if you ask me 50-100 things a day. So, feel free to throw them in my slack and never feel hesitated to ask your questions. Even if you personally think, this might be a silly doubt, throw it in. I will never judge you for that.\""\n\nThis gives them so much confidence and assurity to get unblocked fast and be more productive.

Space-Ape2000,1626882995,,,679,oosru6,3698,cscareerquestions,"""Not my main account because I know some of my coworkers/friends browse this sub and would recognize me.  I just want to rant and encourage people to keep looking for remote jobs and make the transition if they can/prefer it.\n\nSo last week, after a year or so working from home, I had to go back (for the first time in my career) into the office. According to my company, we should work from the office because it will increase collaboration and people will perform better.  Bunch of bs, but I had no other choice at the moment.\n\nSo first things first, instead of waking up at 8:20 and join a useless meeting at 8:30, be on mute and proceed to go make my breakfast and take my dog for a walk,  I now have to wake up at 7, get properly dressed (no more comfortable clothes), make sure I have lunch and breakfast prepped, get on the highway, drive, get there at 8:15, mindless chit chat till 8:30, join the same useless meeting on zoom (with coworkers from around the globe, what's the f. point? ) and now I HAVE to/MUST pretend to pay attention to something that has no relation to what I work with because well, I got no more flexibility on my surrounding environment.\n\nAt home, I invested in a nice work setup. I have a nice chair, a stand-up desk, wireless keyboard/mouse/headphones, 2 monitors that I can adjust, plus a private kitchen to make my snacks, and teas.\n\nThe first time I went to the office and I saw the work environment I felt ridiculous. It's a fucking cubicle, with a shitty keyboard, mouse, and headset. The best part is that the cubicle doesn't have tall walls so I can literally see/hear everything, including other people's monitors.  The monitors, of course, are facing the hallway, so you can't see who's walking behind you, but whoever walks past you can freely see what you are doing.  Manager's dream.\n\nI also have to wait in line now if I want to make some tea or something, delightful.\n\nAt home, I am able to have a quiet environment and be super productive. When I get a card, depending on what it is, I can finish it in 2-4 hours, and then I can focus on doing something else for the rest of the day (learning/training, other meetings, or just not work at all since I was able to be productive).\n\nAt the office, because of being constantly watched, I became lazy just to have something to hold on to/last for the rest of the day. I also noticed that my team members do the same.  Also for me, IT IS EXTREMELY HARD to actually focus with a lot of background noise and as I mentioned above, because of the cubicles, every time someone gets up (every 10 mins), or gets a phone call, my attention is drawn to that and I lose what focus I had.\n\nThe company kept saying we will be more productive at the office. That's the opposite of what I am seeing. My team is now taking longer for cards, and the amount of time wasted in the office is ridiculous. The number of people, mindless walking around, chit-chatting in cubicles, going out for lunch/ coffee breaks just to fill in the time is a joke(nothing wrong with that IMO, but I'd rather do that at home).\n\nI loved having a private bathroom at my house. I can go and do whatever I want to do in peace. At the office, welcome to the shitty stalls and pooping side by side because, yes, I do love the smell of people farting in the morning.\n\nThe people that wanted to go back into the office, after a week of going to work and lunches and whatnot, started to mention some stuff during the stand-ups and I quote:\n\n\""Are you guys feeling more tired than usual?

For a bit of background, I started working a couple of years ago as a dishwasher and made my way to where I am right now. I never had an easy path nor a college degree (I am self-taught with a small coding Bootcamp).\n\nJust because I prefer having a better quality of life/work, doesn't mean I am entitled. Instead of bickering with each other about who works harder or whatever, we should focus on having a better quality of life and trying to make it the norm.

Whenever he touches someone else\u2019s code he complains endlessly about how stupid they were or how bad the code is. At the same time, he\u2019s never really considered the readability of his code by another person. It\u2019s not tricky because he understands it.\n\nHe\u2019s worked at small companies where peer reviews weren\u2019t a thing when he was learning unfortunately and he\u2019s now developed an ego that make him immune to all criticism. Anyone who critiqued his code would be wrong 100% of the time because he\u2019s a senior lead grandmaster engineer. He\u2019s the only one who knows how [system he built] works so he\u2019s invaluable to the company. They train people to tiptoe around his \u201cdifficult personality\u201d or whatever euphemism the project team has assigned to him being an asshole.\n\nBob\u2019s code is never as good as he thinks it is. It\u2019s full of idiomatic quirks he developed over time like a programming accent that nobody else checked him on. It suffers because:\n\n-\tIt will never be better than his limited knowledge. He\u2019s a cup full of water and there\u2019s no room for more water. Anything he doesn\u2019t want to learn is a \u201cfad of the week.\u201d\n-\tAnyone reading his code becomes a forensic investigator who needs to decipher his little quirks instead of focusing on the problem being solved.\n\nDon\u2019t be like Bob. He\u2019s toxic. He\u2019s miserable to work with and creates a culture of mediocrity. His name (whatever it is at your office) is a slur for a difficult person.\n\nTo every junior engineer out there please burn into your mind:\n\n-\tAny code written more than 10 seconds ago is immediately garbage that was written by someone who was dumber than they are now. Good developers all have a shared understanding not to speak these thoughts aloud.\n-\tAll code is written for two audiences: the machine reading it and the poor slob who has to update/fix it in 4 years (maybe you). Tricky code is a middle finger to that second audience meant to show how smart you think you are.\n-\tEvery criticism you get is a gift, seek them out. You are not your code. Beg for criticism. Even when they\u2019re not right, trying to understand why they think they are is a valuable thought exercise. Start with the premise your wrong. Even if it\u2019s not phrased constructively take the part you need (the feedback) and ignore how it\u2019s delivered. \n-\tThe more you think you know the more your ego will try to sabotage your growth by convincing you you\u2019re always right and shutting out new knowledge.\n-\tRefusing to admit you\u2019re wrong about something is a show of insecurity. Admitting you\u2019re wrong about something (especially to a junior developer) is a flex that shows your knowledge/skills/authority isn\u2019t challenged by new information.\n-\tUnless you\u2019re entry level, helping less experienced/knowledgeable folks constructively is an implied part of your job.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.""",A plea to future and junior developers,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/kqd16b/a_plea_to_future_and_junior_developers/,2021-01-04 17:14:47,January,2021

Small company. <30 people. [**Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswu000) **told me my equity would start vesting after 12 months.** **After I started, they told me that they actually meant 12 months after the next quarterly board meeting, and I would only start to vest after 16 months.** I asked them to change it. They dragged their feet for months, pretending to work on it. **After 15 months of praising my work, they abruptly fired me just as COVID froze tech hiring, refused to vest any of the promised equity, and the head of HR (who is also the wife of the CEO and who had spoken to me warmly just the night before) refused to answer my phone calls asking for an explanation.** LoanStreet is run by fancy lawyers and they were crafty with the offer letter language so I had no legal case. The offer letter said the details of the equity compensation would come in a different document, which they didn't provide for almost a year after I joined. **If it was a good-faith error, they could have done the right thing and granted me what I earned.

The engineer didn't remember why he had made the change and refused to help me investigate why tests were failing. I privately spoke to him to ask him to be careful with the code in that area because it was tricky, to leave comments if he writes something that might be confusing to another reader, and to feel free to ask me for help in that area since it was my niche in the company. I was trying to do him a favor by not making a more public stink about it. He immediately complained to the CTO, who called me 30 min later to sternly tell me that there was no error because we had tests that would have caught it and to scold me for going out of my lane. I wrote a failing test proving that the error existed and that our tests were incomplete. Then I fixed the error. He brusquely told me to fix anything I had broken by making that change. At the next retro \""needs improvement\"" section I said I hoped we could affirm a team norm of being responsible for your code: being able to explain it and to help fix things if it breaks something. Larry Adams got mad and shut down the conversation. **For the next few weeks he worked behind my back to get me fired.**\n\n[**Cofounder/CEO Ian Lampl**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-lampl-b7a5b684/), his wife and [**head of HR Alyssa Guttman**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssa-guttman-37133a4)**,** [**COO Christopher Wu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswu222)**,** [**CTO Larry Adams**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-a-2a20111), and [**General Counsel Thaddeus Pittney**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tlpitney) are the people chiefly responsible for what happened.\n\nCopying my [**Glassdoor review**](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-LoanStreet-NY-RVW48294594.htm) below. Please follow the link and mark it as helpful so that the message is amplified and as many people are warned as possible. LoanStreet fires people without warning and makes severance dependent on signing a permanent non-disparagement agreement, so we need to elevate the negative reviews they do have.** They have no legal fees because many of the top people are lawyers, and so they intimidate people into keeping their stories to themselves, even with \""anonymous\"" outlets like Glassdoor available.\n\n**Pros**\n\n*They are willing to give boot camp grads a chance*\n\n**Cons**\n\n*TLDR: Stay far, far away unless you're truly desperate. LoanStreet is a raging dumpster fire and you will get burned like many before. After 15 months of praising my work - and as COVID froze the hiring markets in 2020 - they abruptly fired me and withheld $100k in options that they promised me before I was hired.*\n\n*The annualized turnover rate in the small NYC office during my time there was around 50%. Every two months or so, someone was fired who said they weren\u2019t given any warning and the company would tell the same story that this person was given many warnings and opportunities to respond to feedback. I saw a lot of good workers blindsided, some leaving in tears. I thought it was fishy and eventually it happened to me, despite always having received glowing praise from leadership.*\n\n*Any promises made to you to entice you to sign an offer should be regarded with extreme skepticism. Get everything in writing and reviewed by a good lawyer.*\n\n*After hiring employees with a promise of unlimited PTO, management rolled out a PTO tracking tool that explicitly capped PTO at 15 days per year.*\n\n*Before I joined, Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu told me that the first quarter of my stock options would vest after a year. My offer letter said details on the equity compensation would be provided in a separate equity agreement. I wasn't provided that agreement for nearly a year after my start date, and you can imagine my surprise when I saw that I wouldn't begin to vest until nearly 16 months of employment. After 15 months of work, I was abruptly fired and didn't receive a single option.*\n\n*Because the offer letter omitted the details of the equity compensation, labor lawyers told me I had no case. Keep in mind, LoanStreet is run by lawyers who used to worth at Cravath, a very prestigious and lucrative NYC law firm. I suspect they knew exactly what they were doing when they wrote the offer letter. If it was just a good-faith mistake, they could have done the right thing and granted me the options I earned. They chose not to.*\n\n*Placing my trust in LoanStreet was a costly mistake. If you're reading this, please don\u2019t be fooled by the Series B funding or the impressive pedigrees of the leaders; this place is a fraudulent, exploitative mess and you have a good chance of being fired within a year.*\n\n*CEO Ian Lampl is the ringleader of this racket, but Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu, CTO Larry Adams and the rest of leadership are his spineless sycophants. They either agree with Lampl's despicable abuses of his employees or are too cowardly to stand up for what's right.*\n\n*This group will twist employees\u2019 arms to post positive reviews after they see this one, just like they have in the past, but this review is the real story and just the tip of the iceberg, given LoanStreet's practice of paying fired employees to sign permanent non-disparagement agreements.*\n\n*You deserve to be treated with dignity. Work elsewhere.*\n\n**Advice to Management**\n\n*Your exploitation of people is disgusting. Look in the mirror and ask yourselves how your loved ones would feel if they knew that you cheat people just to make your big piles of cash a little bigger*""",Name and Shame: LoanStreet (NY) cheated me out of equity,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o3jpfc/name_and_shame_loanstreet_ny_cheated_me_out_of/,2021-06-19 16:20:34,June,2021

Covid happen and was laid off during the height of pandemic. Couldn't code at home because of abusive enviorment. Rented a co-working space when everyone was staying home.

Focus on one thing at a time.\n2. Be brave and leave a toxic home enviorment. You won't be able to actually digest material if you are in constant state of fight or flight.\n3. Watch out for coding anxiety. Don't code for the sake of coding. Think about what you want to achieve. Use bloom taxonomy to learn deeply.\n4. Take your time, and pace yourself accordingly.\n5. Believe in the process and believe in yourself.  \n\n\nTook god damn 6 years because I was constantly in state of anxiety and flight mode. Took me 6 months to readjust to a healthy baseline.

Always loved tech but coming from an extremely poor family i was never introduced or had guidance to coding until college. I do recall learning how to make a website with dreamweaver as a freshie. But I loved tech since i was a kid.\n\nI believe coding is just the modern day carpenter and anyone can do it.\n\nEdit2. I did not get FANNG nor was asked an algro question.

It didn't have the problems that Blizzard has - it was far from \""frat boy\"" - it was more Office Space-esque cynicism.  It affected me far more than I realized, because as a young professional, I sought approval from my older peers and bosses.  I wanted to *fit in*, so I behaved the way they did.  And it hurt me personally and professionally.  I was completely blind to it at the time, but in hindsight, I was surrounded by bitter, jaded, poisonous people, and I became that way myself.\n\nI know it seems slimy to call the perpretrators at Blizzard victims too, but many of them are, because work does that to you.  When you spend 40 hours a week for years on end with a group of people, their behavior and attitudes (aka, their culture) *will* affect you, no matter how hard you think it won't.\n\nDon't let that happen to you.  If you find yourself at a company that tolerates anything even approaching the way Blizzard let its male employees treat its female employees, do something about it, or quit, or both.  I know the market is tough and that's easier said than done, but even if your conscience doesn't demand it, guilt by association is a real thing.  Blizzard was an amazing name on your resume until about a week ago.  Now it's a liability.\n\nIf there's one explanation for the Blizzard debacle, it's that evil perpetuates when good men do nothing.\n\nEDIT: To be clear - I'm not blaming the victims here, nor am I suggesting perpetrators are blameless.

For the upcoming months, I poured over \""Cracking the Coding Interview\"" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and completed MIT's 6.006 course. I wore my best slacks, but despite this, my interviewer dismissed me the moment I came onto the call. I have difficulty enunciating, as I have no teeth, and due to this lacking of mine, my interviewer began to coo at me, saying \""Who's a smart boy? Who's the cutest boy in the world?\"". He then turned to someone off camera and said, \""I think someone just... left their kid at the computer and didn't show up for the interview...?\"" Fools! How insulting.. my parents are gainfully employed. And I knew the answer to his query, \""who's the cutest boy\"" was me, of course - my mother tells me as such daily, but what could I say to that clear repudiation of my technical skill? \n\nOne interview, in particular, sticks out in my mind as being the worst instance of neonate-ism that I have experienced in my lifetime.

I'm an avid contributor to many JavaScript open source projects and I understand the ins and outs of neural networks. I am starting to believe that they don't want to test my coding skills after all... perhaps my fatal flaw is the lack of years of experience with each language. I feel as though my coding prowess itself is adequate, however, I have only been coding for the last five months, as that is when my fine motor skills had developed sufficiently for me to type. Prior to that, I was reading up on CS theory, discrete mathematics, and linear algebra. I suspect that my interviewers are seeking out employees with more months of experience. \n\nI'm wondering if others have experienced something similar in their travails in technical coding interviews.

I tend to see any variation of \""Is this offer good?\"" or, \""Why do I have to grind leetcode?!\"". Most of the on-the-job posts consist of \""I am in a toxic environment\"" or \""Should I change jobs?\""\n\nI have a piece of career advice for anyone who is fairly new to the field that I think could prove helpful. \n\nFirst, a little about me as while I'm not going to hinder my anonymity I do feel I'm in a position where I can rightly prescribe advice to newer SE's / grads / those still school: I'm a Principal Engineer, and have a wide array of experience across operations (including release / implementation) as well as experience developing user-facing code, and internal tooling used organization-wide. I've worked in the DOD, networking space, e-commerce, and fin-tech. \n\nJobs I've held include:\n\n* Software engineer (senior/staff/principal)\n* DevOps Engineer\n* Lead DevOps engineer\n* Lead Site Reliability Engineer\n* Tech Lead\n* Software Development Manager\n* Director of Operations\n\nOne of the greatest skill deficiencies I see in engineers has always been communication. Communication is a very important part of our job. It allows us to promote our ideas, defend our solutions, play the Devil's Advocate, request help, refuse help, patronize others as well as compliment them. We can use communication to self-promote or self-deprecate. Communication literally sets us apart from every other species on this planet; that's not to say other species can't communicate, but that you won't see one chimpanzee explaining to another what the functional use of a blow-hole in Blue Whales is after explaining the nuances in their childrens' respective behavior while foraging for food. \n\nHere is a hard reality for many engineers: ***Even if you are the best software developer at your entire company, getting others (employees, external customers, internal customers) to actually use what you wrote is a different beast than writing a tool.***\n\nHere is another hard reality: ***Many tasks rely on others to \""un-block us\"". There are of course times when the blocker is stubborn enough that solid communication doesn't help, but solid communication never hurts.*** \n\nIt's not uncommon for a developer to feel like a priority queue that relies on other priority queues which are poorly optimized, and plagued with race-conditions. \n\nBelow are some points I'd like to make on the subject of communication:\n\n**Being direct is not mutually exclusive with being polite**. I often find overtly rude people fall on the \""I'm just direct and straightforward!\"" excuse as though it actually is an excuse for their rudeness. Consider different ways to say the same thing. This SR, and many others, while not inherently controversial (rudeness is often derived from controversial topics), is plagued with what I'd call \""direct rudeness\"". Most of us who have posted here at one point or another have been faced with someone who disagreed but failed to do so in a way that made us feel any productive discussion was possible. \n\nConsider the following two versions of the same sentence (email threads I've actually witnessed, redacted of course):\n\n>Hello \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, you are writing a tool that duplicates work done in a tool I've already written. You need to do a better job of communicating what you're working on so we aren't constantly creating duplicate work and wasting time.\n\nHowever, consider had it been structured slightly differently:\n\n>Hello \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, I noticed you're contributing to a tool which I found here(assume a link to source). I'd like to learn more about your specific needs and perhaps discuss whether $TOOL\\_I\\_ALREADY\\_WROTE would fit them, and if not perhaps we could discuss continuing your thread of work towards enhancing the existing tool-set by adding any features you find it's lacking, as there is certainly some overlap. It'd be great if we could avoid duplicate efforts and enhance a tool that's already in use by the organization. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nBoth sentences communicate the same message, but the former puts the recipient on the defensive and immediately raises a few barriers in their mind. Upon receiving it they will be texting / chatting most of their close-colleagues about what a jerk you were. You turned your potential meeting on the topic into a street brawl instead of a discussion. Sometimes it can work out, but why cause additional stress? \n\nI'd argue that the second version of the sentence still gets the point across but puts the recipient and relative ease and opens a dialogue. To expand upon it a bit more in the second version we acknowledge that the recipient is writing a tool, and raise the concern on the overlapping functionality of that tool with an existing one. The purpose of the email is clearly stated as a goal; avoiding overlap. It's not an accusation but a goal and the use of 'we' puts a collective goal in the recipient's mind. Closing with \""Let me know your thoughts.\"" opens a dialogue whereas the over-directness of the first version never actually indicates any interest in a dialogue or common goal.\n\n**Everyone is busy, even when they aren't.** We all need things from colleagues, and some colleagues are naturally more busy than others, and some seem like they're never actually working on anything. It's not our job as developers / individual contributors to judge another's workload (and if it is you should evaluate your company's situation). Many things are cyclical and you may be faced with situations where you need a thing done by someone you do not particularly enjoy working with. I have found strategies in communicating with such people that have been effective, for the most part. \n\nPeople love when you acknowledge \""how busy they are\"" even when they aren't ever really busy from your perspective. Consider two people asking you for help:\n\n>Hey \\_\\_\\_\\_, can you please do \\_\\_\\_\\_ for me? This is very urgent and blocking $IMPORTANT\\_THING.\n\nConsider that your $IMPORTANT\\_THING isn't always their $IMPORTANT\\_THING. Your emergency isn't always theirs. In a company that is unified it certainly should be, and we should all be empathetic and helpful when we can and have the bandwidth, but it's not always the hand we're dealt. Consider this slight change:\n\n>Hey \\_\\_\\_\\_, I know you're really busy and I'm sorry to bother you! We have an urgent ongoing issue and I'd really, really appreciate it if you could take some time to look!\n\nKeep in mind these are all suggestions and things that have worked for me, but I've had much better luck with using the second version over the first. To reiterate: People love to appear busy. Especially at work. I don't know what it is about perpetually being busy, but it's a badge of honor in our work culture and to not be busy is to not be relevant. ***Also keep in mind that you yourself are not a metric by which to judge people. If you put in 80 hours a week at your salaried job, that's your prerogative. Do not hold that expectation of others.***\n\n**Strong opinions are still opinions.** This one is very relevant in our field as there are many subjects which are inherently based on opinions which draw a lot of controversy. Spaces vs tabs, programming syntax, which language to use, which tools to use, log formatting, etc.. Sometimes we're opinionated about the problems that need to be solved. Do they need to be solved? What's the reason we're solving it?\n\nAlways be self-aware of when you're prescribing your opinion vs. when you're prescribing factual-based information. Pick your battles. If you like tabs, and the project uses spaces, that is not the battle to pick. It's not even really worth a mention unless you can do it without being a jerk. If you want to prescribe your strong opinions onto others then be prepared to back up why you wish to do so.\n\nI recommend being objective, always. Do not make statements that cannot be backed up with other objective statements and explanations.\n\nIdentify why you're so strongly opinionated. Can you present your opinion in a way which shows it derives some mutual benefit?\n\nSometimes one opinion can be stronger than another opinion but this is usually rooted in **facts or history.** For example, the spaces vs. tabs talk is inherently based on opinion. If you walk into a project which uses tabs, and you are a spaces person, you ***do not just reformat the whole project to spaces. This will only make you appear to be an asshole.*** This is also a case where your ***opinion is wrong. Not in that one is superior to the other, but the fact that now when I run a diff in SCM across to revisions, you just created a shit-ton of change where there actually was none, making debugging harder and all because you felt your opinion was superior.*** \n\n**In closing -** I just wanted to possibly help some others in their communication style by providing some examples where I saw what I'd consider communication miss / failure, and examples that have personally worked wonders for me. I'm open to any additional input / advice / suggestions that could help others, as well, including if you want to indicate anywhere you disagree with the things I've said and make suggestions I might not have considered.\n\nJust always be aware that if you aren't communicating at your job, something is wrong. If you aren't communicating ***effectively*** then you are going to hit unnecessary hurdles in your career; a career that is inherently difficult to navigate given the constant churn on technological advancement / changes. I highly recommend any new engineer to host as many lunch and learns, and project demos as they can (code you wrote, tools you wrote, etc..) to improve these skills early in their career, as it will pay massive dividends in the years to come. As for written communication, if you are communicating something that feels edgy / difficult, then sit on it for a bit and proof-read / reread it. Pretend you're the recipient and how you'd respond if you received it from yourself. Consider your relationship with the person you're sending to, and how they respond to and consume various types of communication. Always be learning about your peers and learn how to navigate their personalities in ways that increases your success without inhibiting theirs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.""",Please don't neglect your communication skills in favor of improving your leetcode skills,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qc50hf/please_dont_neglect_your_communication_skills_in/,2021-10-20 16:38:22,October,2021
yeahdude78,1663915062,,,592,xlptfl,2943,cscareerquestions,"""This post is not meant to discourage anyone. Nor is it a statistically valid study. I was just curious and decided to do a fun experiment.\n\nI have been hearing recently about how everyone should \""learn to code\"", and how there are mass amounts of people going into computer science in university, or teaching themselves to code.\n\nWhat puzzled me is that if there are so many people entering the field, why is it still paying so much? why are companies saying they can't find engineers? Something was not adding up and I decided to investigate.\n\nSo I spent a few months asking \\~500 people on this sub if they were able to teach themselves enough to become an actual software engineer and get a job. I made sure to find people who had posted at least 1-1.5 years ago, but I went back and dug up to 3 years ago.\n\nOut of the 500 people I asked, I had a response rate of 267. Some took several weeks, sometimes months to get back to me. To be quite honest, I'm surprised at how high the response rate was (typically the average for \""surveys\"" like this is around 30%).\n\nWhat I asked was quite simple:\n\n1. Were you able to get a position as a software engineer?\n2. If the answer to #1 is no, are you still looking?\n3. If the answer to #2 is no, why did you stop?\n\nThese are the most common answers that I received:\n\nQuestion # 1:\n\n\\- 12 / 267 (roughly 4.5%) of respondents said they were able to become software engineers and find a job.\n\nQuestion # 2:\n\n\\- Of the remaining 255, 29 of them (roughly 11%) were still looking to get a job in the field\n\nQuestion # 3:\n\nSince this was open ended, there were various reasons but I grouped up the most common answers, with many respondents giving multiple answers:\n\n1. \""I realized I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would\"" - 191 out of 226 people (84%)\n2. \""I didn't learn enough to be job ready\"" - 175 out of 226 people (77%)\n3. \""I got bored with programming\"" - 143 out of 226 people (63%)\n4. \""It was too difficult / had trouble understanding\"" - 108 out of 226 people (48%)\n5. \""I did not receive any interviews\"" - 58 out of 226 people (26%)\n6. \""Decided to pursue other areas in tech\"" - 45 out of 226 people (20%)\n7. \""Got rejected several times in interviews and gave up\"" - 27 out of 226 people (12%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, that was my little experiment. I'm sure I could have asked better questions, or maybe visualized all of this data is a neat way (I might still do that). But the results were a bit surprising. Less than 5% were actually able to find a job, which explains my initial questions at the start of this post. Companies are dying to hire engineers because there still isn't that large of a percentage of people who actually are willing to do the work.\n\nBut yeah, this was just a fun little experiment. Don't use these stats for anything official. I am not a statistician whatsoever. ""","I asked 500 people on this r/learnprogramming if they were able to become software engineers.

Yes, you can self teach yourself everything you need to know over 2-4 years, maybe 1 if you really cram, and you can build up a portfolio. So then what is your plan to get a developer job? You're going to nail the technical assessments? Ok, cool. How are you going to get the interviews? Your resume, assuming you put a lot of effort into making it look good, will always look like shit compared to even people who went to a boot camp let alone got a CS degree and are competing for that entry level job as well.\n\nLook, it's no secret that college is overpriced, it's expensive, you won't learn specific job skills like React there, etc. etc. I get that plenty of people get into the industry without a CS degree. I'm one of them. However, I also was able to get dev experience at my old job and get a couple interviews because of having 1.5 YOE of dev experience to get my current job. My old job I only got because I have a bachelor and master's degree in a field that old job was interested in. Oh yeah, I sent out 200 applications and got 2 interviews. 1 offer. The interview that resulted in an offer came from a referral I got by dumb luck.\n\nThe thing is that theoretically you could teach yourself everything you need to know in far less than 4 years and for damn near free with all the resources out there. If you have never gone to college yet though, you're about to graduate HS, etc. though it just amazes me at the stupidity of the idea of not wanting to go to college and just take the easy way out. You're not taking the easy way out by eschewing college and a CS degree. You're taking the hard way out because you're going to be one of those baby turtles hatching on the beach and trying to make it to the water. A few will make it...most will get eaten.\n\nIf you want to roll the dice with your life and career, sure go for it, I guess you can always go to college after you most likely fail to get an entry level job self teaching yourself. The only cost to you is time which of course you'll never get back. I personally don't understand why you would intentionally try to sabotage your life though. As an aside, if you're older and thinking of breaking into the field at the age of 25, 30, 35, etc. don't worry about this comment. I'm 37 and just broke in a couple years ago myself. I do feel like I need to \""catch up\"" in terms of career but it's fine. Time is indeed a very real cost though and should be considered when making important life decisions.\n\nAnd to be clear, this is specifically directed at people who are of traditional college age, or about to be, who have no debt, kids, etc. getting in the way of them going to college. I just wanted to point out, as someone who is self taught themselves, that going the self-taught route is brutal as fuck and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.\n\nEdited to add: Some people seem to misunderstand the intent of this post. Not sure if I could have worded it better or their reading comprehension is terrible. At any rate, I'm not saying you're nothing or somehow \""less\"" for not going to college. I'm saying that HR / recruiters will most likely filter out your resume for stronger resumes because the vast majority of your competition will have degrees and you won't. It has nothing to do with how good you are at development. It has everything to do with how qualified HR / recruiters think you are for the job posting they're trying to fill. It's common sense but enough people are questioning it that I guess I'll use a very simplistic example. 1 entry level job posting gets 600 applications. Very common thing to happen. Let's say 300 applications have CS degrees, 200 have boot camp certs, 100 are self taught. They want to pick 20 or 30 to interview. Why even look at the self taught? Hell it may be tough for the boot camp certs to get interviews. From the standpoint of trying to find candidates, most likely they'll pull the best looking 20-30 resumes from the CS degree applicants. It just is what it is.""",Stop asking if a CS degree is worth it if you are young and haven't started college yet,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/od4wu5/stop_asking_if_a_cs_degree_is_worth_it_if_you_are/,2021-07-03 19:43:00,July,2021

Azianese,1701802468,,,709,18bj8pz,2751,cscareerquestions,"""TLDR: Stop framing every opinion as fact.\n\nThe worst part of this sub is not the amount of bad advice (which is already astounding on its own). It's the amount of kids who are confidently incorrect and voice their inexperienced opinions as fact. \n\nThe problem is the new grads who think their limited experience is representative of the whole industry. The problem is the college kids who think their limited interactions with CS folks makes them an expert. The problem is the high schoolers who see the above commenters and blindly regurgitate that garbage.\n\nThe problem is that the above people almost always fail to qualify their statements with what their background actually is. \n\n* They fail to say, \""I've seen others say....\""\n* They fail to say, \""As someone still in college, I think....\""\n* Instead, they say, \""This is how things are.\""\n\nFor a sub about career questions/advice, how are the newly initiated supposed to differentiate the hot garbage from actual, useful advice? (Hint: They don't! Because y'all love to upvote the disinformation to the top too!)\n\nHere's a taste of my own experiences interacting with people from this sub:\n\n* Someone suggested big tech has about the same WLB as a \""chill government job.\"" What did they do when I confronted them about it? They tried to straw man me by saying I believe all big tech was 60 hour work weeks.\n* Someone was overinflating Bay Area rent prices. What did they do when I confronted them about it? They proudly claimed that their Canadian ass knew better than my 20+ years of living here because they looked up the price of a specific apartment in SF next to a train station.\n* Someone claimed something iffy about the hiring process (I forgot what by now). What did they do when I asked them for a source for their statement? They referred to their astounding experience of setting up career fairs...as a student.\n\nThere's a reason why more experienced folks think this sub has become trash. It's become flooded with ego-boosted kids who comment as if they've never been wrong a single time in their lives. It's full of the CS-stereotype kids who like to double down on their mistakes because they're insecure about the possibility of being wrong. Oh, you've had 4 years of college experience? Congrats! You still don't know shit.\n\nBut there's a solution! Simply qualify your statements. It's ok to voice your opinion. And we're all wrong sometimes. But don't give others a false impression of how accurate your comments are by framing every single opinion as fact.\n\nEdit: And for all of you compelled to leave an uninspired comment about me stating everything as fact, feel free to contribute to the convo here: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/s/B328DfIEVG\n\nAnd regardless of whether or not my post applies the same way, feel free to read up here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque""","Many of you are ruining this sub, and you don't even know it.",0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/18bj8pz/many_of_you_are_ruining_this_sub_and_you_dont/,2023-12-05 18:54:28,December,2023

Bootcamp graduate. Based in the UK.\n\n**How the interview process went:**\n\n* CEO: \\*is impressed by resume, thinks I'll be a great fit\n* Lead dev: \\*Asks me some React questions - I answer them. Asks me if I know Redux and I said no.\n* Lead dev: \\*Gives me a React challenge which is apparently one of the features of their product. I finish it and add some extra features I think will make the app have a better user experience.\n* CEO a few days later \\*says lead dev was really impressed by my work\n\nI get an offer. I am very happy. **The lead dev seems extremely nice and tells me to ask him any question whenever I might need help or get stuck.**\n\nDay 1 - Day - 3: I see that the codebase is really messy. Some parts use JavaScript, some use TypeScript. Some use class components, some use functional components. Some files are extremely massive which can be broken down into smaller components/chunks. I was already told that they hired lousy devs in the past and that the codebase is trash now. I am given to implement some design changes for the login, sign up and a forgot password page. It's my first day and I dunno where is what, I make some simple changes on my own branch. Second and third day, I am almost done. Just some design tweaks here and there.\n\nThese 3 days I asked the lead dev lots of questions, most were on git as I was struggling to rebase my branch off of development and merging with development instead of master. He happily helped me and in some cases he told me to problem solve it on my own, which I successfully did.\n\nDay 4: I have to make two components interact with each other and from the codebase it wasn't obvious to me that they are parent-child. Even though I dunno Redux, I thought that is possibly the only way to implement the interaction. I ask the lead dev about it (previously he told me before my first day that he will give me a crash course on it) and he said **we'll jump on a call soon** (we work remotely) - so ***he*** **offered to help**.\n\nHe sees the problem and lets me realize that they are parent child, and so I can just pass props (no prop drilling required). I had to pass the prop from child (written as function) to parent (written in class) and I got a bit confused and asked him what will be the best way to tackle it - he says \\`${myName} that's very basic\\`. I realize its probably a dumb question and asked him not to worry about it and that I'll figure it out.\n\n**NOTE**: I know I'm expected to know React, which I do and would have solved this on my own - just got slightly confused and since we were already on a call and I have been told before that I can ask for help whenever I need, I went ahead and asked it. As you know I was initially expecting some Redux topics to get knowledge on and how it has been used on the codebase.\n\nDay 5: Starts with a meeting, where the CEO says that the lead dev said that I ask a lot of questions that I can just \""google\"". The lead dev said I asked a very basic question and that I don't know how to pass props. Funny thing? - the feature I worked, I literally made an extra component myself to keep my files cleaner. The component is of course reusable and can be used throughout the codebase. So I respectfully told him that if I didn't know how to pass props I couldn't have created the component and used it.\n\nHe didn't reply to that and just closed of saying I wouldn't be a good fit. He further added something like, \""Ik I said, you can ask for help/ask questions. Well that isn't quite true\"". I was shocked.\n\nP.S: Worst thing about this experience? The first 3 days of my work, I had 3 interviews (one with a *very* big company). When I got the job, I cancelled interviews with all 3.""","Fired on my 5th day because I asked a ""basic question"" on my 4th day.",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r67an5/fired_on_my_5th_day_because_i_asked_a_basic/,2021-12-01 05:24:13,December,2021

Build Tools  \n(Maven, MSBuild, NPM) This is similar to CI/CD, knowing how to correctly compile your programs and managing its dependencies is actually somewhat hard.\n\n\n5. Database  \n(SQL Server, MongoDB, PostgreSQL)  \nBeing able to optimise SQL scripts, create well designed schemas. Persistent storage is the foundation of any web app, if it\u2019s wobbly your codebase will be even more wobblier.\n\n\n6.

I'm happy to answer any questions for anybody who has them.  \n\nMy first job out of school was for 77k, my second job was 140k -> 165k after a promotion, and my third job is over 300k now.\n\nHere are my interview stats from this interview run.

I had my Capital One and Attentive onsites before any important ones, and they were crucial in my later onsites. Case in point, I failed my first onsite (Attentive) but passed my next 3 \n4. For practicing Leetcode, quality > quantity. I did about 70 Leetcodes spread across graphs, trees, dynamic programming, string puzzles, array puzzles, linked lists, LRU cache/binary search/hash map from arrays type questions, etc. If you can't pick up on the general patterns by then, you should work on your approach and question quality\n5. Work on your resume. Go on resume review sites and pay for reviews. Post every week in this subreddit. It's important\n6. Know your language. Practice/document all syntax things you will need to do all types of questions. Don't let this be the thing that fails you \n6. Document all of your Leetcode studying/DS Algo studying/behavorial answer prep in Google drive or something.

It is one of those two-year rotational programs. I was given the opportunity to apply to this Fortune 500 company through a recruiter, who then invited me to a Woman's Superday they were having. I passed and was given an offer. \n\nA few months later, the company asked me and everyone else in my program to fill out a skills and interests survey so that they can match us up with teams. I was put on a team whose technology I had never used nor indicated an interest in. That is fine, and I am learning a lot. However, in a conversation I had with my manager's manager a few months into the job, he told me that I was picked for my team because I was a woman and they had not had one on their team before.\n\nFinally, yesterday I was at a town hall and there was a question and answer session at the end. At the end, the speaker asked if no women had any questions, because I guess he wanted a question from a woman!\n\nI am getting kind of frustrated at the feeling of only being wanted for my gender. I don't feel \""imposter syndrome\"" - I am getting along great with my team and putting out good work for my experience. I think I am just annoyed with the amount of attention being placed on something I can't change. I wish I was invited to apply based on my developing ability, placed on my team because of my skillset and interests, asked for input because they wanted MY input, not a woman's.\n\nDoes anyone relate to what I am saying or am I just complaining to complain? I don't really know how to deal with this. Thanks for reading.\n\nEdit: I am super shocked at the amount of replies and conversations this post has sparked. I have read thorough most of them and a lot were super helpful. I\u2019m feeling a lot better about being a woman in technology.

Heck, publish everyone's salaries. i am tired of finding out my coworker of a different race gets paid more than me for the same work. Like I can understand like 10% difference but not more than 35%.

This was just a personal rant.

Thought it may be of interest to some of you to provide an hour-by-hour breakdown of a good day vs. a bad day in banking. This is just based on my own personal experience and every day was pretty different so treat this as a bit of a general overview.   \n\n\n**A Good Day**\n\nHere\u2019s what a good day would look like and I\u2019ll assume I\u2019m mainly working on a few marketing books which means we haven't signed on the client yet and we\u2019re just trying to win business \n\n* **8:30AM:** Wake up around and scroll through \\~20 emails and see that nothing requires immediate attention so snooze for another 15 minutes. Luckily, I live super close to the office (a must do if you\u2019re a banker) so I get ready and get to the office around 9:30AM \n* **10:00AM:** I get my desk set up and answer a few emails but given that my projects are pretty quiet, I ask my analyst buddy if he\u2019d like to go get a breakfast burrito with me \n* **10:30AM:** I hurry back to my desk for a conference call for a potential IPO that we\u2019re working on. Luckily as an analyst, you don\u2019t ever have to say anything so I quietly eat my burrito and take notes I can send to my team \n* **10:30AM - 12:30PM:** For the next few hours, I start working on spreading trading comps which is one of the ways to value a company for a marketing book I\u2019m working on. Trading comps entails going through financial statements, looking up financial metrics, and copy pasting them into an excel spreadsheet. At first it was fun, but now that I\u2019ve done this hundreds of times, it\u2019s a little boring. \n* **12:30PM:** It\u2019s now around lunchtime and I go out with a few analysts and associates to grab a sandwich to eat back at the desk.\u00a0 \n* **1230PM - 3:00PM:** I scarf the sandwich down and get back to work on the trading comps and start double checking all my numbers. I then create a nice chart to showcase all the numbers and print it out for my associate. Since I got my pages done, now I can relax a bit for my associate to check over the work. I check on my NBA fantasy team, start texting my friends to see what plans they have for the weekend, etc. \n* **5:00PM:** My associate is done checking over the page and says the numbers look good but wants a few formatting changes, so I quickly make those and send the full presentation to our team for their review. We now play the waiting game again, and this is often why bankers stay late into the night. Even though we finished our pages by 5PM, our Managing Director is out there having a life and responding ASAP to some analysts still in the office isn\u2019t exactly his number one priority \n* **7:00PM:** I go back to surfing the web and grab dinner to bring back to the office and finally get our comments at 7PM. Our MD gives us a list of 15 changes, which isn\u2019t too bad since they\u2019re all pretty quick fixes. \n* **7:00PM - 9:30PM:** For the next few hours, I finish up all the changes and send it over to my associate and VP, who are both at home now. They both check over everything and give me a few more comments. I make those changes and send them back the revised version. \n* **10:00PM:**\u00a0Team gets back to me saying the presentation is good to go. I send it to our printing office who creates prints and binds the books into professional looking booklets \n* **11:30PM:**\u00a0I pick up the books from the printing office and drop them off at my MD\u2019s desk and call an Uber home \n* **12:15AM:** I take a quick shower and crawl into bed, watch a show and crash \n* **Commentary:** This is a relatively easy day even though I didn\u2019t necessarily leave the office early (sometimes I would leave from 8PM-10PM on some really really good days). But the work wasn\u2019t intense and there was some waiting around which feels a little more like free time. \n\n**A Bad Day**\n\nNext up is a bad day, and here, I\u2019ll be assuming I\u2019m on an intense live M&A deal \n\n* **7:00AM:** The worst start to a bad day is that you haven\u2019t slept much the day before so let\u2019s say I slept at 3AM and am now waking up at 7AM \n   * Not only did I not get much sleep, sometimes, my seniors or clients might be on the East Coast, which means I have to wake up early since I worked on the West Coast \n   * I wake up to 50 emails and slightly panic because 10 minutes ago, my MD asked for some changes to the presentation I sent out last night in advance of our 9AM call \n   * I email my associate that I am working on the changes on my phone and boot up my computer which is just a few feet away from my bed \n   * I work like a madman for an hour turning comments and send it to my associate and while waiting for comments, I brush my teeth and put on my suit \n* **8:30AM:** By the time I\u2019m in the office, my associate has provided me a few comments and after making them, I send it off to the client \n* **9:00AM:** I have a short breather for about 5 minutes before jumping on a conference call with a client. Let\u2019s say that we\u2019re in the beginning stages of an M&A deal and the call is about valuation \n   * For the next 30 minutes, I take notes on the call and at the end, I learn that the client has finished making changes to its management model and will be sending it to us right after the call so we can build financial models based on their figures \n* **9:30AM:** Right after the call, the model is sent to us, and my associate and I each take the next 2 hours going through the model and trying to understand how everything flows (any reputable company will have an internal financial model it uses to project its next few years). Bankers use this model to build out valuation materials but these models can often be really hairy, confusing, and unorganized \n   * Usually it takes more than 2 hours to dissect a management model if it\u2019s really complicated, but let\u2019s just say for our purposes it takes 2 hours to briefly look through all the tabs \n* **11:30AM:** My associate and I discuss the questions we have in the model and set up a call with the client at 12PM \n   * In the meantime, my Managing Director wants the latest information about the company, so I compile the latest equity research reports of our client and send it to him \n* **12:00PM:** My associate leads the call and asks our questions about the model while I take notes and during this time, my co-worker drops off a salad at my desk since I won\u2019t have any time to grab lunch myself \n* **1:00PM:** My associate and I run into a meeting in our MD\u2019s office to discuss what we need to do. \n   * Our MD lays out to us the presentation materials he wants page by page, referencing old materials we can recycle and update and laying out the financial analysis that we need to do \n   * During this meeting, my associate and I are furiously taking down notes so that we don\u2019t miss anything \n* **2:00PM:**\u00a0I scarf down my salad which is the first thing I\u2019ve eaten all day and then get working on the model first while my associate puts together a shell of the presentation \n   * Over the next 5 hours, I\u2019m using the management\u2019s model to create a discounted cash flow analysis which is one of the ways to value a company \n* **7:00PM:**\u00a0I send over the model to my associate who starts checking over it while I work on the rest of the presentation which involves updating market overview slides and spreading trading and transaction comps. I also hop on a food order with my colleagues for dinner during this time \n* **8:00PM:**\u00a0My associate gives me changes to make to the model which I refocus my attention to and work on for the next 4 hours \n* **12:00AM:**\u00a0I\u2019m finally done with the next draft of the model, which I send to my associate, who tells me to work on the other parts of the presentation and focus on the model tomorrow \n* **4:00AM:**\u00a0I finish making updates to the market overview pages, finish spreading the trading and transaction comps, and send all of these materials to my associate and then head home to crash \n* **Commentary:** It's certainly possible to have 1-4 weeks of many 2AM-4AM nights in a row. Usually an intense live deal also meant working 20+ hours on the weekends (though you could sleep in a bit). I'd say about 20% of my days were bad days, 20% good, and 60% in between.""",Day in the Life of an Investment Banker - A Good Day vs. Bad Day,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/m0guw9/day_in_the_life_of_an_investment_banker_a_good/,2021-03-08 14:30:47,March,2021

I\u2019m now a 3rd year Investment Banking Analyst in M&A at a reputable boutique (think Raine / Union Square Advisors, etc.) and currently in the process of interviewing for my next role in private equity.\n\nI am also an interviewer for full-time analysts at our bank.\n\n**The purpose of this post** is to provide a guide for those that have an interview or multiple processes kicking off within \\~2-3 weeks and don\u2019t have time to do the extensive prep that everyone suggests (e.g. reading all of Rosenbaum & Pearl, understanding all the detailed accounting nuances in 3-statement modelling, etc.)\n\n**Before we dive in,** I am mostly providing this guide for those interviewing for **investment banking** positions. The reason, aside from my experience here, is that for most of the high finance roles that finance prospects are seeking (e.g. **private equity, venture capital, hedge fund**), investment banking is often a pre-requisite before you are taking seriously.\n\n**This guide is not for you if** you are interviewing for consulting, asset management, private wealth management, corporate banking, commercial banking, direct / commercial lending.\n\nNow, without further ado, here is my recommended **2-week (14 day) study plan:**\n\n**Days 1 \u2013 5: Baseline Technical Preparation:** The 400 Investment Banking Questions & Answers\n\nLink: [https://www.academia.edu/36852692/The\\_400\\_Investment\\_Banking\\_Interview\\_Questions\\_and\\_Answers\\_You\\_Need\\_to\\_Know?auto=download](https://www.academia.edu/36852692/The_400_Investment_Banking_Interview_Questions_and_Answers_You_Need_to_Know?auto=download)\n\nThis is your bible for technical questions. If you know every Q&A in here, you are ready for 90% of the technical that will be thrown your way, so I recommend the first week to be completely dedicated to this.\n\nMake sure as you go through this, you are understanding the reasons behind every answer. If you don\u2019t know a term, search it up. Focus on the \u201cBasic\u201d questions in each of the sections in this guide. That will cover about 80% of the technical you receive. The \u201cAdvanced\u201d questions will occasionally pop up, but are much less likely (\\~10%)\n\nIf you have the chance, definitely go through them as well, but if crunched on time, much more important to fully understand the \u201cBasic\u201d\n\n**Days 6 \u2013 7: Group-Specific Technical Preparation**\n\nThis will be a bit more nuanced depending on which group you are interviewing for. I am mostly an M&A guy, and the Basic + Advanced sections of the previous guide are pretty much all that\u2019s necessary. However, if you are interviewing for any other group, wallstreetoasis.com is your best friend.\n\nSearch up specific technical for you group on that site. Try and contribute an interview review to the site, which will give you access to the company database. This contains interview reviews on many different financial institutions, and you **there\u2019s a solid chance you can find specific interview questions for the company you are interviewing for in the reviews!**\n\n**Day 8: Resume Walkthrough**\n\nEvery interview will kick off with \u201cTell me about yourself\u201d / \u201cWalk me through your resume\u201d / some variation of this question\n\nRehearse in front of a mirror / record yourself (I used Photobooth on Mac) doing this many many many times. Your walkthrough should be \\~2-3 minutes and follow the below structure:\n\n1. *Background (\\~10 \u2013 20 seconds)*: Where you were born / raised and what interested you in finance / why you chose your college\n2. *Early College Path* (*\\~20 \u2013 30 seconds*): Talk about what your major choice was / why, and any research / internships you had done\n3. *What Brings You Here Today* (*\\~30 \u2013 45 seconds*): Here you establish the \u201cspark\u201d that led you to pursue the role your interviewing for and how the role fits in your 10 year plan\n\nExample Answer:\n\n\u201c*I was born in the UK, but raised in Manhattan. I grew up very interested in the markets, and have traded my own personal portfolio since high school. For college, I decided to attend Harvard given their strength in economics and well-rounded education program*\n\n*At Harvard, I majored in economics, joining the HBS Investment Club in my first year, where I began understanding the nuances of valuation and the key metrics in evaluating the potential of a business.*  *This inspired me to pursue a role at \\[x\\] family office during my Sophomore summer, where I evaluated both private companies and public equities for potential investment.*\n\n*Through this internship, I discovered that while I enjoyed trading public equities, my passion really came from being able to dive deep into a company\u2019s business and financial profile in order to understand how their strategic decisions allow them to outperform their competitors and the broader market. Therefore, this role as a Summer Analyst at JP Morgan in M&A will provide an excellent opportunity for me to fully continue pursuing detailed analysis of businesses, and I believe my perspective coming from an investing background will allow me to add value during this internship program.\u201d*\n\n**Day 9: Behavioral / Fit Preparation (Part 1: The Generics)** \n\nThe 400 Questions have a lot of these questions in there and suggested responses. The below are the ones I have personally gotten / ask in my interviews:\n\n1. 3 Greatest Strengths and Weaknesses\n2. In your last role, what would your boss say about you?\n3. How do you deal with a teammate that you disagree with?\n4. Do you prefer working independently or in a collaborative environment?\n5. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? (hint: say something about a long term career in whatever you are interviewing for)\n6. What do you do for fun?\n7. Tell me about a recent book you read and liked.\n\n**Day 10-11: Behavioral / Fit Preparation (Part 2: Why Us? / Do you know what we do?)**\n\n1. Why do you want to work at \\[x\\] Bank / \\[y\\] Group / \\[z\\] Industry?\n2. Why Bulge Bracket vs. Boutique?\n3. Tell me about a recent deal that you read about.\n4. Have you read our website? Tell me what you think about a recent transaction we advised on.\n5. ELI5 \\[x investment banking role\\]\n6. What are the tasks you expect to do here?\n7. What do you think a deal process look like here?\n\n**Day 12: General Business Sense / Case Preparation**\n\nYou will encounter these scattered throughout, and they can take a number of forms. Broadly speaking there are **3 categories**: **(1) Business Strategy Questions, (2) Market Sizing, (3) Brainteasers.** Again the 400 questions guide has a bunch of these.\n\nThe first category is the most vague, and can take the form of \u201cWhat are the key aspects of a successful business in x industry?\u201d / \u201cYou have a company with $50 million in revenue, growing at 40% annually but with negative EBITDA margins. If you were advising this company on a sale, what would you ask management?\u201d / \u201cHow would you think about valuation for a lemonade stand in Manhattan?\u201d\n\nThese questions are extremely variable and the best way to prepare is to familiarize yourself with common academic frameworks (SWOT analysis, Porter\u2019s 5 forces, etc.)\n\nThe second category is classic consulting-like market-sizing questions, e.g. \u201cWhat is the market size for toothbrushes in the US?\u201d / \u201cHow many rats are there in New York City?\u201d / \u201cHow many people die in the US each year?\u201d\n\nThis is just practice, and I frankly don\u2019t have much advice here besides googling consulting case questions for these. However, keep it simple and don\u2019t break the market down into 15 segments and not be able to calculate the final answer. Make sure you walk the interviewer through each step as you work through the solution.\n\nThe third category is classic IQ-question like brainteasers, which can encompass puzzle questions, mental math, probability, etc. This is quite rare, but you will likely encounter at least 1-2 of these. I don\u2019t recommend spending too much time prepping for this part, as they are rare and don\u2019t often make much of a difference if you nail everything else.\n\n**Day 13 - 14: Loose Ends & Rehearsal**\n\nThis is flex time for whatever you haven\u2019t finished in the last 2 weeks. If you have completed all the previous steps, some recommendations:\n\n\\-**Google your interviewer** if you know their name and see if you have any overlapping interests / experiences. If you bring these up early on in the interview, you can sometimes sidetrack the interviewer into talking about this for a good chunk of the time, lowering the amount of time they have to drill you on technical\n\n\\-**Read up on industry / company news** for the firm you are interviewing with\n\n\\-**Go back to the 400 questions and go through the Advanced section**\n\n**-Rehearse your Resume walkthrough like a madman.** First impressions can often determine the tone and difficulty of the rest of the interview\n\nGood luck my fellow monkeys.""",Breaking into High Finance: 2 Week Study Plan for the Unprepared,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jg3jfj/breaking_into_high_finance_2_week_study_plan_for/,2020-10-22 16:57:03,October,2020

During my schooling days every time I told people what I wanted to achieve out of life, I always get laughed at. To be honest, I was never a serious guy and I had always been the class clown. But, after experiencing the loss of my mother and my best friend to suicide at the tender age of 19. I was depressed and contemplated suicide multiple times. However, I wanted to make my mom proud and I was tired of being the 'plan B guy' and tired of being on the 'waiting list' thus I decided to focus on my goals.\n\n3 years later as a final-year student, I am an offer holder at J.P Morgan for a graduate programme. During my penultimate year, I received 3 internship offers from my national sovereign wealth fund (Fixed Investment), biggest national bank (Equity Research) and Citi (Retail Bank) which I ultimately took.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Apologies in advance for the massive schizopost, but people have to know what they\u2019re getting into.\n\nThere is an abundance of \""Avoid Northwestern\"" threads out there, but outside of the typical \u201cthey make you call your friends and family,\u201d or the \u201c[they sell you expensive whole life insurance you don\u2019t need](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/14hdate/just_infuriated_a_northwestern_mutual_guy_because/)\u201d posts, I haven\u2019t seen any that really disclose the behind-the-scenes borderline-MLM fuckery happening. Now, while the model isn't built on recruiting and earning residual income from recruits, I think there's a discussion to be had over how practices widespread in MLM cults seep into wider industry practices. In NWM's case, red flags include training that revolves largely around prospecting, widespread unethical practices that involve exploiting friends and family, [a weird cult-like atmosphere at conferences and meetings](https://www.thepitchkc.com/the-hard-sell-2/), and finally, how exactly their hiring process functions as a magnet for the under-informed and financially desperate. On top of this, seasoned ex-advisors with a conscience realize that the compensation structure is [at odds with upholding fiduciary duties](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/confessions-of-a-financial-advisor/) (more on this).\n\nI truly hope my experience will lead to some positive change and potentially prevent others from suffering needlessly.\n\n**----The Beginning----**\n\nWhen I received a referral to work at Northwestern, I was in a pretty rough spot in my life. I had been unemployed for roughly six months, I was living in a remote area with virtually no job prospects, and I was starting to put rent on credit cards. The situation seemed incredibly hopeless. I received a call from a recruiter in my home town who said she had \u201cheard great things about me\u201d from an advisor at the firm\u2014 an acquaintance who I hadn\u2019t spoken to in years. The company seemed reputable enough, after all, Northwestern Mutual has the [HiGhEsT FiNaNcIaL sTrEnGtH rAtInG](https://www.northwesternmutual.com/financial-information/), and some of my more established friends had policies through them, so it must be a good enough place to work. Truthfully, I was just happy someone wanted to hire me.\n\n**----The Interview----**\n\nThe interview process was exactly what you have probably already read in other posts\u2014 they tell you how amazing you are, how it\u2019s an incredible opportunity to live Life by Design\u2122. They tell how you\u2019re going to absolutely kill it, how you have an aura of trustworthiness, and how that\u2019s what makes people successful in the business. They ask you about your relationship with your family and friends, reputational questions, deeper questions about purpose and what matters to you.\n\nDuring the third interview, my Managing Director revealed the results of a personality assessment. Based on my answers, I was categorized as a \""Rainmaker\""-- a personality trait common to the top x% of earners, or something like that. Truthfully, I am a bit worried about sharing internal documents, so I'll provide a high-level overview of my earning *projections*:\n\n*Annual revenue:*\n\n* By 40 years old: $860k\n* By 50 years old: $1.6m\n* By 60 years old: $2.5m.\n\nMy total career earnings were *estimated* at **$60 million, including a retirement package of** a single-life annuity worth **$200k per year** and a Persistency Fee Guarantee Fund value of **$1.5m yearly**.\n\nImagine how many people, with limited career experience and even less financial literacy, gawk at these numbers. I can't help but remember someone describing the career as a \""lottery ticket\"" at a conference. Normally, I'd call bullshit, but let's be real. If there's a commonality between applicants, it is desperation. Financial Representatives don't usually accept a job at Northwestern Mutual from a place of abundance.\n\nAlong with several emails saying \u201cWelcome Home,\u201d they sent me an offer letter celebrating my \""aptitude\"" and other traits. They welcomed me to a company \u201cwhere you control your own destiny.\u201d\u00a0\n\n**----The Training Process----**\n\nOkay, we all know that before your start date, you\u2019re required to get your life and health insurance licenses and are **strongly** advised to bring in a list of 200 contacts. Nobody talks about what training is like.\u00a0\n\nYour first day is the start of NM\u2019s **Financial Planning Academy**\u2014 part of their National Training Program, which is about 40-50 people in a crowded RingCentral call. Anyway, to call this complete waste of a time a \u201cFinancial Planning Academy\u201d is charitable. It\u2019s, at best, life insurance sales training. To save having to list the entire schedule, here\u2019s a quick gist:\n\n* Week 1: Design statements (alarming shit, more on this), learning how to prospect, learning sales language\n* Weeks 2-3: Phoning to set appointments begins on your FOURTH DAY. Some product training (really, nothing substantial.) You learn some shit about [their financial planning software called PX](https://retirementincomejournal.com/article/northwestern-mutual-life-rolls-out-px-planning-experience-adviser-interface/?pdf=12948), which is no MoneyGuidePro. It's a glorified insurance recommendation tool.\n* Week 4: You spend time in the office and **start compliance training on the last day. After you've called, messaged, and emailed 200 of your friends and family. This is like a regulator's wet dream.**\n\nIf Northwestern Mutual had a platform that properly educated its new hires on insurance **and** investments, maybe then its employees could market themselves as [Financial Advisors](https://www.northwesternmutual.com/financial-advisor/). Unfortunately, common sense doesn\u2019t dictate that not being registered to offer financial advice means no one should trust you as a Financial Advisor. There are actually representatives two years into the business without securities licenses who are marketing themselves as  \u201cfiduciaries\u201d! Hope regulators turn a blind eye!\u00a0\n\nMoreover, I was actively discouraged against pursuing securities licensing quickly by my \u201cbusiness\u201d coaches, because there was \u201cso much to learn\u201d about the business (of selling life insurance). The reality is, they don\u2019t measure your performance by Assets Under Management or advisory business, they measure with insurance premiums. And ultimately, you don\u2019t make boatloads of money selling term insurance. It was always about permanent life insurance, not advisory.\u00a0\n\n**Okay, but onto the design statement thing\u2026**\n\nThe first day of training featured presenting a \u201cDesign Statement\u201d in front of your training class, fellow representatives, sales support people, and upper management. I don't think a single post has talked about this. It's essentially a letter to yourself written by future you. You\u2019re highly encouraged to be as vulnerable as possible, and emphasize how much the \u201ccareer\u201d at Northwestern Mutual has made a difference. I heard my fellow trainees share stories of poverty, unemployment, family problems, imposter syndrome, coupled with lavish dreams of becoming a millionaire in a few  years and buying their parents a house. They express how excited they are to no longer have to work a corporate job\u2014 to have autonomy over their lives. Northwestern Mutual is a career unlike any other! It\u2019s an *extremely* emotional affair. It\u2019s a real \u201cthis is the first day of the rest of your life\u201d moment. Everyone is super supportive, and you leave feeling like you\u2019ve joined a family of future millionaires. You're on a track to success, because everyone has told you the system is foolproof. You just have to put in the work.\n\nCompanies like Northwestern Mutual are microcosms of everything wrong with hustle culture. I do believe that if you're able, you should work hard to achieve things that are meaningful to you. However, hustle culture weaponizes meritocratic myths to justify unethical and unhealthy business practices.\n\nIf you're familiar with the MLM space, you're familiar with \""trust the system\"" rhetoric. Successful representatives of companies like ACN or Monat will insist that the \""system works,\u201d and elevate the incredibly small  percentage of representatives who become successful. The reality is, if the system was capable of producing these outcomes on a large scale, it would. Insisting that the \u201csystem works\u201d absolves the system of responsibility. Instead, these companies will market themselves as self-directed opportunities to create generational wealth for you and your family. If you fail, it\u2019s just \u201cnot for you,\u201d or you simply did not work hard enough. The only thing getting in the way of your success is you.\n\nOkay, so how do you get paid?\n\n**----The Compensation Process----**\n\nHere\u2019s what getting paid at NM looks like:\n\nNorthwestern Mutual has two programs to help kick off your \""business\"": the Business Acceleration Program (BAP, basically commission % bonuses for the first couple years) and TAP (Training Allowance Program).\n\nTAP is how you make money in the beginning, so I\u2019ll start here:\n\n* After training, your stipend is a conditional $2000/month, which is authorized by your \""coach\"". You earn $500/per week if you make 40 dials, set 5 appointments and record 6 activity points per day (for putting new prospects into the CRM, taking a Fact Finder, etc.). There are additional new client bonuses, and a bonus for completing your securities licenses (again, not necessary or encouraged by admin).\n* Suppose you work 40 hours per week,  that\u2019s $12.50 an hour. You make below minimum wage, conditionally. (Also working 40/week is discouraged; training videos of NWM\u2019s annual conference feature a salesperson touting that you have to be willing to work 3-4 nights per week when you start). Mathematically, you can quickly understand how, if you bring in 200 contacts, you run out of people to call quickly. Eventually, if you don't make your dials, you don't get paid. Anything. No proration. Simple as that. You can make your dials but not set enough appointments. No stipend, sorry. But hey, it's your business, and you can fail. Most businesses fail, so it's okay, right? Right?\n* You have no benefits until your full-time contract flip date. Full-stop.\n* Another note about the TAP stipend. The majority of people don't get their full TAP stipend. You can ask any rep. Missing the stipend is normal.\n* If applying out of state, you are only reimbursed for your two most expensive licenses. If you leave before then, you can go fuck yourself!\n* **If you leave, expect them to charge you for expenses related to holding a part-time contract. Chargebacks are common, but home office tries to nickle and dime you as you're walking out the door.**\n\n**----Joint Work and the Sales Process----**\n\nThe Northwestern Mutual solicitation process has multiple steps:\n\n1. The approach. A NM rep calls you, ideally keeping it as vague as humanly possible so as to not give away too many details, with the aim of setting an appointment to collect financial information for product recommendations. A typical script goes something like, \u201cHey Michael! How are you? I know we haven\u2019t spoke in a long time, but I\u2019m really excited to let you know that I\u2019ve started a financial planning practice. I\u2019d love to borrow no more than 30 minutes of your time to see if I can help you reach your goals.\u201d\n2. The Fact-Finder: This is the first appointment where NM reps learn about you in order to make proper recommendations. Obviously, suitability is important. But advisors use this as an opportunity to \u201ceducate\u201d you on how insurance planning is a foundational element of financial stability. You get introduced to a \u201c**Joint Work Partner**.\u201d Typically, newer representatives are paired with more experienced representatives, to which they have little to no ongoing business relationship. So if you catch yourself in a meeting with one of your friends who is now a Financial Advisor, chances are they just met their \u201cpartner\u201d a few weeks prior. Wow, you should totally trust these people with your financial future!\n   1. The \u201cselling\u201d may begin here. Usually you\u2019ll get a \u201chouse and buckets\u201d explanation: imagine a multi-layered house representing your overall financial picture. Your \u201cfoundation\u201d includes an emergency fund, health insurance, **disability insurance** (marketed as \""income protection\"" and life insurance. Your upper levels are brokerage and retirement accounts (which lol @ no investment license). They\u2019ll probably woo you with NWMs \u201cunparalleled financial strength\u201d and so on.\u00a0\n3. Close meeting. Here, reps deliver the plan-- usually illustrations of what your career earnings would look like with and without disability insurance. You\u2019ll probably get a recommendation for permanent life insurance, often with the justification of being an alternative to the stock market. \""With a whole life policy, you can save on taxes and keep your money off the roller coaster!\"" I  had a representative try to sell an expensive WHOLE LIFE POLICY to a low income couple with no retirement savings or investment experience using that reasoning.\u00a0\n\nJoint Work partners will take at least 50%, and if you leave, they keep the client. If your client cancels the policy, you get charged back for commissions paid.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\----Leaving----\n\nLeaving the cult was one of the most stressful times in my life, bar none. After quickly realizing that the Financial Representative role wasn't for me, I started to look elsewhere. And when the team finds out, the tune changes *so* quickly, and the same \u201cif people don\u2019t support you, they were never meant for you\u201d mentality is applied against you. I was made to feel guilty for \""giving up\"" on myself and my dreams. I was told I was selling myself short. I was told that the company had already \""poured so many resources\"" into me. I was told I was acting disingenuously by leading the company on to believe I was in alignment with their philosophy. I was accused of not \""believing in protecting your income\"" when I expressed skepticism over blanket disability insurance recommendations. I was immediately removed as a LinkedIn connection from upper management. And on top of that, I was charged **hundreds of dollars for things never disclosed in my contract.** It was fucking awful.\n\nAnd, the real kicker is, the longer you stay in this as a rep, the higher the chances you'll deliver a death claim. And when you do, it's impossibly hard not to convince yourself the work you do is important enough to act unethically along the way.\n\nI truly feel bad for the people that get sucked into this. Northwestern Mutual is not an MLM but is predatory beyond belief. They sell you on a dream and expect you to rope your friends into supporting your new  \u201cbusiness.\u201d For the vast majority of people, it pays very little. And on the off chance that you do succeed, you\u2019ve probably had to act unethically. You\u2019ve probably jeopardized relationships selling life  insurance disguised as financial planning to your friends and family. Thankfully, I left less than a couple of months in for a much better job.\n\nAnd, the truth is, despite never delivering a policy, I still feel tremendous shame in having participated in something like this. I feel shame having contacted over 300 people out of the blue to talk about my new career. I wish I could tell them what an awful experience it was without seeming untrustworthy.\n\nIf you get approached by an NM Advisor, tread very, very carefully. I truly believe it is systemically difficult to maintain a fiduciary standard at Northwestern Mutual. Being tied to insurance product sales with a virtually non-existent base salary is exactly why people get recommended expensive whole life policies as a \u201ctax-advantaged vehicle\u201d instead of maxing out retirement contributions or adding to an emergency fund. It makes money for the salesperson.\n\nAnd if someone reaches out to you offering the FR job, please understand the full ramifications and make an informed decision, no matter how talented they say you are.""",Opening Up About Northwestern Mutual,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/14tb3t8/opening_up_about_northwestern_mutual/,2023-07-07 15:54:00,July,2023

Seriously did you do no homework or informational interviews?\n\n-Lack of technical prep: I would consider myself a pretty easy technical interviewer. I\u2019m more concerned with concepts than whether or not you know the formula for WACC. That being said, I did a round recently where no one even knew what enterprise value was. I recently had a candidate who had a sibling in IB who couldn\u2019t explain to me what an interest rate was. Do students not know how to use google these days? Pretty sure this is the most common technical interview question and I can\u2019t really even get through my case study without you getting it. \n\n-Entitlement: I\u2019ve interviewed some candidates that seemed bright but then we got to behaviorals and they indicate that some type of work is beneath them. As an intern, you\u2019re going to be doing a lot of work that is not demanding intellectually in exchange for exposure to IB.

When the engineer position opened up I scheduled a meeting with my manager to make my intent clear.  \n\n\n2011-2012 Helpdesk Engineer 45k/yr\n\nHere I was escalation for the techs. Continued to find ways to reduce tickets: self service password reset software, spearheaded windows 7 deployment, reviewed ticket logs, found ways to better leverage existing management tools.  Lobbied for MSFT to come in and do some training with me on SCCM so I could learn the ins and outs of managing a larger userbase (\\~1000 employees).  Constantly made contacts with the sysadmins, learned as much as I could about storage, virtualization, linux, etc.  Asked for extra projects. Came in to work an hour early every day and left 1-2 hours after quitting time.  Brainstormed ways to make a difference to the company I worked at to further reduce tickets or workloads from other teams.  \nScheduled a meeting with the sysadmin manager to make it clear to him that I was interested in being   a sysadmin on his team, and asked him what I could do to be the obvious choice for a promotion.  \nWithin 2-3mo I was on the team.  Got hands on experience with NetApp, 3PAR, & Linux.  Originally they wanted me for storage and I was happy to oblige.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2012-2015 Sysadmin 60k-85k/yr\n\nStarted out as storage admin at 60k as mentioned at the same company. Helped create volumes, raid groups, etc.  Called all of our vendors and asked them to teach me as much about storage as they were willing.  Went to a few classes for NetApp & 3PAR.  Got certified in NetApp (7mode at the time).  I started automating storage tasks with Powershell.  Got everything automated to where projects that would normally take several hours or days were done in minutes. (FC Storage zoning, for example).\n\nAfter a 6mo-year (my timelines are a little fuzzy, hard to remember) and getting this automated and refined, I started working more with the VMware team, learning as much as I could, worked with them on ways we could integrate with storage, I requested a few VMs with rights so I could learn more about VMware (note: this can be really hard in very large organizations where everything is highly controlled and silo'd).  Did the same as before, pushed on it.  One of the VMware guys quit.  I immediately scheduled a meeting with the VMware team manager.  I made it clear that I was interested in taking on the position, and that I had automated my previous role sufficiently to be able to handle both VMware and Storage tasks.  Stated I didn't want a pay raise, but instead requested a VMware VCP training course.  Did the same as before, find where things need to be efficient, find ways to save money for the company, find ways to learn more without your company needing to invest more.  Eventually I was handling Backups, VMware, Storage, Load Balancers (F5), & Physical Compute.  I did not take on or have interest in Network or Security.\n\nAfter another year and a half of doing this I scheduled a meeting with the CTO.  I explained that I was doing the job of five and that my salary was out of alignment, I kindly requested that he consider bringing my salary in to the ballpark of where a VMware/Storage administrator should be.  He offered me 75k. I said 85k was more than fair, especially considering what I was doing for the company.  He obliged.\n\nBecause I was handling so many different technologies on a day to day basis, I was also working with our vendors that sold us all of those projects.  I learned as much as I could about as many different technologies as possible.  Because I was responsible for what amounted to 5-10m of budget, because I had my hands in all parts of the org, had automated most of my tasks, I was involved in all technology purchases not related to Network or Security.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2015-2017 Systems Engineer 110k/yr\n\n1 year after the salary increase I applied to one of those vendors, or VARs (value added reseller).  I gave the company I worked for a 3 month notice.  They were unable to fill the position and contracted me back for 3 additional months while they proceeded to hire 4 people to replace me, I helped them interview. The new company asked me to move and laid me off after a total of 6 months of employment.  I found a new job 3 days later and accepted.  I worked for a very small outfit doing UCS/SRM deployment for 6 months and got a job at a local var.\n\nContinued to learn and push. Learned as much as I could. Bought a home lab. Had my own VMware environment (with free licenses).  Sold, implemented, and supported hardware from all sorts of verticals.  Still managed to stay away from Networking & Security.  If a client bought VEEAM, I would go get the same software I would be deploying for them and do it at home 3-4x before meeting up with the client.  I looked like a pro to the client and I had only used the software the day prior.\n\nStarted bugging the AWS guy to teach me more.  You're probably starting to see the pattern by now.  He quit and we were going to lose our AWS partnership unless someone got a solutions architect associate certification within the next two weeks.   I let my boss know that I would handle it, but I needed two weeks off to do it.  Studied every day, 12 hours a day up until the test.  Made my own AWS account and used my own credit card to get things going.  Bought an online training course and pushed on it.  Saved the partnership with AWS and they started giving me AWS projects to work on with clients.  \n\n\n2017-2020 Solutions Engineer/Architect 160k-190k\n\nManaged services & private cloud organization reached out to me to help them sell their cloud.  Note, this is all technical sales, NOT hard selling. My commission at the time was only about 20-30% of my pay.  Agreed to sign on. After 2 years of always learning, pushing, and going after more I scheduled a meeting with the Director for Solutions Architecture to make my intent known.  It was pretty funny actually, I've been doing so well (#1 across the company) that when I called him he said \""Ah man, I was hoping you'd call me\"" and I said \""Ah good, I'm sure you've been wanting me as a Solutions Architect and I'd be happy to work for you.  Let me know when the first interview is.\""  (note: I already knew the guy pretty well, heh, wasn't a cold meeting). Acted as Solutions Architect at around 190k for a year before I started to get incredibly bored.  I was only helping to sell a single product.  Set up kubernetes at home because it was a huge gap for the company and held trainings on containers.  I did not like learning about products that I couldn't sell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2020 - Today Solutions Engineer 240k\n\nTurned down a job at AWS as a Solutions Architect to work at a large VAR as a Solutions Engineer at the same pay.  I did not want to be limited to only AWS.  Yes, I realize how crazy a statement that can seem to some.  The company I'm at is quite large, but not the behemoth that is AWS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe path is there ladies & gentleman. You  have to want it so bad it hurts. So bad that you go home wondering how you can make a difference at work.  You go to sleep excited to learn the next new thing tomorrow.  So bad that you're not afraid to schedule a meeting with the CTO to tell him you want more out of your job.  That you'd be willing to make less to learn more.  That you want more pay because you have a track record showing that you've earned it.  That when you start to realize your value you recognize it and move to a new company, expecting a high salary as a result.  **You can't make salary jumps like this by staying at the same company.**\n\nI worked hard for this, and you can too.\n\nWhat's next? I'll keep pushing.  I think I want to be CTO at a company someday.  Not sure what that path looks like yet.\n\nIf this helps one person, it was worth the time to write it up.""",My journey from 18$/hr helpdesk to 240k+ over 12 years.

I honestly can not thank you enough for helping me through this hard situation, the advice and kind words you gave me really helped me get through it when I was really overwhelmed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn to the good stuff. I got a new job! Actually as a network engineer, a career move I was attempting to make but didn't have a lot of confidence. I want to thank everyone again for all the advice I've seen on the subreddit, I was able to get the necessary certs, learn a lot and got lucky enough to get an offer! I just started last week and I am overjoyed to learn something new and be tasked with a new challenge each day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for Jim. This was two days after the original confrontation and I was sitting at home looking for job postings, with my nose steadily healing and the cracked rib left me without much mobility. I could still move but it was incredibly painful. It still is fairly bad but it's steadily healing and I should be okay in a few more weeks. Regardless I was sitting in bed on my laptop and my wife told me that she saw a car outside. Guess who showed up to my home? I have literally no idea how he obtained my address but regardless here he was, storming up to my door. He began to bang on the door over and over yelling my name telling me to come outside with a number of other expletives thrown in there. Now I wasn't in much of a position to stand easily and I told my wife not to open the door and call the police. I ended up in an extremely lucky situation here as my neighbor, we'll call him Mike was outside and noticed the commotion. At this point Jim was kicking at the door, essentially attempting to kick it in. Mike ran over and they got into a verbal confrontation just before the police arrived. Jim ended up getting arrested, the police took everyones account of the situation and it even looks like he will be charged for the original assaults. Haven't heard much about it since then, I'm just excited to move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did talk to a lawyer and they are pursuing legal action against the company at this time, I can't say too much about that right now but it looks like it's in my favor.""",I was assaulted by our System Administrator [Update],0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/mnjkx5/i_was_assaulted_by_our_system_administrator_update/,2021-04-09 15:23:51,April,2021

We were forced to come back even with Covid restrictions not lifted in the state I reside in. People don't seem to want to be here. I work as a Desktop Support Analyst Tier 2 with 2 tier 1 techs below me. We had a peculiar issue today, something that wasn't in our documentation that got escalated to me and then I escalated it to the proper support team(That the sys admin, we'll call him Jim, was in).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot even 20 minutes passed before Jim came storming into our room, we have a weird office with the three of us in it, yelling at one of the tier 1s that they didn't list the documentation number correctly and it makes his job impossible. I apologized, told the tier 1 not to worry and that we would make a note and make sure to fix it for next time. I asked him what number he preferred to be added and he spit on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I get that this sounds like a rapid escalation but he has previously shown disdain to our team and I don't understand why. I am an extremely professional person who does not like to be involved in company politics and I'm fairly introverted so I keep to myself and do my work. I did swear when he spit on me, but nothing offensive to him. I mean it's Covid! You can't just walk around spitting on people. Apparently the swearing set him off and he was looking for a fight since he pushed me. My tier one that he had yelled at stood up and told him to stop and Jim spit on him. I got between them telling Jim to get out of the office, at this point I did put my hands on him and he punched me in the face.

Filed a police report and contacting lawyers in my area. Got away with a cracked rib too it appears.

Team503,1621636929,,,371,ni4vnm,1495,ITCareerQuestions,"""Here's a few things I posted in response to a question from someone who wanted to get into IT at 26 without any experience.  It's oriented towards people who want to be in infrastructure IT - sysadmins, DBAs, networks engineers, and so on.\n\n* **CERTS ARE NICE BUT NOT MANDATORY,** unless you're trying to be an SME. I view them more as something to differentiate you from similar candidates (it tells me you're willing to commit to the time, cost, and effort of passing to enhance your career, the same thing that a bachelor's tells me on a smaller scale)\n* **WORK FOR AN MSP** for a couple of years; it sucks, they're a grind, but you'll be exposed to most segments of the industry, deal with environments from small to large, and get your feet under you. In my generation this was call centers, but now its MSPs.  I tend to treat years of experience at a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio when they're at an MSP (e.g., if you work two years at an MSP, I consider that the same experience as working 4-6 years at a traditional corporate IT job).\n* Additionally, MSP jobs let you touch a lot of stuff, meaning you get to try doing stuff and see whether you actually like it. This is very useful - infosec sounds great, but you might actually HATE it (it's very detail oriented, reading piles of log files, and the like - I find it boring as hell).\n* **GET A FRICKIN DEGREE**.  If you don't have an undergraduate degree (college degree), get back in school and get one. The IT industry is increasingly interested in degrees. Personally, I don't care if you have one or not when I'm hiring, but some companies won't touch you if you don't. It's VERY, VERY hard to get into management especially at the Director level or above without a degree.\n* **BUILD AND USE A HOMELAB.** Build one and maintain it (I still have mine and use it regularly), and make sure to bring it up during interviews. Tell me about challenges you had with it, what it taught you, etc. If I ask you about your experience with hosted web sites, and you have no professional experience there, you can say \""I set up and maintain a requests website for my Plex at home, I have 45 users, and it's fully encrypted with SSL and blah blah blah).\"" Especially in lower level roles, it's a HUGE plus.\n* **SELL YOURSELF**. When you're just starting, you don't have much experience and education isn't very impactful. Sell me on your drive to learn, sell me on your intelligence, sell me on your willingness to work hard to earn your place.\n* On that same vein, **ASK QUESTIONS IN THE INTERVIEW**. Ask about the company, ask about the team, ask about the people on it. Do your due diligence - look me up on LinkedIn if I'm the interviewer, look up the company, be familiar with what we do and what's been happening with us. Show me you care enough about the environment you're going to be in to do the research, and I'm VASTLY more inclined to hire you.\n* **APPLY ANYWAY**. Even if you don't meet the requirements - most of my job reqs have to get filtered through HR and their idiocy, and people like to add buzzwords and other ridiculousness by the time they're posted. On top of that, I probably gave them a wish list of ten things and they listed all ten things as mandatory - if you can check off two or three boxes on that list, you're probably sufficiently skilled to do the role.\n* **YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO KNOW EVERYTHING**. I expect people to have to learn new things in every role they take, no matter what level they are. For instance, my current role uses a lot of Hyper-V (dammit I hate it) and every other shop I've ever worked in or run has used VMware for virtualization. It wasn't a barrier for hiring - I simply told the interviewing manager \""My experience is in VMware, but the principles and concepts are all the same. I'll start brushing up on my Hyper-V before my start date.\""\n* **THE TEAM FIT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING ELSE**. How you interact with me and my team members is VERY important to me. I'd rather have a good fit I have to train you up a bit than deal with someone who's difficult to interact with. Remember that you spend more time with your coworkers than you do with your SPOUSE, and take jobs accordingly. Spend time chatting about hobbies and interests when interviewing, don't hesitate to outright tell them you want to make sure you're a good fit on the team (it would impress me, even at a fairly senior level, if a candidate told me that)\n* **IF YOU DON'T KNOW, DON'T LIE**.  I'll see through your lie in half a second - when interviewing, admit your ignorance.  \""I'm not familiar with THIS TECH, but it sounds like OTHER TECH and I'd approach that issue this way.\""\n* **NOT ALL MONEY IS GOOD MONEY**. Some place may pay more, but they may also work you 90 hours a week on the regular and micromanage the fuck out of you. Factor work/life balance, your culture fit, growth potential, and everything else (benefits, PTO, etc) as much as you value money.\n* **IF YOU STAY OUT OF MANAGEMENT, THE SKY IS THE LIMIT.** You can go all the way. My brother is a pretty big deal with Dell's infosec team, and he had minimal IT experience when he got started (like less than 5 years total) and he makes more than I do now. The only reason this isn't true in management is that not having a degree will be a large challenge, and these days, C-level positions almost *require* an MBA. $100k plus salaries are achievable within ten years of starting from scratch, if you make smart choices and work your ass off.\n* **LINKEDIN IS YOUR FRIEND.**  Keep your LinkedIn up to date and accurate.\n* **LEARN CLOUD.**  Your town is either an AWS town or an Azure town; figure out which and learn it.  FYI, Dallas is an Azure town.  This idea is based on the concept that certain places are strong in certain industries, and certain industries have a strong preference for a particular cloud provider.  Obviously, there will be plenty of exceptions.\n* **RESUMES LIST ACCOMPLISHMENTS NOT DUTIES**.  How did you benefit the company?  What was the EFFECT of your change?  Did you improve your team's customer satisfaction rating at the call center?  Did you implement centralized logging and reduce time spent viewing log files 40%?  Did you make an architecture change an improve uptime from three nines to five?  Did you save the company money?  Your title tells me what you did.  I want to know what you \\*accomplished\\*.\n* **SOFT SKILLS ARE HUGE**.  People with technical skills are a dime a dozen, but tech people with PEOPLE skills are surprisingly rare.\n* **DRESS FOR THE JOB YOU WANT NOT THE JOB YOU HAVE**.  Self-explanatory, and remember that more 'important' doesn't necessarily mean more formal.  It doesn't.  Pay attention to how your leaders and peers dress and dress appropriately.\n\nI'm sure there's more, but this is what I thought up.\n\n**EDIT:** What an incredible response!  Thanks everyone!  I'll be passing this around to some colleagues and making a better list and I'll repost it in a month or so.\n\nAlso, some definitions:\n\n**MSP is managed service provider**.  It's a company that provides IT services to other companies.  Rosie's Florist Shops may make decent money and have three stores, but they can't afford to hired a skilled sysadmin, DBA, and network engineer to maintain their infrastructure, much less to create and maintain a website for them.  Instead of blowing money, they hire a company that has all those people at hand to do it for them on an ongoing basis.  Some bill per hour, some bill a flat rate, some do a bit of both.  Your MSP does everything from helpdesk and desktop support to planning, implementing, and maintaining your network and systems infrastructure for you.\n\n**SME means subject matter expert**.  They're highly specialized and focus their entire career on one tech stack.  They are generally only hired by consulting firms and large companies. My current role wouldn't hire an SME, but my last role had lots. That company is a billion dollar tech company with dedicated teams for MS Engineers, Linux Engineers, VMware engineers, storage engineers, etc.\n\nThey had an open spot for an SME last I looked - they needed an expert in Microsoft Systems Center (or whatever they're calling it this week). It's relatively rare skillset, because SCCM is chewy as fuck, expensive to license, and difficult to implement or maintain, but amazing when it's done right. They had a huge environment and needed someone who's entire job was to deal with SCCM.   \n  That position had been open for over a year and they STILL couldn't find one. Last I heard, they still hadn't. That's an SME.""",General advice from a hiring manager and 23 year industry veteran to newbies,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ni4vnm/general_advice_from_a_hiring_manager_and_23_year/,2021-05-21 22:42:09,May,2021

I had to move for this job offer, though I had multiple offers across the USA.\n\n\nI\u2019ve had offers from Minneapolis for 72k, Austin for 74k, Tulsa for 65k, and accepted a job offer in Raleigh for 70k.\n\n\nBefore we go any further, if you are not in a \u201ctech\u201d area and want to accomplish this, plan to move.\n\n\nAnyways, how did I do it? I started off studying what industry I wanted to be in and what\u2019s popular. It ended up being the \u201ccloud\u201d. The good thing? It pays a lot, even if your new. The bad? It can be hard to get hired as a noob in the IT world starting at the cloud...UNLESS you take the correct steps.\n\n\nStep 1: Prove my knowledge in various ways. How did I do this? First thing I did was self study and grab 3 certifications.\n\n1. AWS Solutions Architect Associate\n2. AWS SysOps Administrator Associate \n3. AWS Certified Developer Associate \n\n\nIt took me 87 days to get all 3 of these certifications. After that, I needed to prove my knowledge in a real world way since I knocked the paper certifications out of the way. \n\n\nI did 2 Cloud AWS projects, one was a chat bot integrated into Facebook messenger that has automatic responses I built using Amazon Lex.\n\nThe second project was more on the infrastructure side of things.\n\nBoth were pretty simple projects for the most part.\n\n\nStep 2: Establish credibility. I started a YouTube channel where I created AWS Cloud tutorials and even showed how to do some things like building the chat bot, hosting websites using s3, explaining what route53 is and the differences between all the options, etc. \n\n\nAfter this, I grabbed 1 more certification. I went ahead and passed the CompTIA Security+ certification so I could open the door to government jobs, though I didn\u2019t end up at a government job. It only took 11 days, so it wasn\u2019t too big of a deal.\n\n\nAfter this I created a resume using one of the top formats posted on Reddit and updated all my LinkedIn information. I turned my status to searching for opportunities and started reaching out to recruiters and applying to jobs in cities across the United States. \n\n\nFor specific areas I loved, I created a phone number using that area code and used it on that resume. At one point, I had 5 identical resumes but with different telephone numbers and used each one according to the city I was applying to.\n\n\nAfter doing this, I started getting job offers. This path is much much better than help desk and can slingshot you forward in your career. I had no connections in this industry, no prior experience, and no college degree. \n\n\nLike I said, I received multiple offers, it\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s possible.\n\n\nLook for jobs titled:\nJr devops\nDevOps 1\nAWS Engineer\nCloud Support Engineer\nHell, I even got an SOC analyst offer in the cyber security space.\n\n\nStudy materials:\nFor the AWS certs I used LinuxAcademy and aCloudGuru, as well as reading white papers.\n\n\nFor CompTIA Security+ I used professor messers YouTube video series and also bought a cheap study guide to supplement it.""",How I went from $14hr to 70k with no experience,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bhfegj/how_i_went_from_14hr_to_70k_with_no_experience/,2019-04-25 23:25:32,April,2019

If you like doing this, then cool, this thread isn\u2019t for you.\n\nI\u2019m an engineer at a Big N (not Amazon), and wanted to dive off into a quick side bar. I started working here when I was 21.

When do we as people stop worrying about promotions, and spending time with family, and try to do meaningful things that matter? Why does it feel like time is flying by so excruciatingly fast?

Boggle-Crunch,1615143503,,,244,lzx2su,1180,ITCareerQuestions,"""You might think this is common knowledge. You might have clicked on this and thought to yourself \""well this is stupid, why is he asking this?\"". And you'd be 100% right, it *is* stupid. And thank fuck you have the cognizance to recognize that being an asshole is generally regarded as a bad career choice. But I've now dealt with the fourth personnel-related instance of an IT professional being inexcusably rude, callous, or outright confrontational in the last several months. IT has a particular seems to have a problem with asshole senior members, and if I want to impart any wisdom to people entering the industry, it's this:\n\n**At no point will being an asshole benefit you. At all. Soft skills are singlehandedly more valuable than any technical skill will ever be, and if you think being the grumpy IT guy that no one wants to deal with will somehow benefit you or your career, then I hope you enjoy being paid 40k a year for the rest of your life.**\n\nSo, let's get into why I'm saying this. A little background on me: I've been pentesting for about 10 years now and manage a Red Team for a very, very large and public company. I'm involved in a lot of hiring efforts across our org's technical departments and mentorship efforts.\n\nWe're hiring for a new network engineer, and we had two candidates we had narrowed it down to. One candidate was extremely qualified, to the point of amazement from our tech-aligned C-Suite. But when we held our interview with him, it was far and away the worst performance I've ever seen in my life by a herculean margin. We had asked him what he would do in assisting a non-IT person with an IT problem, and his response was, and I quote:\n\n>\""Nothing. I'm not a fucking babysitter. They can figure it out themselves.\""\n\nWhen we asked him how he would respond to a specific problem related to.\n\n>\""Tell them they're a moron. I don't really give a shit about how they feel, if they can't get the job done then I'll make it clear they don't deserve to be in it.\""\n\nAnd finally, when we said that that would ruffle a lot of feathers, he simply shrugged.\n\n>\""Not really my problem. This is a company, and I'm here to do a job.\""\n\nIt amazed me that this man got hired for any positions at all, let alone 20 years worth. Needless to say, we ended the interview immediately, and sent him a rejection email within the hour. There is absolutely no world in which these are the correct answers to any sort of interview question you'll get.\n\n**As a Senior member of any team, it is** ***always*** **your obligation to assist and teach those less experienced than you.**\n\nA week later, I sat in on an interview for a help desk position. It was well separated from what I was usually involved in, but I was helping out one of the team leads with interviewing, as they were relatively new to it.\n\nDuring the interview, one of the steps for the candidate is to replicate a series of calls from \""employees\"" (other IT leads) to gauge how effectively the candidate can walk through basic troubleshooting steps. We don't especially care for technical prowess, that can be taught, but this part is to see entirely how effective they are at working with other people.\n\nOne of the call scenarios involved a lady who couldn't get her internet working and was minimally technically inclined, more designed to test soft skills than anything else. But it was clear that the candidate was getting very frustrated very quickly. The call was going incredibly long, and we usually try to cap it at 15 minutes. At one point, the \""caller\"" said:\n\n>\""I don't really know what's going on here...I'm sorry, but can you just get your manager for me?\""\n\nAfter a few seconds, he exploded.\n\n>\""Look bi--\""\n\nHe caught himself and the rest of the team leads sat in silence on the other end of the call. After several seconds of silence, he slammed his desk with his fist.\n\n>\""Look, I don't know what to tell ya, if you don't know how to use Google then you should probably find another job lady. Anything else?\""\n\nThis is so outstandingly not how you get a job. I don't know where this kid learned his interview skills but it's clear it wasn't from any practical experience. Don't be like this.\n\n**Do not, under any circumstances, take your frustration out on anyone in the work place, especially someone for whom** ***it is your literal job to help them.*** **You'll find many cases wherein you'll work with non-IT people. It's your job to know IT, not theirs, and knowing how to teach someone is one of the most valuable skills you'll learn in your entire career.**\n\nA few weeks ago, we had an incident our blue team was addressing. We had just hired a new kid to train into incident response as a junior member, and he was training under one of the senior members. Being Red Team, I don't get especially involved in IR efforts, but on a whim I decided to check in and see how things were going. I then had to listen to this new kid literally cry to me because the senior member had cheweed him out for not knowing extremely advanced digital forensics concepts. He sent me some of the chat logs between him and the senior member, and I was amazed that this kid didn't quit on the spot. Some of them included:\n\n>\""You have the CISSP! How do you not know how to dump the RAM of an infected machine? Are you serious?\""  \n>  \n>\""This is a waste of my time.\""  \n>  \n>\""It's amazing that you got hired.\""\n\nAside from the fact that the CISSP has next to nothing to do with the nitty-gritty of digital forensics, the fact that a seniormost member had this kind of behavior towards a junior he was explicitly told to train, it astounded me that this happened at all. I told the new kid we would go to HR together and make sure this was resolved. I can't even begin to describe how much I cannot stand this kind of behavior in the workplace. If you're a grown-ass adult, you have no excuse to behave like this to a junior member at all, especially one you were specifically instructed to take under your wing and build up into a senior member.\n\nAs this particular senior member was not under my jurisdiction, I was in no position to be telling him off for his behavior. But I had a very strong conversation with his team lead about the kind of behaviors he was fostering on his team. Thankfully, HR had already given him a heads up on what happened. Behaviors like this are cultivated from the top down, and at no point should you ever make someone's job more difficult because of your ego. Yes, there are going to be hard days, but that is absolutely no reason to take your anger and frustration out on anyone in the workplace. Absolutely no exceptions.\n\n**As you grow in your respective industry, it will be incredibly easy for you to forget what it was like to be a beginner, and to assume that what you know is baseline knowledge in your industry. The more you keep this in mind, the more it will make working with your colleges and subordinates significantly more positive. A little empathy can go a very, very long way.**\n\n**tl;dr: Don't be an asshole.**""","I can't believe I have to say this: Being the ""asshole IT guy"" isn't nearly the steadfast character trait you think it is.",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/lzx2su/i_cant_believe_i_have_to_say_this_being_the/,2021-03-07 18:58:23,March,2021

TheAspiringGoat,1573410378,,,62,duf4wy,935,ITCareerQuestions,"""**Foreword:** I've seen many posts on this thread regarding how to start or skill-up in this industry, and I thought I'd share my two cents on ways to do so. I've divided this post into three sections: Foundational Tier, Advanced Tier, and Expert Tier. If you already have knowledge from a previous tier, start at the tier after. After discussing the tiers and what knowledge to obtain, I\u2019ll have a bonus \u201cextra tips\u201d section that will discuss resumes, websites for learning tech, and job hunting.\n\n**Disclaimer before I begin:** This is just my opinion on how to get started or skill-up in this industry. I'm obsessed with IT hiring/job data, and I scour several job sites and look at financial salary reports based on what skills are in high demand, and I read a lot of job posts. Just to give you a sense of where I'm at in my own career at the moment, I'm currently a Sys Admin in the fin-tech industry. Sites I analyze data/job posts from: Dice, Robert Half, Indeed, Linkedin, Glassdoor, Zip Recruiter, Medium, and select subreddits pertaining to IT/Tech.\n\n**Foundational Tier:** For those just starting their IT career journey, this is where you start. A good way I like to gain new knowledge is to study for specific certifications, so I\u2019ll be recommending certs to study for as we go. You don\u2019t necessarily need to obtain the certs, but having them on your resume will make it look good and with certain certs demonstrate practical knowledge.\n\n* If you\u2019re completely new to computer hardware/software/IT, I recommend glancing over an A+ certification study guide, it will teach you the basics of hardware and desktop/laptop/printer administration.\n* Two skills I recommend every IT professional to have it **Networking** and **Linux**. As a bonus, many companies also have Windows Server operating systems, so studying for the **MCSA Server 2016 (or relevant Azure cert)** certification wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea.\n   * For networking knowledge, study for the **Network+ or CCNA** certifications. Net+ is more beginner friendly, and CCNA goes into more depth and focuses on Cisco specific networking equipment (you can also choose a Juniper cert as well, because it\u2019s a popular networking equipment vendor too).\n   * For Linux knowledge, study for the **Linux+, LPIC-1, or RHCSA** certs (I recommend RHCSA because the exam is performance based and it will show employers that you have hands-on experience with Red Hat Linux).\n* **Update:** The **Google IT Support** Course path on Coursera is a great set of courses that teaches a broad range of systems administration, linux, and security, check it out!\n\n**Advanced Tier:** For the Advanced Tier we\u2019re going to focus on programmatic/command line skills. Here are four items that are super good to learn, and if you have knowledge in these areas you will open up your career opportunities: **Python, Powershell, Bash, SQL/Databases**. Now I advise you pick two of these and get good at them, but if you want to be super cool learn a little about all of them. \\*\\* As a bonus for the Advanced Tier, I recommend learning some **Configuration Management**. Configuration Management options include: **Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Salt Stack.**\n\n* **Python** is a programming language, but can also be used by system administrators as a scripting languages to automate manual tasks. For learning Python there are tons of resources, but a good one I\u2019ve found is a book/Udemy course called: **\u201cAutomate The Boring Stuff With Python\u201d**. There\u2019s a website for it where you can read the book for free online, you can buy the paperback version, and there\u2019s a cheap Udemy course that follows along with the book as well.\n   * **Update:** Google has come out with a new course path on Coursera called: **IT Automation W/Python**, I enrolled in it right now and it's really good!\n* **PowerShell** is the windows command line on steroids, and learning it will make people think you\u2019re a wizard on any Windows computer/server. A good way to learn PowerShell is the **\u201cLearn Powershell In A Month Of Lunches\u201d** book.\n* **Bash** is the command line equivalent of the Linux/Unix world. Bash is used to give Linux commands and to use as a scripting language like PowerShell to administer Linux systems. A good resource for learning Bash are books like **\u201cThe Bash CookBook\u201d** or **\u201cLearning Bash\u201d**. Studying for the above mentioned Linux certs will also teach you bash.\n* **SQL** stands for Structured Query Language, and is used to manipulate and gather data from databases. People that know SQL definitely do not have issues finding jobs, so I thought I\u2019d include it on the list. There are several SQL courses on the **Udemy** website that are good for learning SQL and database skills (at the end of this reddit post I will share other sites that are great for IT/Tech learning, so stay tuned). Alternatively, you can study for the **MTA Database Fundamentals** certification. **Edit:** It's been pointed out in the comments that another great resource for learning SQL are the **T-SQL Fundamentals and T-SQL querying books by Itzik Ben-Gan**.\n* For learning **Configuration Management**, **Linux Academy** has videos that cover these pieces of software. You get a free trial when you sign up with them, plus they have videos in a \u201cfree tier\u201d that cover the basics of a variety of different topics.\n* **Edit - Security:** Someone brought up the fact that I left out information security, so I will add a bit about that. The **Security+** cert is a good place to start with security, as is working with **SELinux**. After the basics of the Security+ there are a plethora of certs that teach more advanced security knowledge, companies such as **ISACA, SANS, ISC2, and CompTia** (to less of an extend than the formers but still worth mentioning) offer such certs. Information Security practices are also taught in specialty certs for many of the Orgs listed in this post such as Cisco, Aws, Azure, etc (Example: AWS Security Specialty).\n* For additional coding/programming knowledge, you can visit the following sites: FreeCodeCamp, Codeacademy, TeamTreeHouse, TheOdinProject\n\n**Expert Tier:** For the Expert Tier I\u2019m going to recommend Cloud, and Containerization technology. The Tech world is heavily shifting to use these two awesome technologies, and knowing them will get you some pretty awesome and unique jobs.\n\n* For **Cloud** knowledge, you\u2019ll want to pick one of the three big providers **(AWS/Azure/Google Cloud)**, and study for their certs. AWS has the **Solutions Architect/Developer/SysOps** certs (or the **Cloud Practitioner** at the very beginner level), Google has its **Associate Cloud Engineer** cert, and Azure has certs as well but their names escape me.\n* **Containers** are really super cool. There\u2019s a few big players in this arena: Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift (this one is for Red Hat Linux). Docker has the **DCA** cert you can study for, Kubernetes has the **CKA** cert (they have a developer cert as well), and OpenShift has specific Red Hat certs hat cover its material.\n\n**Extra Tips/Info**\n\n**Websites with good learning resources**:\n\n* **Free:** Youtube, EdX, Coursera, Udacity (some), Udemy (some)\n* **Pay for:** Udemy, Linux Academy, ACloudGuru, Linkedin Learning, PluralSight\n\n**Resume:** Make sure your resume is spiffy and shows off all of your talents. Make sure it markets you in a great way. Get the help of a resume professional if you have to. Once that is done make sure you make a profile (make it look nice and spiffy) on big job sites **(LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Dice, Indeed)** and post your resume on all of them.\n\n**Labbing:** This is a huge one. Practicing new technologies/software at home is a great way to level up your skills and show employers you have the drive to learn new things and become better. You can do this in two ways:\n\n* **Physical machines:** You can buy new or get old/junker computers/servers and put Linux and other operating systems on them, network them together, and use this setup to practice system administration skills.\n* **Virtual Labbing:** Or you can use software like **Virtual Box/VMWare** to create virtual servers and practice system administration that way.\n* **Cloud Labbing:** Same as above, but making virtual machines and entire enterprise environments in the cloud. When you sign up for an account with any of the big cloud providers, they give you introductory credit to experiment with the cloud and understand how it works.\n\n**Location Matters:** When hunting for IT/Tech jobs, location matters. Remote jobs are possible, but good ones can be hard to find. If you\u2019re in a small/rural city, I recommend looking for jobs near bigger cities/capital cities/tech hubs. **Indeed and Glassdoor** are great websites to scope out jobs in other cities, and see how salaries are in those cities. Now I know that not everyone is in a situation to move, but I will tell you that it\u2019s worth it. I lived in a small southern town, moved to a capital city for work, and it was amazing. Perhaps I\u2019m biased because I made the move and it turned out good for me, but I recommend considering moving if you\u2019re in an area that does not have a good tech market.\n\n**Edit Feb, 2020** Time for some updates! Google came out with am amazing course path on coursera, on how to do IT automation with python, so I'm adding that to the list. I'm also adding the Google IT Support course path to the beginner tier.\n\n**Edit May 2022** I've since made another post similar to this one, check it out here: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/szrxz6/my_advice_on_how_to_level_up_your_it_career_cloud/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share""",Want to start/level-up your IT career?

The program at my school was really weak and it was difficult for me to get hired at jobs right out of school.\n\n  \n\u00a0I was decent at writing and got hired to write for an online publication but the pay was very low and the job prospects in the field we're pretty weak.\u00a0 The online publication was related to technology and it gave me an interest in software cloud computing and other cool things that were happening in the world that I wanted to explore further.\n\n  \n\u00a0During the pandemic I had been laid off.\u00a0 I had been reading about CompTIA and other IT certificates to get into the field and I decided to take the A+.\u00a0\n\n  \nI spent basically all my free time watching Professor Messer videos and also doing as many technical tasks.\n\n  \nI started off by setting up my emails on my phone or setting up Zoom calls for my family members during Thanksgiving.\u00a0 I would go to Micro Center and buy computer parts and try to build my own PC and then take it apart so I knew how it all worked. \u00a0I would put Windows on a flash drive and learn how to boot up the OS myself.\n\n  \n\u00a0I took free online classes on coding that really helped me stand out during my interviews.\u00a0 I don't code at all during my job but for whatever reason people seemed impressed when they know that you can code.\n\nThese were simple things but I felt much more prepared and technical after doing them.\n\n  \n\u00a0After I passed the A+  I started applying to jobs on indeed.\u00a0 Within a few weeks I landed an interview for a Help Desk position and it was very basic I was able to answer most of the questions as they related to my A+ studies and some had been from the simple technical tasks I was doing.\n\n  \n\u00a0I landed a job as a level one technician making $40,000 a year.\u00a0 The work was hard and low paying but I did have an income and I was grateful for that.\u00a0 In my free time I tried to learn as much as I could on the job I also started working on the Security Plus certificate after I passed this I was able to start taking on some cybersecurity work at my company and got a slight pay bump to $45,000 a year.\n\n  \nAt some point I felt that I learned everything I could at my help desk job and I couldn't progress any further. I started applying to as many jobs as I could for better paying positions. This job search was much more difficult than the first one it took me almost 6 months.\u00a0 I finally landed an offer for a junior systems administrator position that paid $85,000 a year.\n\n  \n\u00a0I was ecstatic as my goal salary I was shooting for was $65,000. The job that I got was in a major urban center so the salary was very high. The downside is that I have a very long commute almost 3 hours a day.\n\n# My advice:\n\n* Don\u2019t sit around and wait for the perfect job to come to you. If you're not hearing back from entry level jobs keep applying but also look into other areas. Explore your local tutoring center and see if you can teach kids to code. Check out Geek Squad at best buy or your local PC repair shop. Also look at customer service jobs. Many of the customer service skills you will learn will translate over to your entry-level IT jobs and also your higher level IT jobs were you may be in a lot of meetings with people.\n* Create a list of technical exercises to work on in your free time and take as many free online courses as possible. There are now free online IT certificates from Microsoft and Google you can work on. This will help you build up that sense of familiarity with technology.\u00a0\n* Reflect on how far you've come not how far you have left to go. There are some really technical people at my company and it's kind of crazy how much they know. When you feel like this just reflect on the progress you've made. Just 2 years ago pinging a server was the most advanced IT task I knew how to do. Now I manage and maintain 50 virtual machines on Azure, handle cloud backups on AWS, and have migrated our company to a new cloud based ticketing system.As you get more advanced I advise signing up for a online program like CBT Nuggets because they will give you access to virtual labs to do more complex IT tasks.\u00a0\n* Set small manageable goals that you can actually achieve. Check out the SMART goal setting framework. \n* Set aside one day a week to just chill. You don't always want to be learning and hustling to get ahead. Hang out with friends, watch movies, or spend time in nature on this day.\n\n  \nI will be staying around to advise people in r/CompTIA, r/GetAJobInIT, and r/ITCareerQuestions so feel free to ask me for advice.""",I entered the IT field unemployed and with no experience. 2 years later I'm making $85K.

Dry_Competition_684,1677184190,,,93,11a7um0,882,ITCareerQuestions,"""I remember it pretty well, like it was yesterday. Browsing this subreddit wondering, how to break into IT. I wanted to write this up for all you guys doing the same thing. You are wondering how long it will take, how long until you make X amount of money. What certs you need, etc. Everyone's story will be different. I am 1000% confident there are people much smarter than myself who aren't making this money, or it took them longer than five years. A lot of it is timing, lucky breaks, etc. This is just the story of how I prepared myself to take advantage of my lucky breaks. You can do it too. It might take you ten years. You might do it in 3 years. Life is random, but you can control you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was stuck a retail sales job I hated. But I was making 60k per year with no degree, so I felt hopelessly stuck. Money was the best I could hope for, for someone with my skillset and qualifications. I was interviewing for assistant store manager jobs in the company at the time and kept getting rejected. This sales job also happened to be a for a major cellular provider so I started to realize I was very good at troubleshooting phones, apps, etc. I also developed very good people skills due to the nature of sales. This was my foundation. I had a very close relative that worked in IT, who threw the ladder down to me so to speak. They encouraged me to get certifications and get started on a helpdesk at some point. \""Pay my dues on the help desk for around a year.\"" he would tell me. I would frequently dream about getting out retail and working in IT. I was very good at troubleshooting these mobile phones, and I was discovering I was a nerd who was good with people. I ended up building a computer and that made a light bulb really click with myself. The first time it booted I felt like a caveman who made fire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne day in the summer/fall of 2017 I had a customer come in. I was very professional and kind. As we talked about life, it turned out they were the Senior director for HR at a very large nationally recognized company with a HQ in our town. Several times I saw they posted help desk jobs, but I never was brave enough to apply. I didn't have the experience. I mentioned that to her. She immediately encouraged me to apply and said I'm positive they could use someone like you on the helpdesk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI interviewed with three managers and was hired shortly after. My income dropped from 60k down to 37k, but I knew it wasn't forever either. My work life balance improved dramatically as well. I had escaped retail hell. I busted my ass on the help desk. It was a combo of being thankful to have the opportunity, but also wanting to learn as much as I could. While other co-workers griped and complained about endless BS we dealt with (which we did deal with BS for sure) I just kept grinding.  I obtained my A+, Net+, Sec+ and CCNA R&S while working there for a year and some change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn late 2018 early 2019 I started working at an ISP, because of my newfound CCNA knowledge and networking skills I acquired. I was making about 47k. The job was a nightmare, the company was a shitshow and completely unstable. In spring of 2019 I knew I needed to bail for my family and my own sanity. I was desperately applying to any and everything I could and hearing nothing back even from lesser helpdesk jobs. One night I scrolled past a job posting for a job with an Engineer level title. I looked at it, they were asking for tons of Windows Server experience, experience with Linux and Red hat, and some other things I didn't have much experience with. I initially closed the page and kept moving. I then remembered how much I hated my current job. I went back and threw in a Hail Mary application.\n\nSure, enough I got the job. Nobody matches everything on all job postings. But what I had were fundamental networking skills. This job was basically a solo IT person for a region of a pretty large privately owned company. They needed a blend of people skills and tech skill. I had a main campus that was mine, and multiple industrial locations as well. The pay was in the range of 50-70k depending on how you looked at it and went up over time. This was the best mid-level job I could have asked for. The experience I got was insane. Sure, there was lots of end user BS being the only IT person around. But everything was mine. I was basically cut loose to make things happen. When we had new locations to bring online. I designed, ordered, configured, installed the networks. When we would change firewall vendors, I would handle that as well. Anything you could think of. I got my hands on. Occasionally I'd have to reach out to some senior guys elsewhere in the country for help. But my region was mine, and it was up to me to keep business operations going especially on the network side and maintaining the hardware and servers that ran our critical applications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI became very comfortable realizing I don't know a lot of shit. Imposter syndrome is a normal feeling for me. What I do know, is that if you understand networking, know the OSI model, and can google stuff well. There's really not a ton of stuff you can't figure out. Nobody remembers or knows everything in every area of IT. It's about fundamental skills that allow you to understand new technology quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember my close relative from earlier? Well, they had their CISSP for several years, and I watched their income basically go parabolic since that point. So, I made that my next step. I had just over five years in IT and my roles all along the way had at least two of the domains covered the entire five years. So, I obtained my CISSP certification in January of 2023. The CISSP ***DID NOT make me a cyber security guru***. It changed my thinking from tech first, to business first. I think about risk and business impact first and foremost at this point. This is extremely valuable to the market. Tech is cool and all but companies want to make money. If they don't, you don't have a job. If you can speak that language, they will want to hire you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently accepted a position making north of 130k annually for a very large corporation in network security. The whole thing doesn't feel real to me, and just like everyone else my inner imposter is still there. But once again, I'm just going to keep busting my ass and embracing what I don't know, so I can grow even more skills. This isn't a brag. Trust me I'm just a dude, who is quite unimpressive. If I can do it, anyone can do it.

It's not an expensive city to live in, but it isn't dirt cheap, either.\n\n**Very Big Company 1** - Helpdesk ~30k USD, 3 Months\n\nWhat I got right: Transitioned into a new career by leveraging a contracting company.  Worked like a dog to impress higher ups.  Always took the initiative, especially to learn.\n\nWhat I did wrong: It could've easily not worked.  Luck played a really big part.\n\nHow I got lucky: I got noticed and moved to deskside support almost immediately.  I won't deny how lucky this was.  I'm not going to downplay my part in this, though; if I had not been on the ball, I would not have been moved up.  I just recognize that I got lucky here.\n\n**Very Big Company 1** - Deskside Support ~40-50k USD, 2.5 Years\n\nWhat I got right: Worked hard, learned a lot.  After a slump a year in, got back on and continued learning.  For the last year, pressured my team lead into allowing me to work evenings, used quiet hours to learn Powershell, Python, C#.\n\nWhat I did wrong: Stayed for waaaaaay too long.  I was still a contractor at Very Big Company 1 after nearly 3 years, hoping to get hired on.  Don't rely on verbal promises, folks.  Don't be like me here.  I should've stopped contract work after a year and found a full time position.  I didn't realize the scope of IT and how far down the ladder I was.\n\nHow I got lucky: Dodged a few toxic coworkers, for the most part.\n\n**Midsize Company 1** - Deskside Support ~60-65k USD, 1 Year\n\nWhat I got right: Started trying to automate everything using scripting and programming skills learned from personal study time.  That's where everything changed.  I completed well over 5x the work of my coworkers in this environment, immediately bringing me into the spotlight for higher-ups.  Volunteered for a big job that was well out of my pay grade, immediately followed up with superiors about how this meant I deserved a promotion.\n\nWhat I did wrong: I was pretty patient and probably could've achieved the next promotion sooner by being more aggressive.  It could also be argued that working a project well above my pay grade could've led to me being taken advantage of.  I'm not sure if I would change that if I could do it over again, though.  I learned a lot, and it ended up paying off.\n\nHow I got lucky: Manager was great, company recognized talent and promoted from within.  I could've gotten used, instead I got promoted.  I also was placed in an environment that desperately needed automation, so my skills were perfectly timed.\n\n**Midsize Company 1** - Systems Engineer ~100k USD, 1 Year\n\nWhat I got right: Didn't stop automating and learning.  Grabbed projects and worked hard to become an expert at the systems I owned.  Put myself in a cupcake situation by setting up working systems and thinking toward the future.  Started working from home full time.\n\nWhat I did wrong: I wasn't a hawk for my own benefit.  I was seeing stars from the 100k number, so I didn't realize that I was actually getting underpaid compared to others who did the same job.  (Previous guy in my position was sitting on 125 with just as much experience)\n\nHow I got lucky: Coworkers and company loved me.  Never ended up on-call, never ended up getting trapped in office politics.\n\n**Midsize Company 2** - Sr. Systems Engineer ~125-135k USD, 1 Year\n\nWhat I got right: Recognized my worth and started becoming a hawk for my own benefit.  Started negotiating salary.  Put up a working Github that highlighted my skills, updated LinkedIn with current resume and skills.  Stayed working from home, despite slightly better offers from other companies who were in office.\n\nWhat I did wrong: Still kind of went the safe route, following a previous manager.  He knew how much I made at Midsize Company 1, so he knew a 'reasonable' amount to pay me.  This probably cut my potential pay by 5-10k.\n\nHow I got lucky: Still no on-call, little stress, work from home, basically one of the easiest jobs I could imagine, while still being engaging and fairly enjoyable.\n\n**Very Big Company 2** - Sr. Staff Collaboration Tools Engineer ~170k USD, 6 Months (current)\n\nWhat I got right: Kept my ears open and pushed recruiters for higher and higher pay.  Leveraged 2 different recruiters against each other and my previous company to get a better situation.  Demanded no on-call and the ability to work remotely.\n\nWhat I did wrong: May have taken the slightly worse job; the pay was comparable but the benefits were oversold for this job.  Nothing major here, just nitpicking.\n\nHow I got lucky:  2 recruiters came to me at the same time, allowing me to leverage them against each other.  I was also already in a pretty good situation, meaning that I didn't *have* to leave.\n\nHonestly, most of this post could be written off as me getting lucky, but much of luck is what you make it.  Yes, I was noticed when others might not have been noticed, but if I hadn't been killing it, getting noticed wouldn't have helped me at all.  \n\nHopefully this helps someone who feels stuck in a rut like I did a couple years in.

You need to educate yourself one way or another.\u00a0 If you\u2019re thinking \u201cI can\u2019t afford college!\u201d or \u201cCollege isn\u2019t for me.\u201d **Then get your certifications.** They\u2019re not necessarily cheap, but they are affordable and trust me, you\u2019re not going anywhere without one or the other.\n\n\u00a0\nSo where do you start?\n\n\u00a0\nFirst, what do you want to do?\n\u00a0\n\n* Software Development\n\n* Network Engineering\n\n* Cyber Security\n\n* System Administration\u00a0\n\n* DevOps\u00a0\n\n* I.T Consultant\n\n* Programmer\n\n\n\u00a0\nSee, there are tons of different fields that follow \u201ccomputers.\u201d Once you decide on which field you want to go into, you need to educate yourself on the field. Grab your CompTIA A+ Certificate. All that says is you know how computers work. It\u2019s the absolute basics, but it will help you get into a Help Desk/Service Desk position. This position is the starting ground for 98% of the individuals who get into IT. You can\u2019t just jump in as a Sys Admin, even with a degree. While you\u2019re at help desk, LEARN. Please, for the love of God, **LEARN**. When you get a call to fix something, and you can\u2019t figure out how to fix it, so you transfer it to another employee, go back and ask them what they did and *why*. Do not accept the answer \u201cit just works that way.\u201d That is the worst approach. You need to know how to fix it next time and why it broke in the first place. This little knowledge will go a long way for you.\n\u00a0\n\nAlso, while you\u2019re at a help desk position, continue getting your certificates.\u00a0 Want to go into network security? Get yourself your Network+, Security+ and your CCNA/CCNP. Want to go into Hardware and Infrastructure? Get your Server+ and CWNA. Software development? You can get your Microsoft Specialist and OCPJP. You\u2019ll need those certificates to keep moving if you\u2019re not going to go to college. You need to show your employer initiative and that you know more than just the basics. Now I know what you\u2019re thinking\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow do I know what certifications will go towards my career?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nWell, here\u2019s a [PDF](https://certification.comptia.org/docs/default-source/downloadablefiles/it-certification-roadmap.pdf) that shows a general road map of what certifications lead to which careers. Have you noticed that every road on that map starts with a CompTIA A+ certification? That\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you to get. You can skip it if you already have a CCNA or something, but if you\u2019re here and you don\u2019t have any skills, you have to start at the A+. And you\u2019ll learn things you didn\u2019t think you were missing.\n\n\u00a0\nNow I would always advise to continue your education and also have the certifications behind you to really stand out, but college isn\u2019t for everyone. Some people are solo learners, some don\u2019t like tests. Whatever the reason, there are other options.\n\n\u00a0\nNow, here is where we lose everyone\u2026\n\n\u00a0\nYou will not get called back on most, yes **MOST**, of your applications. Anyone here can tell you, most people spend months filling out help desk applications. This field is competitive. Do not be discouraged if you fill out 100 applications and only get 10 call backs. A lot of people feel like they\u2019ll never get called back, but it will happen. It takes time. You have to just keep filling them out. And be okay with walking away if it\u2019s a bad fit. Also know that help desk can be, and most likely will be **STRESSFUL.** You\u2019re not going to just breeze by and relax every day. No, people will call you only when something is wrong. You will be frustrated when things don\u2019t go your way or you can\u2019t figure things out. You will not just be building computers all day. You will deal with people who know nothing about what you do, but blame you for everything.\u00a0 It\u2019s a thankless job. But if you work at it, and keep your head high and work the best you can, you can move up. Only you can make your career successful. Good luck to anyone reading this, I hope everything goes well for you. You got this!\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTl;Dr \u2013 There is none. Read the passage.\n\nEdit: Also **PLEASE DO NOT JOIN THIS FIELD JUST FOR MONEY!!!**\n\u00a0\nIn the IT field you have to continue learning. Every day learn something different. You have to love what you do. This isn't a gig just for the big bucks. You gotta love what you do and keep trying to get better if you want to make that 6 figure salary.""",How do I get into IT with no degree and no experience?,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/baypxo/how_do_i_get_into_it_with_no_degree_and_no/,2019-04-08 20:28:55,April,2019

None,1622053608,,,78,nlnvp3,789,ITCareerQuestions,"""I know that IT nerds aren't always the most confident group of people, but Christ on a cracker some of you need to buck up. If you go into an interview explaining yourself the entire time (why you don't have this cert or 'x' amount of experience) you're probably not getting the job. No one wants to work with someone in constant need of approval. The only managers hiring those types of personalities are either desperate to fill the position or are looking for someone they can control, usually in the form of ridiculous hours.  In these interviews simply state what you know and don't know.  That's it. And if you don't know something, I  want to know HOW you would find the answer, NOT a reason for why you don't know.\n\nThere are so many posts in this sub-reddit asking where you might land job wise based on experience, certs, education, etc. You need to BREAK OUT of this mentality or else you're going to get bottle necked into shittier roles. If you base your ceiling off of mere education and experience, quit doing that NOW. You need to learn to MARKET YOURSELF. Sell your communication skills, customer service experience, work ethic, ambition, troubleshooting finesse, and so on. What can you tell me about yourself that would drive home the idea that you grind on and off the clock, to better yourself as a professional? What can you tell me to prove that you take pride in your work? If you want to be a linux admin do you troubleshoot your own Linux server? If you want to get into cyber security, have you taken the time to spin up Kali and other virtual environments? If you want to be a network engineer, do you have a subscription to Cisco VIRL? What have you built there? I'm sure you get the point.\n\nStop begging for a job and go into your interview with your head held high.  This doesn't mean be an egotistical asshole, but if you're looking for a new job, swing for the fences! Whats the worst that can happen?  Shoot above your experience. If all you have is an A+ and Net+ cert, but you want to be a network administrator or engineer, fuck it! Apply. All they can say is no.  Worst case you never hear back from them, best case you get into an interview.  For years people told me the ONLY way to become a network engineer was by getting a CCNP. Bullshit. They told me I'd have to work 10 years in the industry to get into cyber. Bullshit. They told me I would need AWS certs to get into cloud. Again, bullshit. Once you learn that HR creates bogus job descriptions because they're tech illiterate, you will realize these aren't hard rules, just road maps.\n\nIf you're trying to get into cloud, but are constantly being rejected, maybe its not your resume. Maybe it's your inability to sell yourself.  If I look at someones resume who has minimal experience in IT, but can show in the interview that they're hungry, I'll at least bring them in for a 1st round tech interview. If they suck at the tech interview, but are grinding in their free time doing labs, it shows me consistency. It shows you're trying to be better at this vocation.\n\nHere's a small secret - as hiring managers, we know you're not where you need to be technically, but we still brought you into the interview. We've seen your resume and know that you're trying to fluff things up a bit to make it seem like you know more than you do. It's OK, we've all been there. The question is, can on the job training get you where need to be and HOW MUCH TIME will it take to bring you up to speed? We KNOW you're going to struggle for the first 6 months, but you're cheaper than hiring a senior or more established engineer. What we want to know, is are you going to be willing to figure things out on your own. When you ask for my help, can I be certain you're doing your own due diligence prior to asking? Will you put in the extra hours to get to where you're useful to the team?\n\nFor example, if someone asks you about routing protocols in an interview, you need to put in the time to KNOW THE BASICS. But If you don't know the answer, then tell someone how you would find the answer. Give them the approach to how you would work to drive home a solution that's unknown to you. I've literally been in interviews where a candidate told me how they would use google to search for an answer, down to the wording in the search bar. Nice, I like that! It tells me that you can cover the first step of research instead of hounding me every time you get stuck on an issue. It tells me that you're willing to do the hard stuff.\n\nI speak from experience when I tell you that I've never gone into an interview with all of the qualifications posted for a job, NEVER. Not once have I ever thought to myself that my skills were sufficient for jobs that asked for 5-10 years experience. I didn't give a shit.  Sure, I've been turned down many many times, but I've also landed some big wins just based on the fact that I was willing to put myself out there.\n\nI am begging you all to just believe in yourself. You're already studying for certifications. You're already on Reddit asking questions about this career path and its future. Perhaps, you're putting in the work at school to complete your degree. Take pride in how hard you're already working for the opportunity and then express that to a hiring manager. As someone who's sat though many interviews, I can tell you that confidence, communication, and customer focus can put you leaps and bounds ahead of the competition. The technical aspect can be taught to those who are willing to put in the hours. However, if you walk into an interview and can stress the importance of what we do from the end users (customers) perspective, I'm interested.\n\nBe calm, confident, and shoot for the position/salary you want, NOT what you think a company is willing to pay. Of course be reasonable in your expectations, but don't sell yourself short. If the median salary for someone with a CCNA is $70k/year, but you don't have one, submit for $60k and go from there. If a company can get you at a discount AND believes you're trainable then perfect! If a candidate is 20% over the salary expectations, that doesn't automatically rule them out. If that candidate counter offers, it tells me they value their time. And IF I can swing paying 20% extra to make you that much more happy, motivated, and productive, you can bet I will.\n\nDon't be afraid to be disagreeable and negotiate, especially when you've put in the work to land a higher paying job. When you go into an interview, go with the mindset that you have something of great value to offer via time and effort. Go in believing that any company would be LUCKY  to have you on their team. If you don't believe in yourself, how can you expect a company to?\n\nGood luck""","RANT: For the sake of all things holy, have some freaking confidence",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/nlnvp3/rant_for_the_sake_of_all_things_holy_have_some/,2021-05-26 18:26:48,May,2021

My beginning is probably different than most because I learned IT in the Marines and that\u2019s what I did as my job. I\u2019m leaving out a lot of detail and other things that may be relevant but I\u2019m typing this up on my phone so whatever. If you have any questions or want me to elaborate more let me know! Anyways here we go.\n\n2016, $23/hour - Desktop Support Technician: I did all the basic things a desktop support tech would do. Active directory password resets, unlocks, security groups, home directory configurations and adding new computer objects to the domain. Also did hardware repairs and installed new desktops, laptops, tablets, IP iPhones, printers and scanners. The job was fun and unique because I was a contractor on a naval base. Got to see a lot of cool things and everybody I interacted with was nice and respectful. I never had an issue with someone yelling at me or freaking out about their problem. It was a requirement for me to have a Security+ certification and clearance. \n\n2018, $60k - Information Systems Security Officer: I learned so much in this job and was in way over my head and barely had half the experience or skills they were looking for. I didn\u2019t have experience with Linux, auditing, SIEM, group policy, firewalls, database servers, license servers or any of the policy requirements, regulations or laws set forth by the various government agencies. I was apart of a team of about 7-8 who were completely responsible for nearly a dozen air-gapped networks. Each environment had specific software, operating systems and tools they had to use. Some things overlapped but learning the general layout of each network was difficult at first. The networks varied in size from 10 systems to over a 100. I had to do weekly audits of systems, brief new users on policies, responsibilities and procedures. Do system hardening and configuration using STIGs and SCAP scans. I used Ansible for Linux system configuration changes and updates. Patched and updated Windows and Linux. We had to evaluate system changes and how it effected the security of our networks. This job was a lot of googling, troubleshooting and reading on my own before I asked for help. Team members were helpful and I got along well with all of them. This was also when I was going to school for a degree in IT which I do have now. \n\n2019, $63k same job but just got a raise. I was becoming dependable and a solid member of the team. But I was becoming overtasked and there never seemed to be enough time to focus on a specific project because I was running around from lab to lab helping people with other problems and other projects. I could\u2019ve stayed and worked later hours but I enjoy a work life balance. Although there was some times l would stay late or work on weekends for system upgrades and updates. \n\n2020, $66k - Got a a raise in December late in the year because of COVID. I came into work like normal during the entire pandemic. Most guys on my team had kids so they maybe came to work 2-3 days out of the week. I also lived the closest to the office too and was not particularly worried about catching it. This was also when I decided I wanted to leave this job because it was getting repetitive and I didn\u2019t enjoy going to work anymore. Applied to new jobs to anything cybersecurity related. \n\n2021, $95k - Cybersecurity Analyst: This is a new job I started last month. I moved across the country for it. I\u2019m still getting settled in here but I will be running vulnerability and SCAP scans, applying STIGs, patching and updating systems, creating new system baselines and generating  reports. \n\nI\u2019m honestly surprised I have come this far so soon. I work hard but only when it\u2019s required. Like I said before, I need the balance with work and other things in my life that I enjoy. I want to avoid the mental burnout of constantly learning and working nonstop. I\u2019m not the smartest or most knowledgeable person about any topic but I\u2019m a problem solver. I research and troubleshoot until I figure it out just like everybody else does.\n\nUPDATE: Thanks the support everyone! Here are some answers to questions that I have seen.\n1. The first two jobs were in San Diego county. As you can guess, there are a lot of opportunities there because of the massive military presence. Only downside is the Cost of living. \n2. The baseline requirement for working as a contractor is having an active secret clearance and a Sec+ this is probably the most important factor in my progression.

If you stay at a company and don\u2019t get a raise that outpaces the rate of inflation you\u2019re losing money. Even if it\u2019s the same job title and responsibilities.

Tell me exactly what to do?\""\n\nHere's the formula:  choose a path for yourself.  Have a defined *long-term* goal, and work toward it.  It should take you at least 5-10 years to reach this goal, and it's OK if it changes over time.  If your goals stop after you get your first entry-level role, then that's where you'll stall until you decide what to do next.\n\nMost people who get stuck at helpdesk are there because they just don't know what to do next.  Networking?  Security?  Systems administration?  I don't know - someone tell me what to do!  But no one will - that's a decision that only you can make.  And your boss likely won't do it for you.\n\nThere's no defined path upward in the vast majority of IT roles - this is something you just have to do yourself.  \n\nAs an example - let's say your goal is to be a cloud architect.  Your plan to move forward might look like:\n\n- Get a CS degree\n- Internship with a big company\n- Entry-level role after graduation doing cloud admin work\n- Look at Google/Azure certs to decide on a direction\n- Cloud-centered position at an MSP or at a cloud provider\n- Move to more advanced roles\n- etc.\n\nThe further out you go the less well-defined the goals need to be since they could change along the way.  But as long as you have a defined path in your head, then **what you're doing today should be preparing you for what your next step should be**.  And if you don't know that next step, you're going to stall.  No one will tell you what to do if you can't decide for yourself. And you should ALWAYS have a \""next step\"" until that next step is retirement.  \n\nAnd maybe your goal is, \""decide what specialty to do\"" - that's completely valid, since that'll force you to focus on making that decision.  You'll pay attention to what's available, cross off things you don't like, make a short list of the ones you do, etc.  So it's still OK if you don't know exactly what you want to do, as long as your goal is to make that decision.  But having a plan is your responsibility - don't overlook it.""",Want to be successful in IT?

I showed that I was open to learning everything.\n\nBecause of this the company rewrote the position to fit me, acknowledging that I was still in training and they were happy for me to continue training while working for them.

It really shows enthusiasm for the field and for learning / developing your self. \n\nI know a lot of people are cost prohibited, so you can do this for super cheap. You don't need a full kit for the raspberry pi, but even with a case you can do this for under $100.   \n\n\n[\\>> Video Tutorial on YouTube <<](https://youtu.be/HxpgbZZk1Rw)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll you need to do is configure the raspberry pi to use a [noip.com](https://noip.com) (free) domain name, put the dynamic update client on your raspberry pi to update the no ip domain to always resolve to your public IP even if it changes. Then you install PiVPN (OpenVPN) with a one liner, set up a port forward on your router, extract the client profile from the pi to say your phone for example, then you have remote access from your home network!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only is remote access cool, but it provides you security on public networks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from that, you can talk about this project in interviews. If the situation allows, you can even pull out your phone and show the interviewer how you connect to devices in your home over SSH using Termius. It's just IT nerdy and cool lol.... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I interviewed for my last job the convo was like this:  \n\n\nInterviewer - Dude....you have a VPN to your home???  \n\n\nMe - Yeah, lol\n\nInterviewer - Why??\n\nMe - It's just cool, I use it to control my automated home stuff, send messages to my wife via a webserver that I have configured, and stuff like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInterviwer - So just regular IT Nerd stuff :P \n\nMe - yeah pretty muchj\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInterviewer - That is really cool, nice work!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus points if you look up the workings of OpenVPN and this setup, so you can explain why it is secure. Of course theres a way to hack everything, but there is really no gaping security hole by doing this. And if you can explain why the interviewer will definitely be impressed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust thought I would share for free, something cheap that helped me land my \""grown up\"" job that changed my life. Hope you guys enjoy :D\n\nEDIT; can\u2019t reply to any of your questions here, mods banned me!! Sorry I can\u2019t answer. I was banned for the affiliate links in video description. \n\n\nThis project is definitely aimed at entry or intermediate level folks / applicants. If it doesn\u2019t relate to your job, but you have listed homelab on your resume (maybe due to lack of real experience), you can still use this as an example of how you invest your time in learning and developing your skills. And to address one commentor, yes, never ever make up answers/bs/lie to an interview question! Lol\n\nAnd no, you don\u2019t list \u201cVPN\u201d experience on your resume after this haha. Maybe mention something about openvpn on raspberry pi in your self development section. Then be honest about your experience level and what you know when you approach the topic. Key is honesty, not inflation :D\n\nEdit 2: I guess after the positive response they unbanned me! Thank you mods. \n\nLast disclaimer, this is definitely just one little trick you might have in your bag for resume/interviews. Don\u2019t go in bragging like your some computer god just by setting this up, but it\u2019s a fun and interesting project you can talk about if the opportunity presents itself. People say this only works for mom and pop shops but my interviewers at Cisco were excited to hear about it so it depends on the company. Always use your common sense and best judgement!

Chango99,1653847175,,,101,v0gnip,671,ITCareerQuestions,"""You can find my previous post [here, when I just landed my DevOps Engineer role](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/p73x0o/last_year_i_switched_careers_from_manufacturing/) \n\n**TL;DR**: Title. Started in help desk in 2020, got into DevOps role in 2021, now the lead Infrastructure person at a SaaS Provider\n\n  \n\n- **Background:** Typical gamer story in which I built my own computers and am a tech enthusiast so \u201ctech-savvy\u201d, random major in Econ, random career in manufacturing for 5 years, wasn\u2019t happy, thought about IT \n- **Transition:** Finally took the dive to study in my evenings and get the A+,Net+,Sec+ between 2018-2020 (had major life things going on then too) while working full time \n- **Career jump:** Took a paycut to start MSP as an L1, really uncomfortable early on since I never worked customer support or tech support for that matter. I grew really fast, learned a lot about Linux, networking, and VMs, got lots of commendations. I got bored, learned some Python, and after half a year, since they weren\u2019t moving me up, I went looking for new opportunities and got some lateral move offers that I wasn\u2019t happy with. So, I paused the search, got a minor promotion, and continued to pursue cloud certs AZ-900, AZ-104, AWS CCP in about 1.5 months time. I also familiarized myself with Ansible, Terraform, and Git as they were popular tools in the job hunt descriptions for Cloud Engineer/DevOps Engineer roles. \n  \n\n### Current Company:\n\n- Through luck and perseverance, DevOps Engineer role at startup landed. I learned later on that I scored really high on the take-home assessment (I usually do, and probably why I landed my previous offers too, high CCAT tests), and they liked my personality and willingness to learn, despite my lack of experience. \n- I thrive in the role, learning many DevOps tools more formally. Our director has been the mastermind behind most of the infrastructure, and I did a lot of the day to day work. Shorthanded (we\u2019ve been looking to hire more, but struggling to find a good candidate), and having people again applauding me, so I took an opportunity to ask for a raise at half a year in and got 12% pretty easily. (I also went into the job market again and got offers so it gave me confidence) \n- Due to unforeseen circumstances, my boss had to go so it\u2019s been left up to me. We\u2019re on good terms, but sad to see him go as he was someone I looked up to a lot. The CEO offered me a good bonus to stay on so sure, why not. New CTO has also been more hands on with me now \n\nIn my solo time, I have shown leadership that I am capable of and have taken a lot of ownership for the department and the future growth of it. While I am not the most technically adept person, I am very mindful of internal customers and the needs of the business. I am making changes to help with the onboarding process of others. I\u2019m doing more than I ever was previously when I had my old director as a crutch, because I relied on seniority and authority to make decisions, now it\u2019s mostly up to me so I\u2019m forced to make those decisions. I still have a lot to learn, and I\u2019m still at a toss up whether I\u2019m better off as a lead/manager type or the technical person. I still prefer for my current stage to have a mentor but, nonetheless, the current opportunity granted to me is a way to improve my resume and continue growing during uncomfortable periods.\u00a0\n\n  \nAnd to those out there feeling that imposter syndrome, I feel ya. But honestly, that\u2019s a good thing, we should feel like we\u2019re the dumbest in the room so we can aspire to improve ourselves. If you\u2019re like me as well, I've had both metrics showing me far above my peers and verbal praise from others so that reassures me.\n\nMy plans for now are to stabilize, minimize new projects and just keep the system going. I\u2019m likely to stay on for the bonus but I am not sure where I\u2019ll be come 2023. As far as technical learning topics for projects when I have more free time, I want to get to know more Git version control, containers, docker, kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, FOSS monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki).\u00a0\n\n  \n\n#Tech Skill Advice\n  \n\nIf you haven\u2019t been able to tell, I\u2019m just figuring things out as I go. I advocate for habit setting (I suggest reading the book Atomic Habits!) to keep improving through life (like setting aside time for studying, exercise, etc) but I also go through periods of high motivation and other times of giving myself the okay to relax. That means, in my free time, sometimes I work a lot for months, and other times, like recently, I was playing a LOT of Elden Ring (400 hours in 2 months).We\u2019re all human and have different things to manage in our lives, so look out for yourself and set yourself reasonable expectations that keeps you going, that\u2019s key, making things reasonably sustainable.\n\nOn the career focused subject, if you are still early into your career, certs are highly recommended as you have to make up for your lack of experience to make yourself look more appealing to employers. Find what seems like a reasonable next step in your career, and look for certs for that. Just starting? CompTIA Trifecta. Network/System Admin/Engineer? CCNA. Cloud? AWS SAA, GCP ACE, Azure Administrator. Etc. I would recommend setting a habit of daily studying 1-2 hours a day, maybe more during your non-work days. These certs will give you more opportunities to interview as you get through resume filters, and, if you\u2019re able to practice and lab, will be useful if you do end up using it. Iin honesty, the most useful cert for me has been Network+ just because in my entirety as a tech enthusiast, I never exposed myself much to basic networking.\u00a0\n\n  \n\nAt this point for myself, everything I learn is on the job training, but I do want to pursue the CKA as I do use Kubernetes and need a better idea on how to implement things. For the most part though, I think certs aren\u2019t as important as you skill up.\u00a0\n\n#Job Hunt Tips\n\n###Resumes\n\nI looked at job descriptions and what tools they were looking for, then tailor my resume to that. Even with no experience and my first job into IT, I sprinkled a lot of those tools and terms into my resume to get past automated filters. I practiced them a little bit to be able to speak to them, so like VMs, Ansible, Terraform, I knew very basic things from a few hours of labbing and had them on my resume.\u00a0\n\n  \n\nLess important in IT I think, but work in metrics if you\u2019ve got them.\u00a0\n\n  \n\nHere\u2019s some examples from my help desk role:\n\n  \n\n- Technical Skills: IPv4 addresses, subnets, LAN, VLANs, WAN, firewalls access controls, packet inspection, DNS, DHCP, VPN; VSS backups, CHKDSK, SFC; ACL, user permissions; virsh, VMs, VMware, Hyper-V; iSCSI, SMB, NFS, NAS shares; ZFS, zpool; Ubuntu; SSH, CLI/CMD troubleshooting; Linux, Windows, VMware logs; hardware troubleshooting, diagnostics, migrations, & deployment; Salesforce Service Cloud \n- Record actions thoroughly, summarize, and provide guided next steps, using formatting such as code blocks and images to improve coworker parsing, warranting commendation from peers on case ownership. Effectively improving time to case close by 50% and increasing personal case bandwidth by 69%.\u00a0 \n- Maintain service level agreements (SLA) by handling 200% increase over average tech workflow while maintaining over 80% scheduled call volume adherence\u00a0 \n  \n  \n\n### Applying to Opportunities\nI\u2019d say don\u2019t be afraid to do different things depending on the roles. I did some of the numbers games and just had a general IT resume that I mass applied with LinkedIn or Indeed\u2019s easy apply options. I threw in a general enough cover letter as well.\u00a0\n\n  \n\nThat said, if I found a position I really think I fit well with, I took more time to modify my resume and cover letter. In fact, most of those I got through multiple interviews came from these local companies that I catered my resume more towards as there was likely a smaller pool of applicants, I made myself to surely stand out.\n\n  \n\n###Interviews\nPractice STAR and also work on confidence (yes, tell yourself *I'VE GOT THIS*). Don\u2019t be afraid to say you don\u2019t know, or to ask for clarification. I conduct interviews now, and I\u2019ll say, we\u2019re not looking for gotchas. I understand you\u2019re probably nervous and you don\u2019t know a lot about our platform, so I will try to start with a more easy and relaxed conversation before diving into anything too technical. I want you to be able to convey your personal career experiences well and to see if that matches well with what my company needs. I personally am looking more for someone who knows how to look into things than any specific skill, even if I do ask some technical questions, I\u2019m trying to gauge a person\u2019s thought process and communication skills most of the time.\u00a0\n\n  \n#Hope that helps everyone! \nI am so grateful that I took this career leap. I find so much more identity in IT and am very fortunate to be where I am today in such a short time frame, but there\u2019s been a good amount of work put into that to make me eligible for those opportunities that have been out there.\u00a0""","In less than 2 years, from 40k/year help desk to 125k/year DevOps Team Lead",0.9400000000000001,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/v0gnip/in_less_than_2_years_from_40kyear_help_desk_to/,2022-05-29 17:59:35,May,2022
Rob_Aught,1685976414,,,188,141gwmp,669,ITCareerQuestions,"""First, my bona fides. I've been working in technology since the dotcom boom and bust. That means I was around for the financial crash as well. I've seen this industry get hit twice specifically and also caught up with the general downturn that hit during the 2008 Financial Crash and the initial 2020 COVID downturn. Most of my career has been spent in some sort of leadership capacity.\n\nI graduated college with a Liberal Arts degree. Make your jokes. I taught myself how to code back when there wasn't a ton of websites, training programs or boot camps. A big change from when I started to today is that at least when people tell me they want to learn how to code there are plenty of resources to help get them started.\n\nI've led teams across the US and the Globe. If it is an emerging tech market in the world I've probably had a team there. I've also led almost every kind of team from development, testing, project managers, support, business analysis, and some I'm probably forgetting. I've done and seen just about every angle of this industry.\n\nI've been reading through some of the threads and what I see are a lot of symptoms of the over-hiring craze of the last few years. People flocked to social media and fed everyone a bunch of lies about tech. They made FAANG's seem like the norm but FAANG's are NOT the tech industry. They don't represent normal pay (which is still good, but not the crazy rates of \""Big Tech\"") They made it seem like you could do remote work forever. Fun fact: Since I started working this is the 3rd time we've done \""Remote work is great and we're never going back to the office\"". This is cyclical.\n\nTruth is you can find a good paying job that is entry level, that will pay the US median salary or better at ENTRY LEVEL. I don't think people appreciate what that means. Plenty of jobs in the US pay less than 6 figures even if you work it for 20 years! If you can get into programming you'll be making 6 figures in 5 years even if you live in Podunk, Alabama. Some places will pay you that much at entry level though usually in places where the cost of living will eat your paycheck so fast it will feel like poverty.\n\nI see a lot of people toiling away at help desk complaining about not being able to move up. Here's something everyone needs to know whether you are help desk, a coder, a tester, or whatever.\n\nThis industry has a ton of gatekeeping and the people who get \""tapped on the shoulder\"" to do something else are exceedingly rare. The people who tend to move up the fastest study and practice on their own, research on their own, find mentors, network, and take every opportunity to practice and learn new skills.\n\nYou can be a success and you can move up but you have to put in the work, you have to build a support system, and you absolutely must be excited about continuous learning.\n\nThe truth is this industry is not for everyone. I never tell people to learn to code because it pays well. It pays well because it's so hard to find people with the aptitude for it. You have to be able to look at the world a certain way, to figure out complex puzzles in your head and then translate that into code. This is damn hard to learn if you're not already an abstract thinker, which is why we see so many math degrees in this industry.\n\nWe're also flooded with boot camp grads who learned mostly front-end languages sold a lie about their marketability because, once again, people thought it was what FAANG's wanted while we have an ongoing shortage of Java, C#, and C++ developers. There's actually a COBOL shortage but I wouldn't advise anyone to learn that right now.\n\nThings are bad now but they will get better. Tech is not going away. We went a little nuts. This happened during the dotcom boom as well. The jobs will come back, but not the crazy hiring of 2016 to 2020 or that brief bump in 2021. It will be better with fewer openings that are more sustainable with less instability.""",The Truth about the Tech Industry in 2023,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/141gwmp/the_truth_about_the_tech_industry_in_2023/,2023-06-05 14:46:54,June,2023

eagle2120,1573680545,,,59,dvynd8,675,ITCareerQuestions,"""Before I get started, there are a few things I need to explain about cybersecurity - There are a ton of different areas of [\u201cCyberSecurity\u201d](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2017/03/cybersecurity-domains-mind-map.html). \n\nThis post is specifically catered around the core concepts of cybersecurity.\n\nThe most basic thing you need to understand about cybersecurity: It revolves around stuff communicating with other stuff. Anything from side-channel attacks to large-scale DDoS\u2019 - stuff is insecure because stuff communicates with other stuff. Communication can be hard understand and even harder to define (let alone secure). I know this is a very vague statement, but it\u2019s one of the core, fundamental concepts of cybersecurity. \n\nThe second most basic thing about cybersecurity you need to understand - \u201chacking\u201d (I hate that word) as it\u2019s known is not some bond-villain type activity. It\u2019s intentionally mis-using something that already exists in a way that introduces a security flaw into the environment. Sometimes the right circumstances line up and this flaw can be leveraged into something, but sometimes it can\u2019t.  \n\nI split up my resources into offensive-based and defensive-based because it\u2019s important for you to understand that while each of these groups are individually important, each knowledge area is not as effective without the an understanding of the other one. \n\nOne other thing to note -  Certifications are great, but you need to de-couple the idea that certifications=knowledge/skills in this field. There are certainly certifications that break out of that mold, but for the most part, this holds true. I\u2019ve ordered them in the order in which I used/learned with these resources, so you can follow-along directly in order (if you want to). I learned offense first, so that\u2019s the way I\u2019m laying it out here.\n\n\nOffensive-Based: \n\t\n\nI started my career in InfoSec by studying for the most basic, foundational certification: The Security+. This is the best beginner-level cert that says \u201cI know something about security.\u201d \n\nI learned by going through Professor Messer\u2019s entire course, and I felt pretty ready after I went through it all. Here\u2019s the [link to his Sec+ course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnVhoAaL4B6aMFDQ8_gdxAy)\n\nNow, lets get into some practical stuff. OverTheWire. These are war-games, or CTF\u2019s - challenges designed to test your practical ability in security, but also designed to help you learn new things. CTF\u2019s are the *absolute best* way I\u2019ve found to learn security. Here\u2019s the [link to OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames) in case Google is down. If you get stuck, here are some [helpful write-up\u2019s](https://github.com/USCGA/writeups/tree/master/overthewire). \n\nDo them in this order: \n\n* Bandit\n* Leviathan \n* Natas\n* Narnia. \n\nAt this point, you should be set to start with the books and Hacking Labs. \n\n* [Penetration Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Penetration-Testing-Hands-Introduction-Hacking/dp/1593275641/ref=pd_sbs_14_5/146-0067845-2391459?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1593275641&pd_rd_r=8f4e9a76-4772-4fea-8bef-3ba03a919d0c&pd_rd_w=aScZ0&pd_rd_wg=ZjfLp&pf_rd_p=52b7592c-2dc9-4ac6-84d4-4bda6360045e&pf_rd_r=A8M77QGHZ4RP6REKNX7M&psc=1&refRID=A8M77QGHZ4RP6REKNX7M) (Book, Follow-along labs)\n\n\n* [Hacking, the Art of Exploitation](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1QLA6PNP0LK7S&keywords=hacking+the+art+of+exploitation&qid=1573663911&sprefix=hacking+the+art%2Caps%2C212&sr=8-3) (2nd Edition, Book, follow-along labs)\n\n\nAt this point, I\u2019d recommend going for another certification - CEH. Once you have the CEH, you\u2019re ready to move into more practical-based certifications. [Here's what I used to learn and practice the CEH:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNvNZOT1rEc&list=PLYmNa3dW770L7qLx5vINs6O19NNf9DTWE)\n\nNow, lets get into some more practical exploitation. PentesterLabs focuses a bit more on WebApp stuff, but I\u2019ve found its the best intro-environment (as it is relatively scripted scenarios, and you don\u2019t have to do as much recon). They're fairly explanatory, and will walk you through the solution if you get stuck. \n\n* [PentesterLabs](https://pentesterlab.com)\n\n\nNext, lets get into HackTheBox (Exploitable virtual machines, ranging in difficulty. You\u2019re going in mostly blind here, so you have to do your own recon and enumeration): [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu) \n\nHere are some helpful write-ups (Written Explanations): \n\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/Hackplayers/hackthebox-writeups)\n\n* [0xRick Webiste](https://0xrick.github.io/)\n\nAlso, there\u2019s some super awesome [video explanations by IppSec](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA)\n\n\nAfter you get through most of these, you should be set to start on your OSCP. The OSCP contains a course (Penetration Testing with Kali), a lab environment (~50-60 vulnerable boxes), and a practical lab test at the end. [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp)\n\nAfter you\u2019ve completed the OSCP, then you have enough knowledge to continue directly down the cert path, and the courses (in combination with the certs) put out by Offensive Security contain enough good content to where you don\u2019t have to study other resources. The certification path from here on out splits into two different areas: Technical, and management. \n\n* Technical: \n\t  * OSCE (OSCP 2, basically)\n\t  * OSWE (OSCP but for web exploitation)\n\t  * OSEE (OSCP 3, really fucking hard). \n\nIf you\u2019re at this point, getting past the OSEE, you can pretty much walk into any offensive-based job, slap you\u2019re cert on the table, and they\u2019ll hire you. You don\u2019t need my help anymore here. \n\nNow, here's the management path: \n\n* Management: \n\t  * CISSP\n\t  * PMP\n\t  * MBA\n\nHaving the technical background of the OSCP, plus a CISSP, PMP, and MBA would create an extremely potent executive - one who can understand the technical details and risk, and who then could translate that into verbiage that other executives could understand. \n\n\nSo, you\u2019re overall standard security offensive certification path should look something like: \n\n* Security+\n* CEH\n* OSCP\n* OSCE\n* OSWE\n* OSEE\n\nOR\n\n* Security+\n* CEH\n* OSCP\n* CISSP\n* PMP\n* MBA\n\nNow, for the Defensive-based side. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a ton of different things you can do on the defensive side.

But I think these are the most important skills as a defender, so I\u2019ll break it up into three smaller chunks.

Below is my journey for any who are interested.\n\nThe brunt of my work experience is mainly retail management. It took over 3 months, 50+ applications, one recruiter who ghosted me, and 3 interviews before given an offer. Although, after reading some stories that others have gone through before finally landing a job, I consider myself fortunate. It wasn't until I changed my resume that I began to receive responses back from employers. I went in thinking I had a fantastic resume, and it was...for retail management. My resume showed that I had years of management experience, special projects, and metrics that highlighted my strengths as a leader. The problem was it wasn't geared towards an IT position.\n\nOver the course of applying for all these positions I was also studying for my A+ exam. While watching Professor Messer I stumbled on a youtube channel called KevtechIT. He has a ton of content, but what helped me the most was his 14 part video series that walks you through basic IT job functions; Downloading virtualbox to mess around with Server 2016, Active Directory, Group Policy, RDP, etc...all of which can be done in a single weekend. He also shows you an IT resume template, which if you follow his videos you can technically use and send to prospective employers. My new boss, who conducted the interview, was impressed that I could speak to this tech despite never being trained in an enterprise or school environment. \n\nI plan on putting in my notice tomorrow and give myself a week to finish studying for the 1002 A+  exam. I passed the 1001 a few weeks ago (thought I was failing it the entire time), and would like to start my new job with an actual certification. \n\nAgain, it can be done. I leaned into my years of customer service experience, my knowledge from the lab projects from KevtechIT/ A+ studies, and my confidence when interviewing. \n\nYou're not too old or too dumb, and *its not too late*. I used my eternal hatred for my retail position to fuel my studying and job hunt. I'm not saying lean into the hate, but hey it worked for me.\n\n*edit* Thanks everyone for the congratulations!

I receive no compensation from anyone for anything, I'm merely trying to help people who are at the very beginning of their IT career journey.  I try to recommend free resources wherever possible.**\n\n&#x200B;\n(Updated for 2024)\nThis plan is cybersecurity focused but can be adapted to most non-developer career paths. It is mainly intended for people trying to start an IT career with mostly free or very cheap resources available on the internet. It's inspired by a good friend of mine who dropped out of high school to go to work in IT.  He never attended any college but now works as a cloud architect for NASA. \n\nEDIT: Many people have asked for a pathway to **cloud engineering**. The best one I've found is detailed here in [this post explaining what to do to get a cloud job](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/xa87x9/sys_admin_to_cloud_possible/).\n\nTo start a career in cybersecurity you should be aiming to eventually get hired into a position as a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst. [A SOC analyst position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5bIhaZOSys&ab_channel=EyeonTech) gives you some insight into a whole range of different information security problems and practices. You'll see incoming recon and attacks, your organization's defenses and responses, and the attacker's counter responses. You'll get experience using a Security Information and Event Management system AKA [SIEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAaRA4ctRL4&ab_channel=CyberGrayMatter). You'll become familiar with all of the security tools in place and start to figure out what works and what doesn't. You'll learn the workflow of a security team and what the more senior engineers do to protect the enterprise. SOC analyst jobs are not entry level [(see this discussion)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCareerAdvice/comments/s319l5/entry_level_cyber_security_jobs_are_not_entry/) but rather a mid-level career goal. After a couple of years in the SOC, you'll probably have a much better idea about your own interests and the path you want to pursue in your career.\n\nHere's how you get there:\n\n**Step 0** (optional): If you have absolutely no tech experience whatsoever you may first have to try to get a job in retail or the service industry that is technology adjacent. Such jobs would include GeekSquad at Best Buy, cell phone sales or technician at a provider like Verizon or T-mobile, or cabling and rack and stack at a commercial data center (smart hands).  My first job after college was in data processing for a cell phone billing company. I did QA for huge stacks of paper cell phone bills, it really sucked. I got fired when they caught me using company resources to look for a better job. It was good enough to help me get my second job which was helpdesk at a large ISP.  \n\nIf this is where you're starting, getting the [CompTia A+ certification](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) might be really helpful for you.  This is considered to be one of the best introductory certifications a new technical track IT worker can obtain.  Thanks to redditor u/Average_Down, who put together a really thorough [study guide for CompTia A+.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/16gsgek/how_i_passed_the_a_2201101/?share_id=vGac3lPruy2sUkhTDZw7i&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) \n\n&nbsp;  \n\n**Step 1:** Get the CompTia A+ (optional) and Network+ certifications. You MUST understand IPv4 networking inside and out, I can't stress that enough. Professor Messer videos are great and free: [Professor Messer A+ series,](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnOmvg5UGVenB_qQgsh01uC) [Professor Messer Network+ series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnlCJiCrOYuRYb6cne864a7G)\n\nSubnetting is a topic that gives a lot of people trouble but can be important in understanding network architecture.  Berry Smith's video series on subnetting:\n- [IPv4 basic overview (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moXYJ1gU47A)\n- [IP addresses vs. phone numbers (Part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2be4QfdgNKg)\n- [Classes of IP addresses (Part 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBjZs4FajhA)\n- [Public/Private IP addresses and subnet masks (Part 4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peRsC0lZpUU)\n- [What is subnetting and why to subnet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yz3FV8WliU)\n- [How to Subnet a Network Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOOPP-ceToc)\n- [How to Subnet a Network Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMmW3dE8160)\n\nMike Meyers has about the best all in one Network + book out right now, you can get that from [Amazon for about $40](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Network-Certification-N10-008-Comptia/dp/1264269056). You can also check out Mike Meyers' channel on Youtube, he has a lot of Network+ videos as well.\n\nHere is a great post [with a comprehensive list of study resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/i7hx4t/master_list_i_compiled_and_ranked_every_major/) for CompTia exams, thanks to u/canadian_sysadmin for this great compilation!\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n**Step 2:** Start learning some basic Linux. The majority of non-desktop business computing is done on a UNIX type platform, this will not change anytime soon.  This is by far one of the best investments of your time you can make, very solid 4/5 Linux skills can make an IT worker millions of dollars over the course of an IT career, no exaggeration.  People, that is life changing money. \n\nThe [Bandit wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is an excellent exercise to start learning concepts and commands.\n\nThe free online version of the book [The Linux Command Line](https://linuxcommand.org/index.php) by William Shotts is also a great resource for Linux newcomers. \n\nFor those looking for a good Linux systems administration book, I'd highly recommend \""Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook\"" by Evi Nemeth, et al. The information is presented in a way that is comprehensible to regular people. You can get a [used copy of the fourth edition for about $10.00](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Linux-System-Administration-Handbook/dp/0131480057/ref=sr_1_3?crid=O6HE618TLM8X&keywords=evi+nemeth&qid=1661595001&s=books&sprefix=evi+nemeth%2Cstripbooks%2C49&sr=1-3). The second edition got me through my first three jobs back in the day.\n\nIf you're more of an audio or visual learner freecodecamp.org has some high quality free intro Linux courses on Youtube:\n\n[Linux Operating System - Crash Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROjZy1WbCIA&t=73s)\n\n[Introduction to Linux \u2013 Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWbUDq4S6Y8) \n\nThe websites [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com/), \n [Tecmint.com](https://www.tecmint.com/free-online-linux-learning-guide-for-beginners/), and [Linuxpath.org](https://linuxpath.org/) are all exceptional online resources for learning Linux.\n\nFor the DIY crowd this post has some great instructions for buildout of a Linux SA homelab.  The instructions are sound and there are helpful hints in the comments.  \n[Learn to be a Linux Sysadmin task list by u/IConrad](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/h16i0j/how_do_i_learn_to_be_a_linux_sysadmin/)\n\nFinally, [Linux From Scratch (LFS)](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own customized Linux system entirely from source.\n\n&nbsp;  \n  \n**Step 3:** Start looking for [helpdesk or tech support jobs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4jgQJG6eMDMRl8zfCJUfMSP1tMAcTD-N) online. You have to do a year or two here to get some hands-on experience on your resume and begin to build your confidence with your technical skills. If you've had great student internships from a degree program or you have experience from military service there's a good chance you'll be able to skip this step.  If you don't have that or any other previous IT experience then starting at the bottom is pretty much unavoidable. \n\nIf you can, use your local community college career center to get some help with a job search or maybe an internship.  Many community colleges maintain relationships with local employers and can act as a potential pipeline to an IT job.  The career center people often know who's hiring and when and they can help you with your resume as well. This is also a good time to consider taking a programming class or two, preferably in python. Community colleges can be great for that, Mark Zuckerberg learned to program at one before enrolling at Harvard and he ended up doing pretty well for himself.  If you can't take a class at community college there are a few free reputable self-paced python classes out there:\n- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python free online book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc)\n- [Harvard CS50\u2019s Intro to Python \u2013 Full Free University Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4)\n- [Free Python Programming Course - University of Helsinki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/vm78c0/python_mooc_helsinki_is_an_excellent_free/)\n\nThe helpdesk job may only pay $20 - $25 an hour or perhaps a bit less but it's only for a year or maybe two years at most, then up and out.  Unless you are completely satisfied with mid-level wages you have to continue to improve your skills and embrace greater job responsibilities.  A lot of people get stuck at this helpdesk stage for six, seven, eight years and it's a career killer.  Why is that?  \n\nTwo reasons.  First, when hiring managers see 3 - 4 years of helpdesk on your resume they begin to assume you have no professional ambition or drive to embrace greater industry responsibility.  Once you cross the 5 year mark that assumption increases and you may not be considered for higher level positions at all by people that think all you're good for is entry-level helpdesk work.  \n\nThe second reason is that you risk becoming a Lotus Eater.  In Greek mythology, the Lotus Eaters were a race of people living on an island dominated by the lotus tree.  The lotus fruits and flowers were the primary food of the island and acted as a narcotic, causing the inhabitants to sleep in peaceful apathy.  Sometimes visitors would find the island. After they ate the lotus fruit they would forget their home and loved ones and long only to stay with their fellow Lotus Eaters. Those who ate the plant never cared to return home or move on with their lives.  \n\nSmall and medium business owners love to bring on inexperienced new IT hires for $20 an hour and then work them like dogs.  In a year or so, they give a raise of a dollar or two an hour.  But something unusual happens.  For the first time, the IT worker can pay all (or almost all) of their bills in the same month.  Then when they get home every night they're too tired to study for certs or work on upskilling.  Instead they play COD or Fortnite for a while, then fall asleep.  Then at work the boss decides to improve morale with a pizza party or a smartphone raffle.  Everyone feels loved and keeps working hard to make the company owner rich.  And oh my gosh, it's just so much effort to look for another job.  These helpdeskers have become trapped in complacency, content to work as hard as they can to enrich others while ignoring the potential of their own futures.        \n\nOne of the things I did right in my career was to minimize my time on helpdesk, I was only there for nine months.  Come up with a game-plan for your own career.  Don't become a Lotus Eater and stay out of the IT version of quicksand.\n**DON'T GET STUCK ON HELPDESK.**  \n\n&nbsp;\n  \n**Step 4:** Get the [CompTia Security+ certification](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnjucQ18QzbCrv-er2zH7d9) while you're looking for your first tech support job or shortly after. Every IT job has a security component now so think of it like basic training in the military.  Everyone needs to go through it.  You should be able to do the cert in just a couple months if you focus and use a [good Security+ study plan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/13vovka/resources_that_helped_me_passed_security/)  \n\nThis is also a good time to start building increased awareness of contemporary information security issues.  Some top resources:\n\n- [Top 10 learning and practice platforms to build up confidence in cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/14q7jhn/top_10_learning_and_practice_platforms_to_build/)\n- [Archived webcasts from the SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/webcasts/)\n- [Archived webcasts from Black Hills Information Security](https://www.youtube.com/@BlackHillsInformationSecurity/videos)\n- [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/)\n- [Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/)\n- [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/)\n- [Social Media Recommendations in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/zc9iaq/im_looking_for_some_recommendations_of_who_to/)\n\n&nbsp;\n  \n**Step 5:** Once you get that helpdesk job, try to do every security related task you can. Ask the senior engineers questions when you get a chance and if they are working maintenance windows ask to shadow them as they work. Eventually they may start giving you some of the more routine tasks and you can add those to your resume.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 6:** Attend [**Bsides conferences**](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage) (very cheap), there is almost certainly one within a couple hours of you.  Live cybersecurity conferences are making a comeback in the post-pandemic world and they can be very helpful for raising your profile and learning about contemporary issues in security.  More importantly these conferences often have sessions dedicated to resume reviews and cybersecurity career counseling where you can get real industry professionals to help you.  Go with a friend or a classmate and split expenses, it's worth your time. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 7:** Try to join a local hackers group similar to [NoVA Hackers](https://novahackers.com/) or [Dallas Hackers](https://www.meetup.com/dallas-hackers-association/).\n\nIt's possible to get your first security job from contacts made at a local hacker meetup.  Physical pentester [Jek Hyde](https://www.scmagazine.com/news/sophie-pingor-breaking-into-walmart-for-the-sake-of-security) got their first pentest engagement from a Dallas Hackers associate and never looked back.  [Hacker groups like these](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Ftechnology%2Fa24676415%2Fdallas-hackers%2Fa) are for knowledge enrichment and community building, not illegal activity.  As long as you check your ego at the door there's no reason to be intimidated.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 8:** Network with everyone you can at security conferences and in your hackers group. Professional networking is extremely important and if you want to be a Red Teamer (and that's most of you, right?) it's absolutely necessary. Pentesters are a tight-knit bunch where everyone knows everyone. The best way in to this highly selective group is to know your shit, then act like [Case in Neuromancer](https://williamgibson.fandom.com/wiki/Case), find yourself a [Dixie Flatline](https://williamgibson.fandom.com/wiki/Dixie_Flatline) and impress the hell out of them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 9:** After you get those certs and some technical work experience, apply for every SOC analyst position you can. It might be difficult to move, but you might have to consider moving to a city that's a tech hub because that's where the jobs are. Seattle, San Francisco and NYC are all outrageously expensive so consider some up and coming tech cities like Dallas, Raleigh NC, Nashville or Austin. Mastercard's infosec dept. is out of St. Louis now. KPMG has a huge facility in Orlando. \n\nPost-pandemic there are more WFH jobs available so if you don't want to move you could concentrate on those, though it might take a bit longer.  Competition for WFH jobs can be insane with openings often getting flooded with hundreds of low-merit applications.  If WFH is your goal you will likely need to be very patient, especially if you're just getting into cybersecurity.  You're probably better off getting an office based job first to build your familiarity with security operations, then looking for WFH once you're an experienced infosec worker.  To check on the geographical availability of cybersecurity jobs take a look at the [CyberSeek Heat Map](https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html) for open cybersecurity positions.    \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 10:** Keep applying until you get that SOC analyst job. Make sure your resume has lots of keywords on it that reference your certs, technical skills, hardware and software you've used, etc. This is to beat automated scanners and ensure that your resume is actually seen by a person.  Use lots of details in your work experience on your resume.  It's not enough to say you used a technology, you have to say what you did with it and what it did for the business.  Try to use [STAR format](https://resumegenius.com/blog/resume-help/star-method-resume) when revising your resume, that will also help with talking points during interviews.   Competition for SOC jobs can be fierce so use your resume to try to stand out and make sure you get noticed and become a candidate for interviews.  When you start applying for SOC jobs you might also want to do [some homelab exercises](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/10cnk8h/need_to_gain_cybersecurity_experience_for_an/) to improve your chances of getting interviewed and/or landing the job.\n\nBack in 2015 when I was hired for my first security role most candidates only needed a year or two of helpdesk experience and the Security+ to make them legit contenders for SOC roles.  In 2024 competition has become very stiff for these jobs with many people applying to them from cybersecurity degree programs and bootcamps.  Hiring managers for SOC positions often have their pick of dozens of applicants.  It still might be possible to land a SOC analyst role with a year or two of industry experience and just the CompTia Network+ and Security+ certs.  However, an applicant that wants to be a very strong candidate for SOC might also want to consider obtaining Cisco's [CCNA certification](https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/) to demonstrate additional IP networking expertise as well as the [CompTia CySA+](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/search/?q=CySA%2B&restrict_sr=1&t=all) certification.  These credentials can help generate the interviews necessary to obtain a SOC job by helping a candidate stand out from the competition.  Some good learning resources that might be worth checking out:\n- [David Bombal's free CCNA course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxZpopqhKk8&list=PLhfrWIlLOoKPc2RecyiM_A9nf3fUU3e6g)\n- [An excellent CCNA study plan from r/CCNA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/14ohsa8/comment/jqdjk04/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n- [Andrei Ciorba's free CySA+ course](https://youtu.be/IGihuL5clDs?list=PLMYSjEaGLw_vGxGsAIUgmkbEm52QR02tx&t=48)       \n\nOnce you start landing interviews it's a good idea to start practicing for them. \nThanks to u/bcjh for posting this [guide to interviewing for cybersecurity jobs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSecurityJobs/comments/11uzvay/dummies_full_guide_and_tips_on_getting_interviews/)\n\n&nbsp;\n  \n**Step 11:** When you finally get that SOC job go out and celebrate.  Guess what, you're an information security professional!\n\nA SOC analyst job should pay from $60K - $80K. You'll stay there for a year or two and get a couple more advanced certs like CISSP, CCSP, OSCP, or eCPPT and then leave for a new job making $80 to $100K.  After 5 or 6 years in the IT/cybersecurity industry with some focus and hard work you should be at $100K+. From there you should be able to map out your own path to $200K, $300K, whatever.\n\nSomething to keep in mind is the salary level you're shooting for. $100K still puts you in the top 20% of salaried workers in the US and the top 10% of workers on the planet. Companies do not give these jobs away. You have to prove yourself over and over. It's tough, but probably not nearly as tough as being a first responder, ER nurse, long haul trucker, or inner city fifth grade teacher. You can do it if you simply refuse to quit. Good luck!\n\nThe program above is mainly for people that are starting from absolute scratch and using no resources beyond the Internet. If you're actually in some sort of formal degree program I'd also highly recommend at least one programming class, preferably in python. Being able to automate tasks is an invaluable skill as a SOC analyst and will set you apart from those that can't.  \n\nAnd since we're on the subject, allow me to give a word of advice to those of you actually enrolled in a degree program.  It's great that you're putting effort into getting your associate degree or bachelor's degree or whatever it is you're getting but you should understand that on its own, a degree will not guarantee a job offer.  In fact, doing the minimum necessary to graduate like showing up for class and turning in homework assignments will almost guarantee that you will be waiting for a job after graduation for quite some time.  It's 2024 and the entry level of the IT market is fiercely competitive now.  You have to distinguish yourself outside of the classroom as much as possible to have a reasonable expectation of getting a job once you complete all your coursework.  How to do this?  What matters most to hiring managers is that you can demonstrate IT skills and problem solving abilities.  What are the best ways to demonstrate such skills?\n- Internships.  By far the best way to demonstrate problem solving skills and talents is to use them in a professional atmosphere and internships are the main way to do this.  Make getting an internship a very high priority from your first day of school.\n- Presenting technical topics at a conference like B-sides, students do this all the time.\n- Earning professional IT certs like Network+, Sec+, CCNA, even OSCP\n- Volunteer for an [open-source project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects/)\n- Join a CTF team\n- Attend one or more [hackathons](https://tips.hackathon.com/article/how-to-find-the-best-hackathons-right-now)\n- Create, join, or attend a Leetcode club\n- Bug bounties or vuln hunting, this can make your reputation and get you paid\n- Pick up some 1099 work on Upwork or Fiverr\n- Do the cloud resume challenge (see below)\n- Use your university career center to help you with your jobs search\n\nMost of all, work on your google-fu.  If any of the above sound appealing, start googling away.    \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 12:**  For people who are interested in focusing more on cloud engineering or DevOps than cybersecurity [this post has a lot of good info](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/xa87x9/sys_admin_to_cloud_possible/) on how to plan a transition.\n\n[The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/w4jvb2/build_something_real_the_cloud_resume_challenge/) could be a really good way for people trying to get cloud jobs to acquire and show off cloud skills to potential employers.  A lot of people seem to have used it successfully for this purpose, including u/rishabkumar7 who documented his progress in a [series of Youtube videos.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/130a439/finally_documented_my_attempt_at_the_aws_cloud/)    \n\nOne excellent option for beginners learning AWS is this [cloud training class by Adrian Cantrill.](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03) At $40 for the class the financial risk is minimal and learning a lot about cloud is becoming essential for technical IT workers.  The course is 75 hours and assumes pretty much no prior technical knowledge beyond basic computer literacy.  With the freebie AWS cloud projects Cantrill posts the course is closer to 100 hours, that's a ridiculous value.\n  \nPerhaps AWS is not part of your plan.  On YouTube there's also a [free class on Microsoft Azure by John Savill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlSVX1WqTXk&list=PLlVtbbG169nGccbp8VSpAozu3w9xSQJoY) that people seem to really like.\n  \nBased on her personal experiences Gwyneth Pe\u00f1a-Siguenza created a very solid [study plan for skills necessary to get a cloud job.](https://www.madebygps.com/cloudcamp/) The author recommends six months to complete the plan, but I think that's a pretty optimistic timeline.  People that have had significant previous technical IT experience could probably get there in six months.  Most people that may only have a bachelors degree or a year or less of IT work experience will probably need closer to nine months to a year to complete it.\n  \nThere are a lot of roadmaps to DevOps and SRE jobs out there but I think this one is pretty comprehensive: [Step by step guide for DevOps, SRE or any other Operations Role in 2023](https://roadmap.sh/devops)\n\nIn a now classic post from 2019, u/lottacloudmoney recounts his initial foray into Cloud Engineering.

aruralthrowaway,1652653010,,,86,uqh0gk,620,ITCareerQuestions,"""Six years ago, I (39) decided to go back to school for IT to turn a hobby into a career. It's been a road with ups and downs but as of last week it has culminated in the biggest salary of my life and the way for my wife and I to dig out of debt and start putting down roots. This is my story and, I hope, an inspiration for others who might need reassurance that you can make it, regardless of your location or experience.\n\nAs I said above, IT and computers were a hobby for me in between various directionless retail and call center jobs. After my first child was born in 2015, my wife and I decided that we could live on a single income if I agreed to go back to school. I researched WGU, figured it was the cheapest and fastest way to a degree, and enrolled in June of 2016 in their Bachelors of IT program. A lot of people don't take to remote learning - but I did, and I was able to graduate in the summer of 2018, figuring the degree (nd my A+, Net+, Sec+, and other CompTIA certs gained in the process) would open up a lot of opportunities.\n\nIt... really didn't. My first few interviews went nowhere and I ended up starting off with contract work, imaging and cleaning laptops for a school system for $10 an hour. It was a 5 week contract and I had to cut it short because my second child was born. But I kept applying, and in September of 2018 I had my first full-time job in IT:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**September 2018: Level 1 Help Desk, MSP, $12/hour, eventually $17/hour.** This was a real trial-by-fire position: I was hired on alongside 3 other techs, all of which either quit or were fired by the end of October. It involved a lot of travel and a lot more of the physical aspect of IT - in my first week I was underneath a county courthouse pulling cable and hauling a network closet worth of equipment up a five story walk-up. It also exposed me to a lot of varied office setups, hardware and software systems, and doing vendor management. I cannot recommend more strongly spending at least 6 months in a high-volume MSP. It will teach you a lot and help you immensely in your time management and troubleshooting skills.\n\nBut don't stay long. The pay is low ($12 starting, $14 after 90 days, $17 after a year), the ability to advance is probably limited, and you *will* burn out. If you aren't the owner or one of the most senior techs, you're going to be overworked and underpaid. I did begin work on my Master's at WGU - first in Data Analytics (stopped after a semester because I realized it wasn't for me) and then in the Managment track (Edit: Masters in IT Management) starting in November 2019. After about 18 months at the MSP, I was recruited by a staffing agency and left for...\n\n**February 2020: Level 3 Help Desk, Construction Firm, $50,000/year.** I and three other techs were responsible for the Southeast region of the construction company, covering a seven state region. The first week or two were uneventful - and then COVID hit. We had to scramble to prep the entire firm to work from home and spin up our new Zoom culture. This was a real trial by fire for me in terms of project management and it inspired me to accelerate my degree and finish in October of 2020. COVID also helped my family reprioritize and begin to more tightly budget and reign in our debt.\n\nThis degree, I think was the real key to my advancement. I immediately started to see upticks in my recruitment calls and interview requests. Just 3 months after completing the degree, I accepted another new position...\n\n**January 2021: IT Manager, Non-Profit Organization, $65,000/year.** The pay increase was the main draw of this job change, especially as in our area the median *household* income is around $33,000 a year - this job put us at over triple that amount with our combined salaries.  It did involve a 45 (and on some days, 120) minute commute, but this is something you end up having to do when you live in an area with under 100,000 people in it and the towns are spread apart.\n\nHowever, this position was not what I expected. What was sold as a basic management position very quickly ran into scope creep, and I was tasked (without an internal staff, simply overseeing an outsourced crew) with multiple major projects that were clearly put on hold for years while they looked for someone in this position. It was difficult work, without anyone to really bounce ideas off of or others in the office that understood the logistics and complications of these updates - but over the first nine months or so I had finished all of the initial projects on the roadmap I laid out with senior management when I arrived. So in January I had a meeting with the directors and was told to expect both a raise and a permanent hybrid work environment going forward. I was told to expect about $80k/year.\n\n3 weeks later, 'plans had changed' and not only would remote work be pulled off the table, but due to 'budget constraints' my salary would need to remain as-is until at least August. No COLA, no inflation adjustment... nothing.\n\nI took a week off right after that and started putting my resume back out there. In March, I began a month-long interview process that has resulted in...\n\n**May 2022: IT Operations Lead, Multinational Corporation, $120,000/year.** I let my (former) boss know about the position and told them that if they could find $95k/year in the budget, I'd stay because I believed in the mission.\n\nThey told me to turn in my equipment at the end of the day.\n\nThe new position is a combination of working with the on-site technology as well as spinning up new projects at their job sites, and while it's yet another sea change from my previous positions, I feel like I'm getting my feet under me and continue to learn and grow. We've also been able to pay off $75,000 in debt since April 2020 and are now going to be able to use this new income to quickly save up for a down payment on a forever home for us.\n\n**So, what have I learned?**\n\n**- Certifications are good, but so are degrees.** If you plan to stay as a tech/engineer your whole career, certifications are by and large all you're going to need and I would never suggest not working on certs and education. However, if you want to move to a management role, get those degrees. They'll get you through the resume screening filters and, at places like WGU, you can often get the certs and the degree in parallel.\n\n**- Upskill, upskill, upskill.** Do home labs. Get a Pluralsight trial and watch some courses (or get your work to pay for it.) If you want to get into management, start reading about and looking at PM certs.\n\n**- Work at an MSP early in your career.** You're going to learn a ton of environments, a ton of scenarios, you'll get better at your personal/client service skills, and you'll expand your network...\n\n**- But get out of MSP work after a year or two.** Outside of some unicorn MSPs, you will not be paid what you're worth most of the time. You'll also want to settle down into a place that has more standardized setups so you can go tall on your knowledge instead of broad.\n\n**- Raises will probably come from job hops instead of merit/time raises until you hit your ceiling.** My offered raises have never been more than a few dollars an hour, at most a $5k or $6k bump after a year. My raises from job hopping?\n\n\\+$16k, +$15k, and now +$55k annually. Unless you're working at a startup that just got a massive angel investment or went public, you aren't getting an 80%+ raise without job hopping. It rarely hurts to update your resume and put your name out there. Someone out there will recognize your worth and pay you accordingly and fairly.\n\n**- Avoid lifestyle creep and manage your debt.** When I got the $50k job, we lived like I was still making $34k and worked on debt payoffs, saving, and investing. This has continued with the $65k job and to my newest job. To be fair, we'll be letting a *little* lifestyle creep happen - we're using part of the first check to replace our 15-year-old washer and dryer - but knowing that most of our money is going to what we want instead of sending payments for things we bought years ago has given us a real sense of peace and tranquility in our household. Allow yourself to enjoy your new wage, but make sure you're also setting yourself up to be OK in a situation where you need to change positions (and take a pay cut) or need to live on savings for an extended period of time.\n\nFinally, thank you to this subreddit for the others that have told their stories and given advice. IT is a wonderfully varied and complex career field, and you can take a lot of paths to success. Let me know if you have any questions - this subreddit has been an inspiration to me and I hope I can give back a little bit.""","$10/hr to $120k/year in the rural Southeast - A story, advice, and a thank you.",0.9500000000000001,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/uqh0gk/10hr_to_120kyear_in_the_rural_southeast_a_story/,2022-05-15 22:16:50,May,2022

There's so much great information in this sub I really don't think I could have gotten to where I am without the countless questions and posts provided here. I am a direct person, and I just wanted to share my experience in the field as well as highlight challenges that are not always talked about. I also decided to include my salary to motivate more people to enter this field, as well as know what they are really worth. I do feel like the path I took was extremely niche and very specific, but it is possible. I did it, so can you. \n\n**My Background (Skip to college if you want to see my career path)**\n\nWhen I was 18 I started community college, and like many others I didn't know what I wanted to do. I took classes here and there and then dropped out to work after 2 semesters. I loved school, but life happened and without family support, it was just not happening financially. I started working full time in a warehouse, and that was it for education at the time. When I started to take it seriously again, I asked a counselor to lay out what classes I needed to get the hell out of there with any AA possible. I had continued to take classes on and off for years. this meant i had 80 credits and needed 4 more GE classes to graduate with an AA is sociology. Welp, that's what I did. I skated by and my 2.51GPA barely made it above the 2.50 GPA needed fro a cal grant (for those of you outside of CA this pays your tuition at any state school)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**College**\n\nWhen I was choosing my major, I knew i wanted to do tech. It was my passion and something that always interested me. But i knew i didn't want to do programming or coding. So i immediately ruled out Computer Science. Then I learned about Computer Infromation Systems. But still, it had classes with C+ and Linux. So I looked at the next, less technical program and found Management Information Systems. \\[[https://www.csuchico.edu/cob/about/departments/bsis/option-in-mins.shtml](https://www.csuchico.edu/cob/about/departments/bsis/option-in-mins.shtml)\\]\n\nWhen I read it, I knew that's what i wanted. I'm a people person so i love interacting. I didn't want to be stuck in a room somewhere googling javascript comile errors \\[programmers ily but i hate coding\\]. When I knew i wanted to be in Management Information Systems, I looked for state schools that had that exact major. I wanted it written on the degree. I didnt want a Business admin: MINS. I wanted it to say MINS. And thats how i landed at Chico State, Arguably the biggest party school on the westcoast.\n\nI didnt know it at the time, but at 26, I was about to embark on the best and worst part of my life. Because the cal grant was capped at 4 semesters, I had to complete 22 upper division courses in 2 years. At the University Level. This included:\n\n* Database Modeling (Both SMSS and MySQL)\n* Database Administration\n* SAP Linux Administration (what's sudo?)\n* SAP Business Simultaion\n* SAP/4Hana Troubleshooting and Documentation\n* Mobile application development (ios)\n* Java (Curse you netbeans)\n* Agile and Waterfall development (SCRUM anyone?)\n* Cisco Networking (I swear if someone ever comes near me with packet tracers or asks me about VLANS or subnets I'm throwing moist gummy bears at them)\n\nI didn't know it at the time, but this coursework, the toughest I ever had to learn would become the cornerstone for my career. Chico State is often seen as a last choice school, but this program prepared me better than many of my peers at more prestigious UC's and state schools. It is an SAP Center meaning they have a direct path after graduation to become SAP certified at a discounted rate. This relationship with SAP means Chevron, Salesforce, Workday recruit heavily in the MINS and CIS departments. My class had 30 graduating students. We were a tiny niche of a program if you will. \n\n**Graduation**\n\nAfter graduation I landed a kushy 75,000 job.... \\*record scratch\\* yeah, no. I don't know who those people are but it didn't work out for me that way. When i graduated and moved back to Los Angeles in 2018, I knew i wanted to be some type of analyst. But i didn't really know what kind, and it didn't help that every company uses the word analyst to mean something different. At one point i remember stumbling upon a Dave & Busters job posting for a 'Fun Analyst'. I was not amused. Around month 6 of my job search when I started to get desperate, I started expanding my search to these roles:\n\n* Information Systems Analyst\n* Business Analyst\n* SQL Analyst\n* ERP Analyst\n* Business Systems Analyst\n* IT Analyst\n* Database Analyst\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1st Role**\n\n**Information Systems Coordinator**\n\n$22/hr + 6 days vacation + 5 sick days \n\nI finally got a call for information systems coordinator, and I landed an offer. To my dismay and horror they wanted to hire at $17-$20 an hour, American dollars, in Los Angeles. I told them $20-$25 is more my range. I ended up taking $22/hr, because at this point I was desperate and wanted to start working. While I knew i was taking a lowball I had 0 experience so I saw it as an exchange. I would get experience at a small company, and they would get me for the cheap. I was the only person in my department, and they misrepresented the position. They told me I would be involved with infrastructure projects. What it really was, was Help desk Tier 1,2,3 + Sysadmin + ERP Admin + Database Admin + SQL Report Writer +  Remote Support (IN SPANISH) + License Auditing + Hardware auditing. Basically not what i had signed up for. But an insane amount of experience. On top of this i met my first GateKeeper. An older IT consultant that was friend with the CEO. He had no business getting paid as much as he did and he never (in my full time there) cared to share any infromation on how anything worked. My skills and talent were a threat to his job security. So any project I had, he would immediately try to shut it down or run circles around it to spin it as negatively as possible. One highlight was me pitching an idea to him, we entered a meeting and he pitched it as if he had thought of it himself. He explained an idea to me that I came up with. After that our relationship deteriorated and I went around him to get things done. He was our consultant, but because of his personal relationship to the CEO, his weights held more gravity. All of these issues combined with the low pay pushed me to start job searching within 8 months of this job. Then COVID happened. My Project highlights at this company include:\n\n* Deployment of labor tracking software including documentation and user training\n* Creating a physical VPN tunnel to Mexico (to on prem servers)\n* Slack deployment (pre covid props to me)\n* Visitor Management software system\n* Several Custom SQL Reports (yeah i can write. So a SQL statement walks into a bar and looks at two tables and says, 'hey, may i join you?')\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2nd Role**\n\nWhen I interviewed with my current Position. I killed the interview. It was a bilingual position for Business Analyst. They required 4 years of experience on the job post but i decided to go for it. They wanted someone who had:\n\n* Manufacturing/Production experience (remember that 5 year warehouse hiatus?)\n* Experience with an ERP - SAP Preferred (check)\n* Understanding of databases (check)\n* Windows Administration (I was help desk in two separate countries at the same time lol)\n* Willing to travel (no kids, Im packing my bags right now)\n\nNeedless to say at the end of the interview, but I always ask 'Whats stopping you from hiring me right now?' Their response: \""um, well... this is going to sound weird... but honestly you're everything we want. You have experience supporting users, negotiating with vendors, SAP, the sales process, you even worked in a warehouse so you've seen the process from the inside'. I knew at that moment I was getting an offer. Their first offer was 70k, I politely declined. I held my guns and said, give me $75k and we can work together. and here I am. Business Systems Analyst. This position entails I route tickets to the support team that needs to see them, I administer 5 different applications/systems, and I am *finally* focused on infrastructure projects. I will be doing 6 ERP migrations to SAP, as well as multiple networking projects at every plant (Im responsbile for 2 locally, but the projects entail 6 nationwide plants). I work with a team of about 12 people, and we have the full support of an IT help desk to handle small day to day issues (hey my printer wont work!!!). I couldn't be happier, and I really feel that I will be able to grow with this company. I work with a manager and team that understands IT and respects my time. When my boss says hes gone at 4, that means HES GONE. Dont send him emails, dont call. and he treats us the same way, which is something I truly appreciate.\n\nSo if youre job searching, and running into roadblocks, just keep looking. the right place will come. Don't sell yourself short. the things we learned are valuable and you should be compensated fairly.\n\nThats all. thanks for reading.\n\nEDIT:\nMandatory OMG MY FIRST GOLD! Lol. Truly thank you. I love this sub and hope I can mentor a few people eventually. (It helps with the imposter syndrome) I hope I inspired someone, even you, lurker. :) \n\nI see a lot of concern about 75k in Los Angeles, and yes you are correct. It is difficult to live on your own, *if* you don\u2019t budget well. I do not live fancy and I don\u2019t plan to until I hit $100k. I had the foresight to save money while i was working full time and bought my car outright. I own my 2015 optima. Having a room mate helps a lot with expenses, and I\u2019m fortunate enough to have learned how to invest and be good at it. It\u2019s been a side source of income since I graduated from college (I started out with $50/week and currently at 20k /240% return... invested in tech of course) but that a story for another post. Additionally the WFH helps immensely with expenses. \n\nI have 2 raises a year written into my current contract, and I believe my bonus is $4k/year starting at completion of my first year. I\u2019m happy where I am at the moment. I won\u2019t be here for long, trust me :)""","I went from 42k to 75k in 18 months.

Humble_Tension7241,1706826601,,,278,1agnmwt,607,ITCareerQuestions,"""\nSince lurking around I\u2019ve seen so many new people looking for practical \u201chow to get the skills and get the job\u201d solutions. Thought I\u2019d share some wisdom from my journey and help others avoid wasted time, wasted money and spare a few others the discouragement so common when starting out \n\n1) Be extremely wary of expensive instructors and boot camps. There are no shortcuts. There are so many trainers out there who have never worked in IT, selling courses promising six figures in 6 months. They are predators. Stay away. They will take your money and offer little support. Network and interact with people who do the job you want. The amount of money required to pass these exams and learn these skills is very little. Udemy is really *almost all you need. \n\n2) What you want to look out for when starting to study for a certification or going down a certification path are the fundamental concepts that will shorten your learning curve. What do I mean by that? What I mean is that there are certain skill sets that are ubiquitous across almost every aspect of IT. For example: networking, Linux, automation/scripting, cloud. If you build solid knowledge in these core areas, you can branch off easily into any branch of IT. CompTia may not like me saying this but, I do not think that the A+ is a good certification unless you\u2019re young and a teenager looking for their first part-time tech job at Best Buy. You\u2019re much better served to jump right into the network+ and Linux+ certifications. Those two right there will get you your first job. If you really feel like you want to do the A+, just take an online course but skip taking the exams it\u2019s expensive and most of the things you learn on that are not going to provide you with the depth of knowledge that you need to do well in an actual job.\n\n3) Cyber security is regarded as the sexiest job in IT, but just know there is no such thing as an entry-level cyber security role regardless of what all the LinkedIn influencers tell you (they\u2019re probably making money off people like you). There are some rare exceptions but they usually require a degree and end with defense contractors. Private sector has even fewer opportunities for this kind of career leap. Cyber security is a very complex multifaceted career that requires a large amount of experience managing, architecting, maintaining critical enterprise infrastructure. Nobody in their right mind is going to hire somebody who doesn\u2019t have experience touching that enterprise infrastructure. Security is a great career path but you need to give yourself time to learn the necessary skills to get there. And you can make plenty of money and do just as well before you get to that point. So don\u2019t sell yourself short by trying to skip steps just because you wanna play Mr. robot. Focus on getting those fundamentals down and getting into a job where you can build out projects that correspond to security objectives. If you can do that, you will absolutely land a security job. \n\n4) In your early studies and early certifications, you do not need to build out extensive PHYSICAL labs but you should include plenty of virtual labs and hands on exercises. Your job right now is to learn the theory of IT fundamentals so you can get that first job. Chances are any physical labs you build will be insufficient as a reference point to the infrastructure you will manage on the job. That infrastructure costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. You just can\u2019t build something like that at home. You can practice things in the cloud or using virtual box, and that makes sense a lot of the time but as far as on premise infrastructure goes with switches and expensive servers, skip that. Focus on passing those initial exams of network+ and Linux+ then learn python or go and code a few projects. Once you get one or two years of experience under your belt, you will have a really good idea of the skills that you need to develop to take the next step in your career. That\u2019s when it makes the most sense to start to invest in a physical home lab. What you should be doing is practical hands-on exercises. There are so many platforms out there that will walk you through setting up cheap virtualized instances of the infrastructure that you\u2019re going to be learning. Places like a cloud guru or kodecloud. \n\n5) When you land that first IT job, identify the most competent person on your team and emulate that person. Be their friend. Watch how they perform their job duties: what is their process, how do they go through an investigation, how do they take notes or how do they track complex issues? But a big caveat in the following point\u2026 \n\n6) IT is filled with know it all jerks. Be the nice guy/girl. Be kind and genuinely interested in others. Besides the moral value of being a good person, your success will be largely predicated on your ability to connect with others (yes, even the jerks) and express complex ideas while driving solutions with people who are having an emotional response to a stressful situation. Being a jerk or arrogant destroys your ability to do those things\u2014people won\u2019t listen to you. However, building political capital and rapport will serve you just as much as your technical expertise. \n\nWho am I? I\u2019m a cloud engineer who started in support and worked my way up to where I am now. I code all day, manage multi-million dollar infra and build out observability tooling in addition to my other responsibilities. I touch containers, serverless/cloud native, security, virtualization, some networking, IaaS, and mostly work in AWS. I have worked in storage and security. \n\nA bit long but I hope it\u2019s helpful. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions. :)\n\n***may edit periodically for typos or other mistakes. Feel free to let me know\u2014typing this out on my phone was a beast. \n\n***originally posted in another forum but adding here as I hope it will be useful""",For Those Starting Their IT Journey: Avoid These Pitfalls,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/1agnmwt/for_those_starting_their_it_journey_avoid_these/,2024-02-01 22:30:01,February,2024

People started to follow my profile. I was sharing my labs, my study resources, my opinion, basically everything related to my certification journey.\n\nAt some point, my posts were getting thousands of views (4k views on average).

I am not talking about going to seminars about personal branding or stuff like that. I am talking about being proactive on social media and the internet. \n\nShare what you are studying. Share what you want to learn. Share the errors you are dealing with. Share your study resources and why they are useful. Share your preparation journey. Share your questions and your opinions. Do not be scared about connecting with total strangers.

I do not care if you are 15 years old. I do not care if you are 70 years old. There is an opportunity waiting for you. But you will never know about it if you have a passive approach on social media. Jeremy Cioara shared this advice, I do not know him, but I will be thankful for the rest of my life because this thing worked for me without even noticing what I was accomplishing. \n\nNowadays, when people have a question here, on Reddit, I try to bring something to the table. When I learn something, I create a post on Linkedin right away. Of course, my life is not turning around social media. I keep a balance. However, you guys lose nothing trying to follow this advice.

I ended up working there longer than I thought I would. I bounced around different departments of the store, started as a cashier, moved onto the grocery department, electronics department, and then customer service associate. The biggest thing this job taught me, was soft skills, and how to defuse tense situations. At this point, I had worked there for nearly 4 years, and I ran into an acquaintance at the store, who exclaimed, \""Wow, you still work here?\"" Which had me feeling pretty low, and over the four years I'd worked my way up from $7.25 to about $9.50 an hour. \n\nI didn't know where to go or what to do. I didn't know what my life looked like. I really lived in the moment. So, in an unwise moment I quit my job on the spot and spent the next few weeks looking for jobs. \n\nI focused and changed my mentality. I spent my now free days behind my taped together laptop searching Indeed, applying for jobs. I applied for Government jobs as a permitting associate, a parks and recreation technician, and just about anything. I spent about 40 hours a week applying for jobs just to see what would stick. \n\nI spoke with a friend of mine, and he recommended getting my CompTIA A+ certification and learning how to fix computers. So, in after applying for jobs all day I began to study for my A+ by using Professor Messer as my main resource. \n\nI had applied and interviewed for a PC Repair technician at a local screwdriver shop, but was turned away due to my lack of experience. I had applied for a job as Help Desk technician at a school. About 10 minutes after applying, I got a phone call for an interview request. I was super nervous, but researched the interview, and asked my friend for relative interview questions. \n\nDuring the interview I remained very humble, honest, and transparent. I let them know that I didn't have a degree, or any relevant IT certifications, and much to my amazement after about an hour in the interview, and a call the next day I got the job. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IT Career Job 1, School Helpdesk Tech $35k per year:**   \n*Good resource:* /r/k12sysadmin*/*   \n*2017-2019*\n\nThis job was like drinking from a firehose. My role was to be a part-time tech for two different schools. I learned about the helpdesk, windows operating systems, print servers, networking, Microsoft Azure, and MS INtune. I took the opportunity to volunteer myself for any available project, would work tickets with blazing efficacy. I eventually got a raise and a full time move to one of my schools, where I shared and office with a Project Manager for the district at large. He was initially present during my interview. Him and I became friends, and when I asked why he had hired me, he said it was for my soft skills, humbleness, and that I was extremely teachable. In his words, which echo in my head still to this day, \""I can teach you how to computer, but I can't teach you how to people.\""\n\n**What I learned from this job:**  \nLight technical skills, repairing laptops, projectors, smart boards, printers.  \nBasics of working a helpdesk, tickets, customer service, delegating tasks to the correct people.  \nProject Management: learning what it means to be on a project team, defining and identifying stakeholders.\n\n**IT Career Job 2: MSP Technician: $48k per year.**   \n*Good resource:* /r/msp*/*   \n*2019-2020*\n\nIn 2019 I was looking for a bit more lucrative opportunity, and got in touch with a recruiter that got me a job at an MSP. This was a double-edged sword, because MSPs, or Managed Service providers are notorious for overworking their staff. This was true, but I also learned so much. I learned so much about Microsoft 365, Windows Server, VMWare, Hyper-V, networking and so much more. But after a while the deliverables became too unrealistic. 24/7 on-call, 55+ hour work weeks, and professional development. With burnout being real, I got laid off because of a \""Reduction in force\"" due to covid. \n\n**What I learned from this job:**  \nSoft Skills: Really being able to understand and defuse a situation, providing great customer service, and keeping somebody engage/distracted while solving an issue.  \nTechnical skills: Systems Administration, and Network administration. Really being able to solve things, perform root cause analysis, etc. \n\n**IT Career Job 3: Corporate IT Support Lead: $75k**  \n*Good resource:* /r/sysadmin  \n*2020 - 2023*\n\nThis really was a different world that I was used to. The IT Department at this company was larger than most of the companies I worked for previously. The job officially was managing tickets and being an escalation point, but it was more about business analysis, and continuous improvement. I became the lead technical contact for the visual marketing department, and I was able to make the job I wanted out of it.   \n\n\n**What I learned from this job:**  \nBusiness Analysis: Observing parts of a business that could use technological improvements, identifying stakeholders and opportunities.   \nCorporate Politics: Understanding who the players are in specific departments, how to get things done while going through red tape and making a name for yourself and maintaining a reputation. \n\n**IT Career Job 4 Business Systems Analyst: $100k**  \n*Good Resource:* /r/sysadmin  \n*2023 - Present.*  \n\n\nEarlier this year, my girlfriend and I moved states, and I was able to take this opportunity. It is the culmination of all of the work I've put in over the years and is really everything I want out of a role. It's focusing on project management, systems building an architecture, and relationship building. \n\n**Closing points:**\n\nMy biggest takeaway, and biggest piece of advice for anyone who wants to start a career in IT is to start at the helpdesk. Learn the basics, learn how to interact with others. People come to you in a moment of need and you can ease their concerns. You read a lot of things about \""How to make 12 figures with no degree in cybersecurity.\"" Though, if you don't know the basics, you won't get there. It doesn't happen overnight. \n\nLearn how to play well with others, learn everything you can. Most importantly? Leave your ego at the door. Don't be the smartest person in the room, learn something from every situation, and don't be afraid to admit that you're wrong.  \n\n&#x200B;""",$9 an hour to $100k over 6 years without a degree.,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/163tzso/9_an_hour_to_100k_over_6_years_without_a_degree/,2023-08-28 18:33:08,August,2023

RawOystersOnIce,1659376214,,,123,wdnpj5,573,ITCareerQuestions,"""I actually transitioned from helpdesk to cybersecurity back in February 2022, I wanted to have at least 6 months of experience in my first cybersecurity position before I posted this retrospective. I don\u2019t post on here much but whenever I mention in comments that I went from 42k a year to six figures in less than 3 years usually a few people message me wanting to find out what I did and if I had any advice. I made a few poor career decisions during this time and some good ones, for this reason I thought this post might help some people.\n\n**Job History Timeline:**\n\nMay 2019: Graduated college with a B.S in Information Technology. I had an IT internship during my last semester which I don\u2019t count as experience anymore, but it helped me land my first real IT position post-graduation. \n\nMay 2019 - September 2019 (Service Desk Analyst, contract to hire, $23/h): Worked as a service desk analyst for a large hospital chain as a contract to hire. The contracting company was TekSystems. The position was absolutely awful, it was basically a glorified call center job where all I would do is reset passwords and install the same 3 software everyday. The floor manager would publicly humiliate you if you made a mistake, he would yell at people and shit talk them in front of everyone else. There was no room for growth and eventually I got so sick of it I called my recruiter and told him I\u2019m about to quit this position without having anything lined up. He talked me out of doing that and ended up finding me my next position.\n\nSeptember 2019 - September 2019 (Windows Migration Technician, contract, $23/h): The same TekSystems recruiter found me a position at a military equipment manufacturer as a Windows Migration Technician. Basically I was just there to help them migrate their laptop and desktops from Windows 7 to 10. Unfortunately after 4 days I was fired from this position for \u201cAsking too many questions\u201d. I later found out that this company hired 10 contractors and after 4 days fired 5 of them on the same day. The recruiter told me he didn\u2019t have anything else lined up, so I was fucked in that regards.\n\nOctober 2019 - December 2019 (Windows Migration Technician, contract, $25/h): About a week after I got fired a recruiter from Apex Systems contacted me about an opening for the exact same type of contact that I was just fired from, only at a different company. This time it was a telecommunications company. I didn\u2019t tell the recruiter that I was just fired from the same position, and I got the contract. The work was pretty chaotic, the inhouse IT staff\u2019s asset management software was completely disorganized, they did know how many devices were Windows 7 or Windows 10, we literally had walk to every cubicle and ask the user what their operating system was. Nobody was keeping track of what the contractors were doing, one of the other contractors who was hired with me would show up to work in the morning, pretend to work for about a hour, then would disappear for the whole day only to come back at the last hour of the work day and pretend to work. I found out on the last day of the contact that he was working as an Uber driver simultaneously while \u201cworking\u201d at this contact. The inhouse IT staff never found out about this, they thought the reason they never saw him was because he was somewhere else in the office working. I could go on and on about how mismanaged this project was, but overall I liked my boss and coworkers, so I didn\u2019t hate the position. The contact ended Dec 31st and I was unemployed again.\n\nFebruary 2020 - May 2020 (Windows Migration Technician, contract, $20/h): I moved to a new state and found another contact position doing Windows migrations. At this point I absolutely did not want to do another short term contact, but I had no choice because it was either that or being unemployed. This contact was actually well managed compared to the previous one, everything was organized and we got a lot of stuff done. I knew this contract would end eventually so I decided to start actually applying to full time positions instead of waiting for my contract to end. \n\nMay 2020 - September 2020 (IT Consultant at MSP, permanent, 50k/y): The way I got this job was actually pretty unusual. I previously interviewed for this position before I started working at my last Window Migration job, the MSP owner chose to go with another candidate, but I later found out that he fired that guy for some unknown reason. While I was working at my last position the recruiter who set up this initial interview called me to ask if I was still looking for a job, she then told me I should contact the owner of the MSP because he doesn\u2019t work with this recruitment company anymore. So the next day I found the owner\u2019s LinkedIn page and sent him a message basically asking if he had any positions available. He wasn\u2019t planning on hiring anybody else but for some reason he decided on the spot that he wanted to create a position for me, two weeks later I was working for him. The position was essentially desktop support for an MSP, I worked from home and would travel to client\u2019s offices. Unfortunately I was laid off from this job due to Covid-19, the MSP lost a few of their big clients who went bankrupt, my position had to be eliminated because there was very little work to assign me. The MSP owner apologized to me, said it was his fault not mine that I am being let go, and he left me a recommendation on my LinkedIn page.\n\nOctober 2020 - January 2022(Help Desk Technician, permanent, 42k/y: A few weeks after my lay off I was offered a position as an IT Tech/help desk at an engineering company. The company was paying me less than what I was making at my previous position, but I was unemployed so I took it. The position was alright for a help desk job, I like my boss and coworkers. We were understaffed and that made the workload pretty bad, but it kept me busy and they let me work from home 4 days a week, which was pretty cool. This position was also cool because they invested in career development for their staff and let me get basic hands-on experience with Windows Server, Azure, Nutanix, Proofpoint, etc. This helped me a lot in getting my next and current position. After I got one full year of experience at this place I got really burnt out and knew I really wanted to get out of entry level support, so I started applying to cybersecurity positions.\n\nFebruary 2022 - Present (Technical Account Manager - Security, permanent, 105k/y): After months of applying, 30+ interviews, lots and lots of rejections, I finally got offered my current position. The company is actually paying me more than what I asked for. I asked for like 80k during my initial screening with HR, after I got offered the position the recruiter told me that 80k was to low for this position and they don\u2019t want me to go looking for a new job when I discover I\u2019m being paid less than what I potentially could make elsewhere, so they increased it to more than 100k. So far I am loving the job, it's fully remote and I genuinely enjoy what I do. I don\u2019t dread going into work like I did at all my previous jobs. \n\n\n\n**Key things that got me the cyber security job:**\n\n-While I was a helpdesk tech I tried to get involved in anything related to cybersecurity so I could put it on my resume. Our security guy sent us a message asking if anybody wanted to help him run our phishing/user training platform knowbe4, I immediately volunteered. After that, I built a relationship with our security engineer and he would give me simple tasks to do that he didn't feel like doing or didn't have time to do. I would then put that experience on my resume. A lot of the experience I built during this time was because I asked for it, nobody intended to give me access to Azure, after I bugged the sysadmin for long enough he finally let in and did it.\n \n-The company that I work for currently is a vendor that sells a cyber security product. By coincidence the help desk position I had was with a company that used this product and gave me admin access to it. Because of this I became semi familiar with the product and was able to leverage that when interviewing for this company.\n \n-Studied as much as possible about security. Everytime I went to an interview and they would give me technical questions, I would write down the questions I didn\u2019t know and look up the answer later. I noticed that a lot of interviewers were asking the same questions, it was almost like they all googled \u201cbest entry level infosec questions to ask on an interview\u201d and were reading off this list. After a while I became very comfortable answering questions.\n\n\n\n\n**Mistakes I made/things I learned:**\n\n-Avoid short term contracts at all costs unless you are desperate. Having a bunch of short contracts on my resume sucked, employers don\u2019t like to see a resume with 3 years of experience with 5 different companies. I make it as clear as possible on my resume that these were short term temp contacts, but most don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t even list my contacts on my resume anymore, if anyone asks why there is 7 month gap from the time I graduated college to the first position I list on my resume, I just tell them i went backpacking after college, its better than seeing all my shitty contracts. Plus temp contracting sucks in general, you do basic tedious work, you have to be looking for a new job all the time, you gain little actual practical experience, the in house IT staff don\u2019t treat you like a fellow employee because they know you are going to leave soon. Just don\u2019t do it.\n\n-When interviewing for your first help desk job, make sure to ask what kind of technology you will be exposed to and have access to. Not all help desk jobs are equal, some of them won\u2019t let you do anything except change passwords and install adobe. Others will give you access to a wide variety of technology which you can then put on your resume. This is essentially how I was able to transition to cybersecurity, by leveraging the experience I built during help desk. \n\n-Entry level certifications are virtually valueless to 95% of hiring managers. I have a Comptia A+, Security+, and a AWS SA cert. Not a single time did anyone mention that on my resume or cared if I brought it up. In the case of the AWS cert, unless you have direct experience working with AWS in a production environment, nobody cares that you passed an exam. Certs are meant to prove existing knowledge you got on the job, not get you a job if you don\u2019t have experience with that cert subject.\n\n-Don\u2019t post your updated resume on a job board if you are currently employed. I did this during my last help desk position and apparently the company\u2019s HR found out about it and notified my boss. I had to have an awkward conversation with him and basically lie to him that I\u2019m not looking for a new position. For the next few months I thought I was going to get fired any day because my boss thinks I\u2019m about to leave the company.\n\n**EDIT:** A lot of people seemed to be irritated when I said that entry-level certs are mostly valueless. Let me reexplain what I am trying to say. I am not saying that getting certs are valueless completely, what I am saying is that entry level certs do not substitute actual experience and people on this sub over value certs as a means to get their preferred position. This is mostly a response to the 1000s of posts on this sub that are like \""What cert will qualify me to become a sysadmin\"" or \""Will an AWS cert get me a cloud position?\"". From my own experience, if you have a cert but don't have actual work experience to go along with that cert, it is essentially valueless (the one exception to this is government security jobs, which do actually require a Sec+ or similar certification). Very few people will care that you have an AWS cert if you never actually worked with AWS in a production environment. Especially for entry level certs, anybody can cram for a test and pass it. I passed my CompTIA Sec+ exam after only 10 days of studying for it, and I am not smart by any means. This is why hirer end certs like CISSP, CISA, PMP, all require you to have years of documented and verifiable related work experience before you are even allowed to take the exam. Even on entry level certifications like the CompTIA A+, on the documentation it says that although there are no required pre-requisites for taking the exam, they recommend you have a year of work experience before you take it.\n\nThe point being, certs are meant to compliment existing work experience, not substitute for it. During my career I never once felt that a cert that I got helped me land a position, not a single time did a hiring manager ask me about the cert or even comment on its existence. It's as if it wasn't even on my resume. Actual related work experience was all that mattered, the bachelors degree helped get pass HR, but really all hiring managers cared about was how my previous help desk experience translated into the position I was applying for.

Whether or not that's the case for you, I sincerely hope this resume format helps you find a better job than you had going into this mess. In addition to having [S&G help how we can](https://sheetsgiggles.com/blogs/news/s-gs-response-to-the-covid-19-crisis),  I'm going to do my best to answer Reddit PMs and emails that come in re: job hunting during April as people face this crisis. (Please at least edit your resume into my format below before asking me for a critique, as my first advice to anyone who hasn't will be to guide you to my format.) All my best to you and yours, and I hope you're all staying safe out there.\n\n**11/17/2018 last edit (psyche):** I'm working 16+ hour days as CEO of [Sheets & Giggles](https://sheetsgiggles.com) nowadays, so I unfortunately don't have time to reply to PMs (get about 10 a day still). So sorry! If you have more questions, please see [this follow-up thread with FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8hs6xc/part_deux_of_the_top_post_of_all_time_on_rjobs_im/) I did a couple months ago. Good luck everyone! - Colin at S&G\n\n---\n\n#Original Post:\n\nThere was a recent post on Reddit where someone was lamenting that they had sent out dozens of applications, but hadn't heard back from anyone. I commented and told them they probably had a bad resume format and to PM me with it so I could review it for them, and about 50 other redditors ended up sending me their resumes to review. I don't have time to do all of them, so I decided to write this post and share a [downloadable editable Word doc resume format](https://sheetsgiggles.com/template) in the hope that it fulfills my personal obligations (*note: delete the footer before sending out!*). Here's a [preview](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y5sHcAI) of the resume.\n\nI'll keep it short and sweet, and hopefully many of you find this useful.\n\n---\n\n*Source: This quick excerpt is from a longer [blog on my website](https://sheetsgiggles.com/blogs/news/sheets-and-giggles-fastest-growing-startup-in-colorado). My company ([Sheets & Giggles](https://sheetsgiggles.com)) makes sustainable eucalyptus bedding, so this is a little out there.*\n\n---\n\n**General resume advice:**\n\n* Use a professional-looking gmail, outlook, or personal domain email address. Delete your hotmail with extreme prejudice.\n\n* Don't put an objective section or summary. It'll be skipped, and it's space that can be used better.\n\n* Unless you have 20+ years' experience, make it 1 page. You can do it.\n\n* Don't put your full address. \""City, State\"" is enough.\n\n* Name your resume \""\u200bFirstName LastName Resume\"" and that's it. Never submit it with \""(Project Management)\"" or \""Final\"" or \""2018\"" or literally anything else in the file name.\n\n* If emailing your resume, always submit it as a PDF, never as a Word doc. You never know how wonky a Word doc will look on someone else's machine. If uploading to an online application that uses resume parsing software, you can upload the Word doc as well or if it's required to do so.\n\n* Try to read it in 10 seconds or less and see what you take away from it. That's about the initial screen time before someone makes an initial up/down decision, so you'll want to examine it from that perspective.\n\n* Interests are important because it gives the interviewer something to connect with you on, and it makes you more than just a faceless resume. If you put Seinfeld, I promise someone will ask you what your favorite episode of Seinfeld is (mine's the Soup Nazi).\n\nThat's the most important stuff. [Here's that resume template download link again](https://sheetsgiggles.com/template). If you have more questions about job hunting, resumes, or career advice in general, just PM me and I'll try to get back to you before long.\n\n**Edit:** damn, thanks for the gold! Super glad this advice is helping so many people; the comments have totally made my day.\n\n**Edit 2:** out and about so trying to respond to everyone on mobile, but it's slow going. I'll get back to all questions in comments asap.\n\n**Edit 3:** my inbox is ruined, but having a blast helping everyone with their specific questions.

Lots of PMs to sort through too!\n\n**Edit 5:** See how clean those sheets are?

Hit me up anytime with your job hunting questions.\n\n**Wednesday edit:** over the last few days, I've responded to probably 500+ combined questions in the comments and PMs. PMs still rolling in.

Who cares if that person is stressed out? Business is still running as usual and will hold out as long as they can. By not hiring more and keeping the headcount low, profit goes up and whoever is in the upper management gets a nice bonus.\n2. **False Hiring and PPP Loans.** Ranging from small businesses to large corporations, many have received Payment Protection Program (PPP) Loans that were supposed to be used for payroll and other expenses during the pandemic. However, many of the loans were abused and pocketed by owners and then later forgiven. A condition for these loans to be forgiven is if a company is \""actively\"" trying to hire but cannot fulfill these positions. That's why people are struggling to get interviews as well as seeing jobs being posted over and over again. They had no intention to hire in the first place. Basically, it was a huge money transfer and the top ate well.\n3. **Everyone is hiring.** No, they are not. Only retail and fast food positions that barely pay a living wage and high stressed are only hiring is what they mean. Not the comfy white-collar jobs with good benefits cause who would give that up? Even then, these places are running on skeleton crews as well.\n4. **Mass Layoffs.** You have now a lot of people including whom have more than 12+ years of experience looking for jobs now. A good chunk of them are willing to take lower-paying jobs because they have no choice but to put food on the table and pay bills. Now the entry-level or junior-level position you are applying for has become more competitive. Employers have the luxury to be picky and want a unicorn to be a yes man, a bootlicker, someone who does not talk back, who is overqualified, and willing to take a pay cut as well. Also, a lot of these companies have a \""monkey see monkey do\"" mentality. Once a couple of companies started doing layoffs, then other companies started doing it only because \""it must be the right thing to do right now\""\n5. **The Feds actually want unemployment to go up.** They want it to go up because the justification is that no job = no money = reduction in savings = lower purchasing power = reduction in inflation. Higher interest rates would lead more people to hold off on purchases they do not need which put less money in circulation and bring down inflation according to the federal government. Also, Powell said it is to \""discipline labor\"" as well. But of course, there isn't a problem with corporations making record profits during high periods of inflation. It is estimated that 70% of inflation came from price gouging in which corporations raised the price more than they needed to and mask it as inflation. Anything but to tax the rich right? I'm sure trickle-down will happen anytime soon.\n6. **Anti- WFH Propaganda.** Throughout the pandemic, multiple reports proved that WFH has increased productivity and worker well-being that has not been seen pre-pandemic. WFH was positively received. But all of a sudden Return-to-Office was necessary as WFH wasn't working even though as long you have a computer, desk, and WI-FI, the same work that can be done at the office, can be done better from home in most people's cases. This is later revealed that a lot of bigger players are tied up in real-estate investment of these corporate buildings and that tax revenue around the surrounding areas has decreased as well which the local government does not like.  If you WFH, there is no need to buy food on the way to work or buy expensive lunch downtown, and then waste money on gas. However, with the big RTO push, a lot of employees are either resigning or outright refusing because why would you go backward on quality of life?  I even was disqualified from an interview for asking about remote policy but it is what it is. Remote work is in hot demand yet employers refuse to acknowledge it.\n\nThere's more to why the job market is trash right now of course but this is JMO from all the reports and posts I have been reading.

This is why after a negative review is left, a company will routinely leave an onslaught of positive reviews to counterweight the negative one. Glassdoor is trash.\n\nAlso, some valuable nomenclature: an [*Active*](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/5-things-can-free-employer-account/) employer is one that uses the platform to respond to reviews and maybe some other trivial touchpoint engagement. An *Engaged* employer may be one that pays for the service. I'm inferring from the subtle threat in Glassdoor's own [content](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/opening-the-glassdoor-a-wise-move/).\n\n**EDIT 2**: Some people are pointing out that their algorithm had detected an identical review was submitted, which was the reason for my getting banned. Problem is, I didn't leave a second review. Like I said, the original review was live for 2 months and then it was removed for the reasons cited.\n\n**Original**: For the past few years, I've often defended Glassdoor as a useful resource as part of any job-seeker's overall job-seeking toolkit. \n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I interviewed with a company that had horrendous reviews. Literally, all 15 reviews were 1-star and for the same reasons. So in the interviews, I brought up some of the themes. The hiring manager, a decent man, admitted to all of it and said he was desperately and single-handedly trying to change those issues. So in this case, the negative reviews weren't a bunch of bitter employees; they were actual experiences and issues.\n\nI elected to join the company based on this honesty and the prospect of a challenge, and of course, it was exactly like how all those reviews had said it would be. It was awful. I was thankfully laid off due to COVID.\n\nAfter being laid off, I left a very detailed, thorough, cutting review that within a week of being posted, had 6 'helpful' upvotes or whatever. After two months, the review was removed suddenly for violating guidelines and so was every review I had ever written. Incredulous, I reached out to Glassdoor's content management team. They would not tell me exactly what the issue was, just that I was banned from participating in their community. Finally, a service manager emailed me to say they had some proprietary algorithm that had detected language that was in violation of Glassdoor's guidelines. To be clear, I didn't use any community guideline-violating language. Apparently, they detected an identical review had been written elsewhere.\n\n*I have a close family member that works for Glassdoor. I spoke to this person and found out that a very recent strategic repositioning for Glassdoor is that they are trying to become a PR company of sorts, so they are focusing on brand management for companies. As a result, they are getting very aggressive with negative review-takedowns while allowing very obviously fraudulent positive reviews to remain the same.*\n\nThis same company from which I was laid off, from June-August, posted 10 5-star reviews, each of which was of similar length, all with just about the same thing to say. Cliches like, \""great culture\"", \""build your skills\"", \""enlightened management\"", \""cool tech\"", \""takes care of employees\"". I reached out to Glassdoor and asked them to use their \""proprietary algorithm\"" to see if there was any fraud in that content, to which they said no, there was no violation.\n\nSo, what I'm getting at: with Glassdoor's supposed strategic pivot to brand management, it is becoming even less reliable than it was before.""",A Warning About Glassdoor,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jbod57/a_warning_about_glassdoor/,2020-10-15 14:16:35,October,2020

I don't have too many people I can talk about this with, so I just wanted to share the news with someone. I work in software, and my current pay is $75k per year. The short version of my past few years is that I dropped out of college and have been making $45k/ year for a while pre-COVID. From there, 2020 hit me really hard. I was unemployed for about 6 months. I was looking for $18/hour jobs, then I got an opportunity in software sales. I started at a base salary of $50k per year. I got promoted once and then moved over to operations within my company, and my salary went up to $75k (where it is now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving been at my current company for 3 years, I've known that I was underpaid compared to the market for a while, so I started looking a few months ago. I applied to this job that's a manager-level position, which is one level above my current role. I had my final round interview at this company last week and it went pretty well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe hiring manager set some time with me yesterday afternoon. When we hopped on the call, we talked for a few minutes before she offered me the job! $120k per year! In the moment, I didn't react much outwardly or inwardly beyond being pleasant and expressing thankfulness and excitement about the offer. I was trying to keep my hand close to my vest I suppose. I ended up thanking her and agreeing to follow up on Monday after I had the weekend to think about it (as I was in the process of a few other interviews as well). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the hour after we hopped off Zoom, I didn't feel much. Then the offer letter hit my inbox. Seeing $120,000 in black and white is when it hit me. $10,000/month. I broke down and started crying. That's more money than I've ever made before by a long shot. I wanted to call my dad and tell him because I know that he'd be proud. He died in 2020, so I got hit with a wave of emotions from excitement to relief, to grief hitting me super hard. I've had a lot of money stress over the past few years, and this feels like a game changer. I'm hoping that this will accelerate my ability to build up savings and I want to be smart with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's my ramble. Thanks for listening. Today I'm excited and am looking forward to accepting on Monday.

The majority of data does not support in office work vs remote work. Companies were the most profitable they have ever been during the pandemic. Yes, that was also caused by an endless supply of helicopter money, but also because worker engagement was up a ridiculous amount. For me personally, I have never worked as hard as I have during the last few years, and I am fully remote.\n\nThe REAL reason for all these stupid articles is the commercial real estate situation. Companies are losing money (on paper) because their real estate values have all declined. Forcing employees back to the office would create more demand for surrounding homes/businesses, and affectively raise their portfolio value.\n\nThe other reason is control. The C-Suites job is to \""inspire\"". They don't feel a sense of purpose without having you, the worker bee, around for them to view. They want to see you building their pyramid for them, even if it can be done remotely and more efficiently. It's a psychological thing that sociopaths in the C-Suite need. They're losing control, and they want to have it back to be more valuable since their perceived value is about steering the ship and not contributing anything meaningful.\n\nJust wanted to share and vent because I'm sick of this narrative. Remember the truth and ALWAYS bring it up.\n\nEDIT: Wow...I didn't expect to get this many responses. I just wanted to add that yes, there is frustration in my voice. I'm tired. I'm tired of the constant squeeze corporations apply to all of us daily. It's always happened throughout history, but it is MUCH worse now. Profit over People has never been more rampant then it is now. \n\nThe truth is, I believe this country is in desperate need of a workers rights movement. I would LOVE to see every talented individual out there push back against this RTO narrative that is solely based off \""a gut feeling\"" from a handful of people. I'm just tired of being lied to, and it's a constant fight to keep the truth alive.\n\nAlso, to everyone that is saying things like \""suck it up and deal with it\"", you're part of the problem. That dismissive attitude means you aren't open to change, and just accept things the way they are.

I was a little bit in panic mode by then. During the first 2-3 months I applied to literally every single PM job offer I saw but I didn\u2019t even pass the second interview. Then a friend explained to me the 3-stage process she used to find her job. She also recommended a few AI tools that ended up being very useful. \n\nAfter 2 months of following her guidelines, I was offered 2 positions! 1 of them with a higher salary than the one I had in my previous company (ironically I took the other one, but for different reasons).   \nI learned that finding a new job is a job in itself. You improve with practice and by failing. So the 3-stage process is designed to iterate fast. In every stage, I focused on \u201cMastering that stage only\u201d and improving on 1 metric:\n\n**Stage 1 Iterate my Resume**\n\nMy main focus in this stage was to improve the conversion rate of my resume. The metric I used was the % of responses I received. I kept refining and tweaking my resume until I achieved a solid ratio. I started with less than a 5% response rate (from *resume sent* to *first interview scheduled*). \n\nIn a shell I did this:\n\n* Adapt my resume for every position (I used a few tools, mostly kickresume explained below).\n* When describing my previous experience, rephrase it using the exact key words used in the job offer. A lot of companies use software to filter resumes, so if they don\u2019t find certain keywords, you are automatically rejected.\n* Create a cover letter \u201ctemplate\u201d and leave some paragraphs to modify depending on each company.\n* I created a notion page with a more detailed resume, with links to previous projects and a lot of details about me. I added this when asked for a \u201cWebsite URL\u201d (asked in many offers).\n\nOnce I started getting first interviews with HR managers or hiring managers (1st interview), I shifted my attention to preparing and improving my interview skills.  \n\n\n**Stage 2 First interviews (usually with HR)**\n\nIn this stage, I aimed to increase the number of second interviews or technical exercises I was offered. This was a critical step in progressing further in the hiring process. I made sure to thoroughly prepare for these initial interviews, showcasing my skills and experiences effectively and I used a few tools (below) to practice my interviews.\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked the same questions again and again in these interviews with HR. With Otter you can transcript the meetings. So I created a document with \""Hard Questions in Job Interviews\"" as a quick reference during interviews. I have the answers written there for all the typical questions. If you do online meetings, you can keep the doc open on your second screen \ud83d\ude1b\n\n  \n **3 Use case (or technical exercise)**\n\nMy metric here was the number of job offers I received. This stage varies a lot depending on your role. I was applying for Product Manager, in case you are also applying for this role let me know and I can give you some examples of exercises I prepared in advance\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Here are the tools that played a significant role in that process: \n\n **1 ChatGPT - Turned into a job interview trainer** \n\n You start by training ChatGPT on your resume. You can use this prompt:\n\n>As ChatGPT, you\u2019ll be participating in an interview simulation for the position of Product Manager at \\_\\_\\_\\_. I\u2019ll provide you with your Resume in an upcoming message. Following that, you\u2019ll receive the interview questions along with guidelines on how to respond. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Then you copy&Paste your CV on ChatGPT. And you give it this new prompt:\n\n>The focus of this interview will be on your soft skills. When answering questions be clear and concise, using everyday language. Create convincing responses that an interviewer would appreciate even if they are fictional. However, ensure that your answers align with the experiences mentioned in your resume. \n\nThen ask ChatGPT the interview questions you may get and it will be generating perfect responses to any question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **2 kickresume.com**  \n\nUse it to improve your resume. You can do several things with it. Start your resume from scratch or modify one, create your cover letter with AI (it uses ChatGPT on the backend), or ask for feedback on your resume. I still needed to do a lot of manual changes in the version it creates but it is a great start. For cover letters, which can be quite a hassle to customize for each job application, it was a real-time-saver. Another option is Rezi, I haven\u2019t tried it yet but it looks promising. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **3 Wave.ai** \n\nIt provided a written conversation with a real human coach, utilizing AI to offer guidance and assistance. The coaching sessions helped me develop habits for finding the right jobs and mentally preparing for interviews. I used it a lot in stage 2. I would go to Wave with the answers I replied on every interview and they would help me improve them with feedback. Ultimately, they also helped me negotiate the offers. I\u2019m so bad at facing conflict and asking for a higher salary, that my first instinct when I was offered the first job was to say OMG OF COURSE. I was able to raise the salary a bit and also the stock options they gave to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **4 Otter.ai** \n\nYou can use it during your online meetings to take notes. During job interviews, it is not only important the content of your answer, but also how your answer is structured. And the only way to improve this is by practicing. With this tool,  I could review the questions asked and my responses, allowing me to refine and better structure my answers. Write down your answers and then use ChatGPT to improve them and structure them in a way that is easier to understand! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **5 Interview Warmup (from Google)** \n\nSimilar use to the first one with ChatGPT but in this case they ask you the questions. It simulates a real interview and gives you personalized feedback based on your responses. It can help you identify areas where you need to improve. Also, by practicing with these tools, I felt more confident and prepared for those higher-stakes real interviews.\n\n \n\nI hope this is helpful to you!\n\nAny other tool I should add?""",I found a remote job in 2 months using AI tools and a 3-stage preparation process,0.9500000000000001,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13uxdwu/i_found_a_remote_job_in_2_months_using_ai_tools/,2023-05-29 15:04:55,May,2023

I also had just bought a house and spent a chunk of savings on renovations. \n\nA recruiter hits me up and mentions a big salary increase at their company. I figured sure why not talk to them. I had 2 calls and next was to be with the founder. Turns out the founder knew the CEO of my company. He called my CEO and said I was looking around. I was immediately fired with no severance. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve sent out thousands of applications and had tons of interviews. Most companies had 4+ rounds. 3 months later I get an offer but instead of remote like they initially said, they wanted me to work in their office on the other side of the country for six months before going remote. I turned it down figuring another offer would come soon. It didn\u2019t. \n\n I\u2019ve dealt with horrible hiring managers, a couple examples is one asked me about my parents occupations and then turned me down saying they wanted someone who grew up around success so they knew what it looked like. one company had me write a blog as part of the process and months after being ghosted by them I found my blog on their website. I won\u2019t even get into being ghosted, hiring managers showing up late or not at all. \n\nI thought my journey finally came to an end. I accepted an offer. It was 40% less than what they originally said they would pay. I\u2019d also have to travel by train 2 hours each day but I was desperate so I took it. \n\nOn Friday I was informed my offer was rescinded due to restructuring and they won\u2019t reimburse me on my $300 a month train package I had just bought to travel to work. \n\nMy old company is thriving and my old colleagues are still doing well in spite of the market. \n\nMeanwhile I\u2019m out of savings and unemployment ran out a while ago. My house that I was very proud of is now up for sale. my wife who was initially supportive has also now left me saying I can\u2019t provide for her and doesn\u2019t understand how it could be so hard to get a job. \n\nTomorrow I have an interview at a gas station.""",A year ago today I made a mistake that ruined my life,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/19evxmr/a_year_ago_today_i_made_a_mistake_that_ruined_my/,2024-01-25 00:21:08,January,2024

Noirradnod,1505050356,,,124,6z88pl,3876,LegalAdviceOffTopic,"""Experimental evidence contradicting OP's claim of semen on the exterior of a motor vehicle.\n\n**The Facts** \nSix days ago u//Fuzzpuffs posted [a thread](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6xykeb/someone_has_been_masturbating_next_to_my_vehical/) in r//legaladvice that she believed their neighbor had been engaged in a transgressive sexual act, namely ejaculating multiple times onto the rear driver's side door of OP's car. As evidence, she provided a picture of off-white material on the door as well as testimony that the material glowed under UV light. She further stated that she \""just knows how perverts are\"" and that the residue was at waist height. Lastly, she claimed that, because she resides in a hot and arid locale, it was unlikely to be caused by some natural liquid event.\n\n**Response**\nPosters in the thread tended to be dismissive of the claims for several reasons. First. many provided personal experience with a variety of other fluids, including puddles on the road, lawn sprinklers, tree sap, and bird excrement, all of which have left splash patterns and residues similar to the provided picture. To counter the UV claim, especially in light of the CSI trope that bodily fluids glow under this light, it was pointed out that numerous other substances exhibit similar fluorescence, including some of the alternative suggested causes. There was also a professed belief that dried semen does not take on the depicted form. Finally, questions were raised regarding the plausibility of the action, as despite massive evidence that extreme sexual perversions do exist (cf. *United States vs. One Book Called Ulysses*), it was hard to fathom someone gaining sexual pleasure from this particular act. Despite this rejection, OP remained steadfastly devoted to their claim.\n\nAs such, I felt that it would be necessary to provide more evidence against this belief. To this end, I engaged\nin several masturbatory events with a car to create a visual record of what ejaculate on a car door looks\nlike.\n\n**Experimental methodology** \nThe subject is a young adult male with no history of sexual dysfunction. To guarantee a large volume of the ejaculate, subject refrained from release for a period of four days prior to the test. Furthermore, normal diet was supplemented with extra water to guarantee hydration and eight stalks of celery, which anecdotally is claimed to increase semen production. The exact experiment consisted of three sessions, spaced four hours apart, conducted in a chair and concluded by standing and ejaculating onto a car's door. Subject was provided approximately two teaspoons of lubricant per session, and all external stimulation was limited to a January 2013 Penthouse magazine. The results were photographed until the ejaculate dried.\n\n[Pictures Here](https://imgur.com/a/yUV9T)\n\n**Conclusion**\nThis album contains the original pictures of OP as well as the results of the experiment. As can be seen, there is a noticeable difference between the appearance of what was claimed to be semen and what actually is semen. Therefore, it is very doubtful that anyone masturbated onto OP's car, and it can be assumed that some other substance is the cause of the residue.\n""",That was probably not jizz on OP's car,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/6z88pl/that_was_probably_not_jizz_on_ops_car/,2017-09-10 13:32:36,September,2017

probonolawyer2017,1513377592,,,422,7k37fj,2220,LegalAdviceOffTopic,"""Somebody suggested I post about my issue on this subreddit. \n\nI recently graduated law school and started working at a non-profit firm, providing free legal services to low income individuals.\n\nI always wanted to work in either government or non-profit, as I always believed in St. Thomas' principles of helping others. However, it has turned to be a complete headache.\n\nThe clients are driving me nuts!\n \nThe main problem is the walk ins. \nThey walk-in every day without appointments, and expect me to stop what I am doing to help them. One who expected me to stop during my appointment I had with another client to help her. I will have up to five walk ins in one day. The problem with the constant walk ins is that the receptionist speaks English, and does not speak Spanish, so if they walk in I have to be the one who speaks to them. With the constant walk ins, I have to be a part-time receptionist. The constant walk ins burn me out by the end the day. Additionally, it is hard for me to get the other work I have done if I have to play receptionist all day.\n\nMy second problem is how many \""no show\"" appointments I have. I can understand if somebody calls and cancels in advance because of work schedules fluctuate and I'm usually understanding,  but some literally do not show up. Two or three times. It's frustrating because it not only delays finishing up their case, but it takes time away that I could be helping another person. \n\nThe third problem is when I give them a list of documents they *need* to bring to the next appointment in order to do the next part, and they don't bring them, and then they have to come back multiple times to finish. I have assignments that should have finished in one day that take two months to finish.  It makes the process completely slow and all the extra time I am taking to finish these cases, it makes the entire system slow. \n\nIt's complete inefficiency and it makes the job not just hard but frustrating.  I am always burnt out by the end of the day. \n\nLastly, while most of my clients are wonderful, some of them are rude. One lady sucked her teeth at me when I told her that it was out of my job description to get her an info pass appointment (I'd have to get up at 5 am to try to get her an open slot). I called another lady back and she said: \""It took you guys that long to call me back?\"" I'm putting 110% in my cases, and put hours and hours in a case to make sure they get the best representation, so it is shocking that my effort is so undervalued to them. \n\nMaybe I was naive to think there would always be some form of appreciation because a private lawyer would cost thousands of dollars, money that they cannot afford. \n\nAny advice on how to go about with pro-bono clients and serving a low income population?\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for the responses. I have been thinking about this all night and it really opened my eyes. Now that I think about it, some of my clients are not just poor, but the poorest of the poor. They are adults, but in reality they're like children. The social norms that we know about appointments, etc., they may not have had the opportunity to learn. \n\nWith all that in mind, I am starting to believe I am not cut out for his, no matter how good my intentions are.  I am burnt out after only 3 1/2 months. \n\nMy only concern is, if and when it is time for me to leave, who helps these people?  And if people are constantly leaving non-profit, who helps these people?""",Pro-bono clients are driving me mad.

My three children (14M, 16F, and 18M) I had with my ex-wife had been living with me for almost 10 years at the time of this story. Our custody was technically joint, but the military moved me out to the other side of the country, so the reality was that they lived with me except for Christmas, Spring, and Summer breaks. \n\nOur oldest graduated at the very end of May and my ex and her parents flew out to CA for the graduation. She was coolly cordial, which was the nicest she'd been to me in years. I thought things were turning around and that we could be maybe be friendly again. Well, a couple of weeks later, there was a knock at my door and it was a summons for a custody hearing in SC less than a week away.\n\nObviously, I was panicked because I'd have to arrange for PTO, plane tickets, lodging, etc. just to make it to the hearing in time.

What she did, instead, was to pull the county's family court roster for the county where this action was filed. She made note of whose names popped up the most and we started working our way down that list. Her thought being that these lawyers not only handled family court issues, but were in front of those judges on a regular basis. They'd know the judges and the judges would know them. One of the top three got back to us for a consult. During the consult he asked, \""So how did you find me?\"" My wife explained her method and reasoning and his response was \""Wow. That's really smart.\"" He took the case and we won.\n\nI often see the advice to lawyer up immediately, but if it hadn't been for my wife's real-world knowledge of the court system I would have been lost about how to find a good lawyer in time.

RFGunner,1684234945,f54d73ce-28b9-11ec-bd91-1eac593353f0,I'm sharing advice,360,13j1ztu,1618,resumes,"""I've been helping people on this subreddit for months and have seen people use terrible off-the-wall templates for non-art related jobs and figured those that have been successful and getting interviews and jobs should start sharing what their [resume](https://imgur.com/a/v96Luz8) looked like to get them to that position.   \n\n\nI used this format to apply to about 8 jobs. Of those 8, 6 emailed me within days of applying for an interview. A CEO of a small contracting company also reached out to me when I added my resume on Monster. I'm not saying my resume is perfect (looking at it now, there are small things I want to change on it), and I'm not trying to brag. I just want to show that I must have done something correctly to just about get an interview anytime I applied, and I think it is because my resume is ATS-friendly and not cluttered.\n\nSo here is ONE of the resumes I created. Note that I actually made multiple resumes. For those that just made ONE resume and are trying to shotgun it to every job listing you see on Linkedin, or any other job board and have not heard a peep from any company, You might want to reevaluate our approach. You should be tailoring your resume to the job post. The Wiki mentions this, I believe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone would like, I can go over how exactly I created my resume according to the job post, either here on in a separate post.\n\nNow I will explain my resume format:\n\n**TITLE**\n\nThe title of your resume should be your job title. Plumber, Senior Electrician, Front-end developer, McDonald's Shift Lead, whatever. Generally, it's something people can understand from reading alone. My job title is what I had in the military and I couldn't think of a better one to use to cover all the radio things I've worked on so I kept it in. Normally the job title is also what you are applying for.\n\n**Summary**\n\nSummaries are supposed to be a short 3-5 line \""elevator pitch\"". I strongly recommend you use a summary as it helps highlight and explain who you are and what you provide to the company. After I finished my interviews, I asked what helped my resume stand out and everyone said it was my summary. It's a little long, but I wanted to capture just exactly what I work on and also tailor it to the job post I was applying for. \\*Notice how I DO NOT have personal pronouns in my summary.\\*\n\n**Hard Skills**\n\nSo the section with bullet points is where I put my hard skills.  Hard skills are abilities that let you tackle job-specific duties and responsibilities. Hard skills can be learned and are job specific. They are NOT personality traits such as hardworking, organized, or time management. Those type of skills belong in a summary, in my opinion. You DO NOT type out a sentence for each skill. I keep seeing new people try to write a paragraph for each skill trying to explain how they got it or how they demonstrated it. Ideally, your work bullets will reflect some of these hard skills. A job post will have some listed that you can add if you're paying attention. I have slightly different summaries on my other resumes as well.\n\n**Certifications**\n\nThis field all depends on your career field. I cannot tell you what certifications you need. You should know what certification your career field requires or wants. If you don't know, start researching.  If you do have a certification, you just put the name of the cert, followed by the company that issued it and then the year you obtained it. That's it. If it is expired, renew it or remove it from your resume.\n\n**Professional Experience**\n\nNothing out of the ordinary here. I have the company I worked for (United States Air Force) and the location. I then have my job titles under it because my duties changed over the years as I promoted and moved to other locations. Your most recent job should have the most work bullets. Your oldest job and shortest job should have the least. YOUR JOB BULLETS SHOULD REFLECT THE JOB POST. If the job post is talking about working with or interacting with customers, you should mention something like this in your resume. Same for Engineers and developers. Again, creating bullets about an art project when you are applying to be a plumber makes no sense and should not be on there. \n\n**EDUCATION**\n\nThis is self explanatory. List the degree relevant to the job. A Master's degree in underwater basket weaving isn't going to do you any favors when applying to manage projects or write code. The job post will mention what degree the company is looking for as well as how much experience you need for them to waive not having a B.S. degree or M.A. degree. Some companies are very strict about it and will throw your resume away if it doesn't meet their requirements.\n\n**Technical Competencies**\n\nThis is where I would list things that I work with and am competent using. Here is where the specific radio equipment I've worked on will be listed as well as other equipment. For Networking personnel, this is where you mention the Cisco Switch, cable testers, Linux operating systems, and other things. You could also use this section for languages (code and spoken languages), software, or just anything you are competent with. THE JOB POST TELLS YOU WHAT THE COMPANY IS LOOKING FOR.   \n\n\nAs I said before, this is only one of my resumes, but the format is exactly the same for all of them, even the master resume I pull my bullets from. My resume itself isn't perfect, but I believe it is easy to read and can give some new people writing a resume an idea of how a good one can or should look like. I currently have a job so I am not too focused on fixing up my resume write now, but I will add on to it over the years and tweak it every now and then so I am ready in case I need to use it again.    \n\n\nFeel free to let me know your thoughts and I will be happy if I can help at least one person on here. Job search isn't always easy, and I want to help everyone succeed as long as they are willing to put in the work. Sorry in advance for typos, I'm just getting off shift and about to go drive home.""",This Resume Got Me Interviews and A Job In Two Weeks,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/13j1ztu/this_resume_got_me_interviews_and_a_job_in_two/,2023-05-16 11:02:25,May,2023

FinalDraftResumes,1648438009,f54d73ce-28b9-11ec-bd91-1eac593353f0,I'm sharing advice,85,tq061t,1445,resumes,"""Hello Team,\n\nAs a regular contributor to this sub, a professional resume writer, and former corporate recruiter, I'd like to share the most common mistakes I see folks make. \n\nThis isn't an exhaustive list and isn't in any particular order. These are big mistakes that are potentially causing you to lose out on valuable opportunities and correcting them *should* improve the overall performance of your job search.\n\n# #1 Using the wrong layout\n\nThere's already another stickied post on this subject, but I still see people committing this mistake all the time. In short, don't use a two-column resume if you're submitting through company websites or job boards (i.e., Indeed, LinkedIn etc.).\n\n**Why?**\n\n**Short answer**: Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)\n\n**Longer Answer**: ATS reads your resume from top to bottom and left to right. When you add another column (or other incompatible elements for that matter, such as graphics or logos), you introduce another layer of complexity and make it harder for the system to properly read your resume. As a result, sections may get misread or not read all.\n\nUse a traditional, single-column format. I recommend creating your resume using Microsoft Word or Google Docs. There\u2019s a basic Google Docs template in the wiki section of this sub - I\u2019ll link it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wdkgpgU7lFoV801ysrBn8qrPaIpyUsUH/mobilebasic) for your convenience. \n\nI do not recommend using other programs such as Canva, Adobe InDesign, or Overleaf (LaTeX).\n\n# #2 Writing generic content\n\nTo begin, let me first define the term '**context**' which is going to be key here. Context is specific information that makes your resume and the descriptions within it unique to you. It allows the reader to understand and appreciate your story. A resume with zero context will sound generic - a lot like a job advertisement. Here's an extreme example:\n\nGeneric Statement:  \""*Achieved excellent sales results*\"".\n\nSpecific/Contextualized Statement:  \""*Earned top spot in the company's 2019 national sales rankings for achieving 220% against annual sales target*\"".\n\nThe second statement is much more informative and tells the audience not only what the achievement was, but also why it was earned. This is a good example of how you can use context to ensure your descriptions are quantified, specific, and informative.\n\nIn general, a good description will address three informational goals:\n\n* A **challenge** or problem to be solved. This doesn't always need to be explicitly stated. For example, in the second statement in quotes above, the problem is implied - to meet and exceed sales goals and rank high as possible on the sales charts.\n* The **action**(s) you took to address that challenge. What did YOU do specifically. I don't care what your team or your boss did.\n* An **outcome** that resulted as a direct result of your actions. What did your actions produce? It doesn't always need to be a monumental, earth-shattering impact, but it does need to be there.\n\n# #3 Failing to curate your resume to your targeted role\n\nIf you were to walk into your local car dealership looking for an off-road vehicle for travelling through muddy terrain and the salesperson tries to sell you on a two-door Volkswagen beetle, you'd think they weren't very good at their job.\n\nSo why would you do that to a prospective employer? By submitting a resume for a role it wasn't written for, you're demonstrating one of two things:\n\n* You don't understand the requirements of role you're applying for, OR\n* You're too lazy to tailor your resume to the role.\n\nBoth of these are equally bad and often result in being ignored by the company.\n\n**How do you tailor your resume to the job?**\n\n* Step 1: Read the job posting carefully. Identify what they're looking for in terms of experience/responsibilities, skills, licenses/certifications, and education.\n* Step 2: Put yourself in the recruiter's shoes. How quickly can you identify any given prerequisite from the job advertisement on your resume? Is it easily identifiable or do you need to dig in for several moments to find it?\n* Step 3: Does the language used in your resume match that in the job description? Are you using the same terms?\n\nExample 1: Company A is requesting at least 5 years of experience doing X.  Your summary (if you include one) would begin by saying 'X Professional with 5+ years of experience in X'.\n\nExample 2: Company B is requesting CPR, AED, ACLS, and PALS certifications. You would include a section labelled as 'Certifications' and list these (exactly as they're presented in the ad).\n\n# DON'T DO THIS\n\n* Copy and paste the job description into your resume - it's very easy to spot and is disingenuous.\n* Lie and/or embellish your accomplishments. You may get away with it, but if a clever hiring manager puts you on the spot, it'll be obvious (In my experience as a recruiter, I was privy to many of these situations during interviews and it doesn't look good - trust me).\n\nI hope you guys find this useful!""",Biggest mistakes that impact your resume's performance and how to fix them,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/tq061t/biggest_mistakes_that_impact_your_resumes/,2022-03-28 03:26:49,March,2022

Either choose quality or quantity when applying or some of both. I find myself doing both usually -- investing time into tailoring a resume for dream positions and \""easy applying\"" to others. To be picky is a luxury -- I realize this. But it's also nice to confirm that 100+ apps aren't all being tailored, despite what I see people advise others to do. There's really no harm in sending out resumes en masse, since getting through to offer seems so unpredictable anyway.

ExecutiveDrafts,1570463463,,,32,delb19,506,resumes,"""Hello all,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's been a while since I've made a stand-alone post to address some things I see happening in the job-searching and resume writing world, so I thought I'd pop in with a post just for Reddit.  There's no website link, there's no pitch to our services, it's just a list of things you can think about and act on to improve your resume and job searching strategies. I hope some folks find it helpful as we move into a tricky part of the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As I mentioned, this is a tricky part of the year for a job transition. Most people have until just after Thanksgiving to get a job offer. After that, things slow to a crawl. Folks are out of the office, spending time with their families, and companies are waiting to approve head count after reviewing their quarterly and annual earnings.  These things put together means very little hiring happens. To compound it, many people want to \""hold off\"" on the job search so they can enjoy the holidays. What ends up happening? January is a hiring fiesta and people scramble to prepare their resumes once they return to work and realize they're not so happy with their jobs.  This means you should either make a mad rush to get hired right now, or you should start updating your resume and job searching approach in preparation for the January rush.  If you're prepared now, you will be one step ahead of people when the new year hits.\n* One of the most common resume mistakes I see is when people aren't thinking about how their resume looks to a person trying to hire them.  This sounds simple, but clearly presents challenges to people.  I am currently hiring an administrative position at Executive Drafts, and I've had well over 400 applications in only a few weeks.  Of those 400 applications, I'd say over half of them make no sense to me whatsoever (their careers are completely unrelated, they seem grossly overqualified, and/or they make no attempt at explaining to me the reason for their transition or interest, either in the summary or a cover letter).  It baffles me that someone with a Ph.D. or C-level experience would apply to an administrative assistant position at my company without even giving a slight reason for the obvious mismatch, and so those people are not going to get a callback.  If you are making a career transition, or if you're looking to take a lateral or downward step in your career, you need to be careful how you phrase things, specific about your job titles, and provide a brief but tactful explanation. In short, your story needs to make sense, because there's always another resume behind yours and we don't have time to call everyone and figure out what's going on with their career aspirations.\n* Any decent job gets a ton of applications, which means you need to get the right tools in place (Resume, LinkedIn, etc.) and then you need to run the numbers.  It is very hard to go after one specific job and get it, and it's very hard to go after 100 jobs with a crappy resume and get anything at all. The sweet spot is in the middle: Get the right tools, then keep your activity levels high.  I know this can vary based on your urgency, your specific career, etc., but I think anyone serious about getting a new job should aim for around 10-15 applications a week. This ensures you can give each one proper care (making small revisions from job to job, for example). People who apply to 2 jobs a week, as well as those applying to 50+, are both showing different bad habits with the same disappointing outlook.\n* Standing out isn't an effective strategy. So many of our clients ask how they can stand out better to recruiters. One thing I've learned over and over again is that recruiters aren't stupid and they don't fall for tricks. A lavender scented resume with glitter stands out, but isn't likely to get you hired.  Extensive graphical design elements aren't effective in the long run.  Eye-popping catch phrases don't work.  Mostly, we're looking to filter out obviously unqualified folks, and then we're hoping to find someone who seems like they understand how to write professionally, they've done the kind of work we're looking for, and they \""fit in\"".  I wish the bad advice wouldn't circulate as often as it does, but maybe this is why our clients end up with an advantage.  You are far better off showing yourself as a strong match for the job than finding a way to \""stand out\"".\n* People are often frustrated when transitioning careers because they're so sure they can do the job, and they just need an employer to take a chance on them.  In a perfect world with plenty of opportunity, this sounds totally fair.  However, employers aren't looking to be mean and deny you an opportunity. Rather, it's a simple matter of \""Do I take this person, who has worked as a server for six years and wants to be a customer success agent, or do I take this person, who has worked in customer service for six years and customer success for two?\""  Employers can usually find people who have already done the job they're hiring for.  This is where networking helps. This is where freelancing or contract work helps. This is where temp services can be helpful.  Sometimes, it's even a good strategy to take a position that might pay less if it offers you a doorway into a new career path. You can always re-evaluate in 12 months and apply for a role at the same company or an entirely different one, now that you have experience.  I meet so many people who say \""I really don't want to take a lateral move.\"" Yeah, nobody does. But sometimes that can be the best decision you've ever made.  I know so many people who want to transition out of sales roles and into something else in the corporate world, but are afraid of losing a few thousand dollars a year. Commission jobs tend to pay well, and if you want to give up that stressful sales quota and work as a project manager, it's probably a good idea to take even money to re-establish your experience.\n* Let's talk about something a little less heady: Skills sections. I would say the average person has a skills section on his resume, but the average person probably doesn't need one. Highly technical positions benefit from a \""Technical Skills\"" section. However, many resumes would be better off simply mentioning those skills within the body of the resume. That lets you talk about your skills in context.  To add to the problem, many skills sections come off as very weak, using low-level soft skills that act as filler.  I see many skills sections with things like \""problem solving\"", \""critical thinking\"", \""beginner german\"", etc.  None of those skills, when said without any context, are likely to get you hired.  Instead, they drag the resume down.  Skills sections are great if you feel your professional overview could benefit from a single grid of say, 12 keywords that you know are highly sought-after and searched for (IT guys, software developers, obviously this is very relevant to you).  But project managers, people who work in operations and only have a few software applications they need to know, and other such professions can easily mention a couple of keywords in their summary and the rest within the body of the resume itself.  Simply put, ask yourself if your skills section really adds meat to your resume, or if it just feels like extra fluff.\n* Lastly, let's talk about fluff in general.  I read bloated resumes every single day.  I'm wordy and often need to review my writing to cut it down to something shorter and easier to consume (this post is living proof).  When people try to write something impressive, they use far more words and phrases than they need.  They say things like 'Successfully handled in-bound calls for a law firm' when there was really no point in using the word \""Successfully\"".  They try to make their college job at burger king sound like a master class in multi-tasking and customer service, when really it's just a job that helped you pay the bills in college, and employers have no problem with accepting it for what it is.  Most resumes should be shorter. Most should be very plainly written, more direct, and stick to quickly relaying what kind of tasks you did, what kind of results you achieved, how you approached specific problems or projects, and what skills and abilities you picked up along the way.  When you write a resume this way, and when you write it so that you're only offering a prospective employer the info he needs to bring you in for an interview, you drastically increase the chances your resume will get read, and the chances of your message getting through to them.  Long resumes with extra sections, nonsense soft skills and excessive detail are killing your chances of success.\n\nI hope everyone's off to a productive week in their job search.  I'll be quite active on Reddit this week, weighing in on as many resumes as I can, and I'm happy to take questions here, via PM, or anywhere else we see fit.

If you are not confident enough in your skills, don't put them on there. If you are mediocre, don't sell yourself short by putting a progress bar, go to the interview and see if they even need an exceptional candidate\n\n6) don't put your photo, it leads to discrimination, especially in the US\n\n7) If your volunteer experience is relevant to your job, you can put it under \""experience\"" as long as you don't label it \""work experience\"" or \""employment\"" you aren't lying\n\n8) If did some free or cheap work for a family member or friend, you can say you did some freelance commissions. If they ask for taxes, you can be honest and say that you didn't file taxes on the income, since you did it as a side hustle and did not make enough to pay tax on it.\n\nNotice how none of this is actually lying. It's removing unnecessary details to make a good impression.\n\nPeople who say \""lie\"" are doing it for clickbait, like this post. Do not lie about stuff you've never done in your life.\n\nBackground checks will catch you immediately and if you somehow still get hired, someone will wonder why they don't know you. Especially if you lied that you were a senior, or that you did something really important in the company. \n\nLike, if I lied that I came up with the Dynamic Island for ios, someone would wonder why they don't know me because of how important that was and I'll get found out real fast.\n\nYou can always apply to jobs even if you don't meet the requirements. The job posting is describing the ideal candidate, not what they are actually looking for.

I just recently graduated about 3 months ago and this subreddit has helped me in many ways. I have been ghosting for awhile just looking through other people's resume and try to gain ideas and ways to improve my own resume. Only now that I am coming out of my shell to speak about it.  I am glad this subreddit exist as I would have not got my dream job if it wasn't for this. To give you a rough idea of how my first resume looked like :  [https://imgur.com/Vco8ySY](https://imgur.com/Vco8ySY)(Yes I know its horrible LOL)\n\nI figured I share some information about myself, so I graduated in Electrical Engineer in NY with a GPA of 2.1. To be honest I was not the brightest student, but try my very best to learn.  I have struggled to find a job upon graduation and had no luck for about 3 months. Been getting denials due to my GPA and that is where it hit me the most. I know in reality that GPA was not important once you gain experience but as a recent grad it was my mentality at that time. I was applying to lower end jobs such as a technician to just gain experience and work my way up. Plus the pandemic slowed down the hiring process.\n\nBut anyways it was a struggle but I try to keep my mentality positive and kept applying, change up the resume for different job postings, etc. Eventually got a call for interview and the process took about two weeks and now I am in Houston,TX working as a NASA Contractor (Jacobs). I have been looking into space industry for awhile and my wish was fulfilled.\n\nThe point of this is to not brag, that I work for NASA. I want to tell all you redditors (if that make sense lol) that this can happen to anyone. Cause in the end, there is always a reason why it happen. Who knows you might get a call you would not expect and you will be glad that it happen. I was offered a position in Raytheon,Blue Origin, and Northrop but was not selected in case you don't know. My advice is to just keep applying and change up your resume based on the job posting. Keep moving forward and be positive don't let negativity get to you, whether it is about not being selected, not getting calls, etc. I have been in your route before and am pretty sure everybody else has been. It will be a struggle at first but will be worth in the end because you never know where you will end up.\n\nResume that landed the job: [https://imgur.com/TOi7Sqk](https://imgur.com/TOi7Sqk)\n\nPlease excuse any grammar or spelling errors.\n\nI know this is not the best place to post but I figured I share it with everyone as it can apply to them.

He does this by leveraging his network of other rappers and record label personnel playing his songs for them any chance he gets. \n\nIn one scene, he decides to show up at a record labels office unannounced. He walks in, goes into random offices/cubicles, and is able to find a couple people willing to briefly listen to him. He plays them an early version of \u201cAll Falls Down\u201d, a single that eventually went double platinum and helped propel his first album to critical and commercial success.\n\nAs people in this community might guess, he cannot get anyone to react or take any action upon hearing this song. People are taking phone calls, typing emails, asking him to stop since they have other meetings, the only person who sort of engages with the song is the receptionist and even her opinion is ambiguous.\n\nSometimes when I\u2019m feeling down I start to wonder if the product I\u2019m selling is really in demand or if customers really need it. This scene got me thinking that even if you have an amazing product, perfect customer fit (this label did eventually sign him), charisma and self conviction, people are still going to regularly ignore and automatically file you to the bottom of their priority list when you\u2019re out selling.

I\u2019m sitting here on a Sunday morning with a clear head, life is in order and job is going really well.\n\nI\u2019m in b2b sales, professional services. Been in the space for coming up on 8 years. Across these roles I\u2019ve drank wine, beer, taken shots with customers, drank cocktails and ate a shit ton of company-paid-for food. I\u2019m now back in a head of sales role where I carry quota. It\u2019s field sales with a minimum of 5 lunches/dinners a week and mostly in alcohol-fueled environments. I do events 8 times a month too and it was common for me to get to Friday having had around ~15 beers that week already, before any kind of weekend socializing.\n\nI was overweight from the unhealthy nature of the job. I really didn\u2019t want to be hungover from work, not able to focus and being forced to drink by the etiquette of the job. I was also worried that I\u2019d feel pressure to drink, that it wasn\u2019t possible to do this job without having alcohol, people wouldn\u2019t trust me etc. So much head trash.\n\nI decided I wouldn\u2019t let this job and alcohol take over my life again. I decided to turn it into a positive impact on my life.\n\nI posted in this sub and got some good tips. I decided I would still buy drinks for clients, buy them food etc but I would just do zero alcohol beers: Heineken zero, Guinness zero or whatever they have in the bar. When it comes to food, to keep it healthy-ish I always go to a steak place and I just get a really good steak like a ribeye and have that with veg. When it\u2019s 1-1 with a prospect I sense they can be a little uncomfortable I\u2019m just drinking zero alcohol beers but in a group it\u2019s fine, I let the pre-sales guys get wasted and everyone is happy.\n\nThe end result is that I\u2019m closing more business, I\u2019ve lost 11kg (23lbs) from alcohol calories and drunk food, I feel better, I look better, I\u2019m having better quality and deeper relationships with my prospects, the pre-sales guys love it and the customer trusts me more because I\u2019m seen as the responsible adult at the table. I was really concerned about it initially, but the zero alcohol beers have changed my life for the better.

I listened for things like rapport, types of questions, DM landscape, pricing strategy, closing ability, up front contracts, trial closes, open vs closed ended questions and on and on.\n\n**EDIT TO ADD: This is a sales floor of 26 sales people selling B2B SaaS. Average deal size is $32k in first year revenue and requires a contract.  Average contract length 19 months (meaning we sell 1 and 2 year and that is the average).**  \n\nBelow are my key findings and boy were they eye opening.\n\nThe main point take away would be this - the quality of the lead is way more important than anything else.  The top sales people don't do anything special; it's more what they don't do that is the difference.  They keep it simple and just ask \""would you like paper or plastic\""\n\n* Rapport - The top sales people have almost zero rapport.  Nothing about personal, nothing about business, just nothing.  They jump right into everything without the pleasantries.\n* Discovery - The top sales people are asking less than 5 questions in discovery and it certainly isn't SPIN or Challenger or Gap.  - No \""knock on effect\"" questions or anything.   It's just a couple of basic \""are you qualified\"" questions.  And I don't even mean around BANT or MEDDIC - literally just \""what's your credit score\"" level qualifying question.\n* Demonstration - The top sales people are doing, what can only be described as, feature dumping.  It's is just a quick rant on all the top features.  There is no tailored benefit statement, need payoff or anything.  It's literally just \""here is feature x and it does this.  Here is feature y and it does this\""\n* Decision makers - Either they are there or they aren't and there is nothing the top sales people are doing to ask for them.  Sometimes they are booked in with the DM from marketing, sometimes the influencer brings them on a later call.  Sometimes they don't show up at all.  The top sales people aren't ever talking about them and just going in a straight line, repeating the same process each time.  There is a small difference in win rates when they are there vs when they aren't but not enough that we need to focus on it.\n* Closing - The closest I've heard to asking for the business in the 100 calls was \""what are your thoughts\"".  There is no actual request for the business.\n* Objection handling - the deals that close, just don't seem to have them.  the customer is already basically sold so the questions are more around \""how does this work\"" and not objections.  If there was an objection it would be met with something like \""yeah, I hear what you are saying and this may not be the best solution for that\"".  There is brilliance in this answer to some degree.\n* Follow up - No evidence of it.  The quote is sent to the customer and sometimes they email back and sometimes they don't.\n\nSo?  What did I see that made these sales?\n\n* Great leads from the get go.  These customers were perfect fits and were in market.  Either having been past customers, referrals or working with an inferior competitor that we could beat on product and price. Some were from marketing but most were prospected by the sales team.  The people relying on marketing were the bottom performers.\n* Top sales people just took them through the process and showed them everything.  Bottom sales people RAN a process.  By that, I mean they asked very salesy questions like \""why is that important to you\"" or \""what happens if you don't do x\"" or \""is there anyone on your side that would feel left out if they didn't have input on this?\"".  If a need payoff question was asked that deal was almost always moved to closed lost.  People hate these and it puts them in a defensive position.\n* Tone.  Everything came down to tone.  It wasn't what people were doing, it was the people doing it.  It wasn't the questions that annoyed people, it was the way the sales person asked it.  Top sales people come off as nice, polite and enthusiastic.  Average or below sales people just didn't. The late night DJ voice may be great for hostages, but will a death sentence in SaaS.\n* Price - top sales people always opened with a very very low price.  They didn't try to max out each deal, they just gave the best price they could.\n* Top sales people treated every person like they were the decision maker.  They empowered them during the process and, if that person reached the end of their line, they would offer to care the deal to the next person, they never had to be asked to.\n\nSales is a WAY less complicated than we make it.\n\n* Get the best leads in your pipeline.  If you aren't given them, go prospect to them.\n* Don't make it hard for people to buy.  Just show them what you have.\n* Discovery is wildly overrated.  Not that it isn't important it's just that, unless you've mastered it, you're better off keeping it simple rather than trying to master it on the call with a customer in real time.  Save that shit for off the phones.\n* How you sound is the biggest differentiator for sales success.  Some people have awesome voices some don't.  If you are outside sales then it's probably how you look more than sound.\n\nAnyway, that's my observation and I hope it helps people simplify the process down.\n\nTLDR; Gong might be full of shit.""",My top level take aways after having listened to 100 sales call,0.9500000000000001,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/13uvsrs/my_top_level_take_aways_after_having_listened_to/,2023-05-29 14:01:44,May,2023

He said, \""A lot of new sales people will find ways to stay in the office. They'll study the products, rehearse their presentation, meet with peers, engage marketing, try to learn everything they can. But all you need to do is pick up the phone, set up meetings with executives, and then get them to open up to you.\""\n\nSo that's what I did. And I couldn't believe how wonderful it was. And I remember becoming a top salesperson rather quickly while a few of my new peers did what my mentor warned me against, and got off to much slower starts than I. For the better part of the next 10 years, this trend continued, and I made a lot of money in commissions and was routinely the top rep regardless of where I worked.\n\nIt was about 2009 when I started to see a shift happening. My employer at the time started scheduling more internal calls to plan/talk, and started not just requesting but in fact dictating that we enter everything we did into CRM, and mandated our engaging marketing to roll out automated marketing campaigns. At first I blew it off as just noise, but then I started getting increased pressure from within. I remember the irony of that day in early 2010, when the very same day I received a signature on a new logo 3.9M contract that I found by cold calling and that put me over quota for the 4th straight year for that employer, that our COO sent me a public email saying \""Boo!\"" because I was ranked dead last for number of automated emails sent out. I remember taking exception to that, pointing out that what did it matter if I was last in email marketing if I was by far and away the #1 rep overall? But within a few quarters they started attaching our comp plans to our engagement of their marketing automation tool. So I left.\n\nBut over the last 13 years, it has gotten worse, no matter where I go.\n\nI put together a powerpoint presentation a few weeks ago that was well received by a potential new client. They sponsored another presentation in front of their CFO, and seemed excited about my presentation. But minutes after the meeting ended, my Chief Revenue Officer called me -- \""Some of your slides didn't follow our branding,\"" he said, not. unlike the TPX Cover Page in Office Space. So next time around I lost a couple of hours reformatting our slides to match our corporate-mandated template.\n\nToday in our sales meeting, my CRO announced our quarterly numbers were down for the second time in a row. But he made a point to send kudos to three of my peers who have pipelines spread out across all our product groups and have the most engagement in Outreach, our marketing automation platform. Are they at quota? No. Have any of their marketing emails resulted in new clients? No. But the fact they've sent a bazillion emails to prospects who by and large haven't responded is being praised as the standard we go after. Since a year ago, I've closed two new logos by way of cold calling and over 130% of my quota, but I feel like on a daily basis that I\""m about to be fired since all I hear is constructive criticism from management about my marketing and limited pipeline, etc..\n\nI change jobs a lot. Mostly because I'm a free agent (no equity) and I don't need to make a million dollars a year anymore, so I don't have to put up with the BS like when my family was young. So I'm pretty versed in a lot of company cultures.

MVPhillips,1512122987,,,164,7gu4ar,640,sales,"""Hi all! Hope you're crushing it going into December; I know it's a tough time of year. I created a post on how I cold call, and I'd love to hear your tips and tricks too. I understand some may disagree with my methodology, and that's okay. Let's keep it civilised.\n\n#This Cold Calling Script Booked Me Meetings With The Biggest Law Firms in Adelaide#\n\nCold calling is a unique weapon in the salesperson\u2019s arsenal. I send emails, texts, Linked In messages, and heck, even hand-written letters, but nothing compares to picking up the phone and making the call. It\u2019s like bringing a bazooka to a knife fight. Here\u2019s my take on a perfect B2B cold calling script which you might find helpful too.\n\nAlternative types of communication are all one-way. Through mediums such as emails, texts, social messages and letters, it doesn\u2019t require the other person to \u201cbuy-in\u201d to the communication. Consider that for a moment.\n\nThose contact efforts are easy for the prospect to put-off, save for later, ignore and forget. They definitely serve a purpose, and I believe a great salesperson uses all forms of communication available, but nothing will replace a phone call.\n\nPhone calls are a personal, two-way, real-time interaction. I\u2019ve achieved more in a single call than weeks of touches via other channels. Honestly, while prospects seem \u201cannoyed\u201d at cold callers, they also can appreciate the effort of a human wanting to get in contact with them, especially after multiple attempts.\n\nBut there is a right way and a wrong way to execute a cold call, and it can be confronting for both the salesman and the prospect. Immediately, people raise their defences when they receive an unsolicited call, so we need to disarm them and instil trust.\n\nI\u2019ll explain the theories behind each section of my call so you can tailor it to your industry and company.\n\nI\u2019ve conducted a lot of research on how to perfect cold calling, because it\u2019s arguably the most important call in your relationship with a prospect. It\u2019s the \u201cfirst date\u201d of the business world, so you\u2019d best impress!\n\n**The Cold Calling Open/Introduction**\n\n*Hi John, this is Michael from XYZ, have I caught you at a bad time?*\n\nLet\u2019s break this down.\n\n+ Introduce yourself in a happy tone. Keep it short, succinct and polite. Speak confidently \u2013 like you would talk to a friend.\n\n+ Address the prospect by their first name, to infer you\u2019re of equal status. While saying \u201cMr.\u201d or \u201cMrs.\u201d can be a sign of respect, it also communicates that the prospect is more important than you. You\u2019re calling with a solution to help them and your time is also of great importance; don\u2019t put the prospect on a pedestal.\n\n+ I stopped saying \u201cMy name is Michael\u2026\u201d and started announcing \u201cThis is Michael\u2026\u201d I found this yields more positive responses, perhaps because it conveys a sense of authority. It also cuts the total number of words down.\n\n+ I also experienced better results using my first name and the company, but not my last name. I want to remove any unnecessary words, and simplify my message as much as possible for the prospect. Not to mention, when talking to a friend, you\u2019re on a first name basis.\n\n+ I hate it when sales people ask me: \u201cHow are you?\u201d I know they don\u2019t care, and it\u2019s honestly a waste of time asking. They\u2019re interrupting my day, they\u2019re a stranger to me AND they\u2019re asking me a shallow question? Save that for people you\u2019re acquainted with. Instead, I\u2019d prefer to be asked \u201cHave I caught you at a bad time?\u201d for four reasons, so I tend to do the same:\n\n1) It\u2019s courteous and shows I respect the prospect\u2019s time.\n\n2) A question encourages the prospect to \u201cbuy-in\u201d to the conversation; it takes two to tango.\n\n3) When someone receives an unsolicited phone call, their immediate reaction in their mind is negative and hence no, no, no. By asking if I\u2019ve caught them at a bad time, the answer \u201cno\u201d is actually the positive answer. This isn\u2019t a Jedi mind trick, but it often buys you a bit more time to get your point across.\n\n4) Even if I have caught them at a really bad time, the prospect often says \u201cYes, but can you call back in an hour?\u201d\n\n**The Reason**\n\n*The reason I\u2019m calling is because we\u2019re helping the big law firms in Adelaide with their property valuation needs, and I thought you might be interested too.* **Then stop talking and wait.**\n\n+ The aim of stating the intention of my call cuts to the chase and \u201csets a hook\u201d in the prospect. I want to create enough interest so they want to learn more. But you don\u2019t have to hit the prospect with facts and figures; you just have to arouse curiosity. Remember, people buy from people. Be real and authentic.\n\n+ The way you deliver this is crucial. You must be articulate, but excited; clear but upbeat.\n\n+ I realise this pitch on paper doesn\u2019t sound exactly exciting, but the reason it works for me is because (most) lawyers are open to learning about how we can benefit them and their clients.\n\n+ I tried different variations such as: \u201cThe reason I\u2019m calling is because we help save lawyers time and money with property valuations\u2026\u201d but the response I got was that it was \u201ctoo salesy,\u201d and they became more hostile over the phone.\n\n+ \u201c\u2026we\u2019re helping the big law firms in Adelaide\u2026\u201d is social proof that we\u2019re helping companies LIKE them, and we\u2019re local. This cements a trust in the prospect that we can actually provide some value to them.\n\n+ \u201c\u2026and I thought you might be interested too.\u201d Who could be angry at that? I disarm the prospect but letting them know I\u2019m not selling anything at this stage; all I\u2019ve done is explain we\u2019ve helped others like them and now I\u2019m thinking we MIGHT be able to help them too. This provides a great avenue for more questions regardless if their response is \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d\n\n+ Then stop talking and wait for a response. In many instances, the prospect has already started talking, but if not, use the silence to create an atmosphere where the prospect HAS to say something. Often the prospect is interested and wants to hear how we can help, but on the odd occasion some they say they\u2019re not interested.\n\n**Qualify**\n\nThe aim here is to \u201cinvestigate\u201d by asking questions. While my hypothesis is that we can help them, I want to make sure they\u2019re a good fit for us. There\u2019s nothing worse than a bad customer, or wasting time with someone that the product/service isn\u2019t going to suit.\n\nUsing a date as a scenario, imagine if you just talked the whole time about how good you are. Personally, that would be an awkward situation. The typical salesperson (myself included) is a type-A, extroverted personality who enjoys conversing, talking and having a laugh. Our job is to ask questions, and then shut up, listen, and absorb what they tell us.\n\n**If they say they\u2019re interested**\n\n*Great. If I could ask you real-quick, how many family law clients do you have at the moment?*\n\n*On average, what percentage of those would need their property valued?*\n\n*Who do you typically use for property valuations?*\n\n*What\u2019s your experience been like with those firms?*\n\n*Sounds like we might be a good fit for you. Lawyers find us useful because we service a bigger area across the state, and we also value all types of property. So we\u2019re able to save you time because we\u2019re more of a one-stop-shop.*\n\n**If they say they\u2019re not interested**\n\n*Oh, that\u2019s okay, I understand. If I could ask you real-quick, is it a timing issue or something else?*\n\nIf it\u2019s a timing issue, organise a time then and there of when they\u2019ll be able to give their full attention, and lock them into a meeting via email calendar. If it\u2019s something else, you should have your objection/complaint responses ready. Then, depending on how that goes, you can re-direct to the questions from the \u201cinterested\u201d category.\n\n**Closing on a Meeting**\n\n*I\u2019d love to meet with you and learn more about what you do, are you free sometime next week? Preferably Monday morning or Tuesday afternoon if that suits you?*\n\n+ Emotional words like \u201clove\u201d create impact and show how interested you are, just to learn more about them. The sales process is all about the prospect and getting them to the \u201cpromise land\u201d with your solution.\n\n+ Narrow down their options to make it psychologically easier for them, but also leave it open to working around them if need be. That\u2019s polite.\n\n**A better way to make sales scripts**\n\nWhile scripts can boost your sales, conversations aren\u2019t linear. It can be difficult to work off of scripts on paper, because when you ask the prospect questions, the responses can vary. This is why I created SalesWolf.io, so no matter what direction the conversation takes, I can maintain control and work toward the goal.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo be a cold calling master, you need to be enthusiastic and deliberate in the words you speak, while engaging the prospect in a two-way communication. Being short, sharp and shiny is effective; don\u2019t beat around the bush. Keep the goal of the call in mind and never forget: people do business with people!\n\n**TL;DR - simplicity, deliberate, short, sharp, shiny, script, questions, listen, close meeting and be an empathetic person**""","How I perfected my cold calling, and it might help you too",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/7gu4ar/how_i_perfected_my_cold_calling_and_it_might_help/,2017-12-01 10:09:47,December,2017

This guide is going to go through the absolute basics and then get into more and more niche topics; if you want to read fast, skip the stuff you know, otherwise grab a notepad and get your plan in order.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Understanding the concept of sales**\n****\n\nBefore we even think about getting into tips on how to get a job, let&#39;s get a pure basic understanding in place, go read the following books:\n\n  - [How to win friends and influence people](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0091906814/ref=sr_1_1?crid=11ZYLHHOAVSTP&keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people&qid=1582153753&sprefix=how+to+win+friend%2Caps%2C266&sr=8-1)\n  - [Rich dad, poor dad](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680194/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Rich+dad%2C+poor+dad.&qid=1582153771&sr=8-1)\n  - [4-hour workweek](https://www.amazon.co.uk/4-Hour-Work-Week-Escape-Anywhere/dp/0091929113/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=4-hour+workweek&qid=1582153785&sr=8-5)\n\n\nThese books probably won&#39;t teach you much that you don&#39;t already know, but they will tell you what you already know in a new way. You need to understand that sales is about connecting with people; that is the number 1 most important thing. Everything else is strategy and techniques. But even if you know every technique, if you&#39;re a dick to be around, well\u2026 you probably won&#39;t make it far in sales.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Choosing the industry**\n****\nSo you want to be in sales? selling what exactly?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you can&#39;t install an app on your phone, maybe tech sales isn&#39;t for you. But that doesn&#39;t mean your dreams of being the #1 salesman are dead\u2026 this could be the beginning of something better for you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nListed below are the most common industries, and what I know about them:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n| **Industry** | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Tech** | You sell consulting or software to companies. These could be small hair salons and vape stores or giant operations that use your software as the backbone of their business. You probably need to work in a city/tech hub. |\n| **Med** | You sell hardware/pharmaceuticals to hospitals/surgeries/local practices. You might manage a list of accounts or you might be hustling hospital to hospital like Will Smith in *The Pursuit of Happiness*. |\n| **Finance/Insurance** | You sell financial packages to different operations and individuals. Might mean cold-calling an account list, or could be consultative. |\n| **Hardware/Construction** | Schools, houses, roads and cities need materials to be built. You work with different groups selling equipment, services or supplies. |\n| **Cars** | You sell rocket ships\u2026.. It&#39;s car sales\u2026 you sell, cars. |\n| **Door to Door** | Knock, knock? - Who&#39;s there? - Give me your money for this solar panel. |\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo if you&#39;re looking for advice on 5 out of the 6 of the above, then you just ran out of luck, buddy. I don&#39;t know anything about those industries, so figure it out yourself.\n\nTech buddies, however, let&#39;s make some money!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Terminology. What the hell do these words mean?**\n****\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSDR, AE, MM, SMB, PROSPECTING, ACV, OPS - What the hell gibberish are you talking about?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe have all been there, a million different abbreviations and references to things nobody has probably ever spoken about before. So let&#39;s break down all the common terms you will come across in the near future. Make sure to drop these buzzwords in your future interviews to really sound like you know what you&#39;re talking about.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPay will vary based on location - These are averages based on first hand experience. There will also be outliers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJobs in the USA may vary from the below figures. Typically 30% higher pay, but will vary depending on location.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n| **JOB TITLE** | **PAY RANGE (Salary)** | **PAY RANGE (OTE)** | **DESCRIPTION** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SDR:   Sales Development Representative (sometimes called Business Development Manager) | \u00a325,000 - \u00a340,000 | \u00a350,000 - \u00a380,000 | Dialling and smiling. Your job will be to get in touch with people at different companies, with the goal of piquing their interest enough that you schedule a meeting with them. Done via email, Linkedin, calls or conferences. This meeting is either ran by yourself or an AE and is used to learn more about a company before showing them a demo. You will typically get paid if they show up to a demo. |\n| SMB AE: Small Medium Business Account Executive | \u00a330,000 - \u00a360,000 | \u00a350,000 - \u00a3140,000 | Dance, monkey, dance. Your job will be to put on a show and present (demo) to an individual/team at a company with the goal of convincing them to buy your software. This involves showing them a demo, organising follow-up meetings and going through the process to get a decision-maker (DM) to sign a contract with your company. You will typically get paid when they sign. |\n| MM AE: Mid-Market Account Executive | \u00a340,000 - \u00a375,000 | \u00a360,000 - \u00a3150,000 | Fancy suit monkey. Your job will be the same as an SMB AE but will involve more steps, with bigger companies. Have you ever gone through the terms and conditions of an agreement before? if not, get used to it. |\n| ENT AE: Enterprise Account Executive | \u00a350,000 - \u00a3100,00 | \u00a370,000 - \u00a3250,000 | Fancy suit monkey with top hat and monocle. I see you have been putting on some good demos and somehow lucked out on some big deals. Well now it&#39;s the big leagues. You live by the sword or die by the sword. The length of the interaction and complexity to get a DM to sign a contract has now rapidly increased. Get on a plane, fancy suit monkey, and go dance. |\n| SALES MANAGER | \u00a360,000 - \u00a3120,000 | \u00a380,000 - \u00a3200,000 | Smart monkey or dumb monkey? Your job will be to guide your team to victory. To make sure they are motivated, understand their mistakes and are using the best tips and advice to get deals in. You&#39;re likely going to a meeting, but are supporting your team and helping manage internal politics and resources. You get paid based on your team's accumulative sales. |\n| MD: Managing Director | \u00a3100,000+ | \u00a3100,000+ | Very smart monkey or super dumb monkey? Your job is to manage a team of managers and individuals, and to make sure your managers are leading and not bullying their teams. You are helping on big deals and making sure that important clients get what they need so that you can make those dollar dollar bills yo. |\n| HEAD OF SALES | \u00a3100,000+ | \u00a3100,000+ | Very smart monkey or lying monkey? Your job is to manage the managers and work with other heads of the organisation. You are the captain of the ship, the life of the crew is in your hands. |\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n| Terminology | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cold call | When you call someone who is not expecting your call. Typically done in an attempt to book a meeting. |\n| Lead | This is the classification within your database for individuals/companies that you are trying to get in contact with/manage a relationship with.  Typically this will be used when &#39;marketing assign a 'lead'&#39;, meaning a individual who has engaged in marketing activities (i.e. clicked a email), in which they now believe there is a higher chance of that person being interested in buying your goods/services. |\n| Account | This is the terminology used to refer to a company/group that you are trying to get in contact with/manage a relationship with. |\n| Contact | This is the terminology used to refer to an individual who is  listed under an &#39;account&#39;. I.e. Susan is my contact at ABC company; she is Head of E-commerce. |\n| Example of a lead, a contact and an account. | Susan at ABC company visits the website of the company you work for. She enters her email address in order to download a webinar. This information is passed onto your marketing team, who gives the information to an SDR and asks the SDR to email/call Susan to try book a meeting. Susan responds saying that she isn&#39;t interested, however, her colleague Tom from Marketing would be a better person to speak with. Susan is now changed from a lead, into a contact.  An account is created for ABC company and an additional contact is created with Tom&#39;s details. This allows you to enter notes for the company and write down what has happened, so that you and your organisation can manage lots of relationships with different organisations at once. |\n| Disco: discovery call | A discovery call is a meeting with a client, typically booked by an SDR. The goal of this initial meeting is to give the client a basic understanding of what your company can do for them, but also to gain information about the client (i.e. what issues they are experiencing/what they are looking to do to further develop their business), so that you can tailor what you show the client if they decide they want to see a demo next. |\n| Demo call | A demo is a meeting, typically done either via a screen sharing tool (Google Hangouts, Zoom, Skype) or in-person, where a client is shown a presentation deck or a live demonstration of the software/service they would be getting from your company in exchange for money. |\n| CRM | Customer Relationship Management. Examples are Salesforce, Hubspot or even a spreadsheet with names and phone numbers. |\n| OP: Opportunity | An 'op' is created when a demo is marked as qualified, meaning the AE would like to continue speaking with this company and will, therefore, allow the SDR/other departments to get credit for the work they have done. |\n| Agreement/contract | An agreement between two companies that lays out the products/services offered in exchange for money, along with terms and conditions. |\n| Legal | Legal department |\n| SMB | Small- and medium-sized businesses. Companies generating under a set revenue. Could be 5 million, could be 30 million; this depends on what your company sets out. |\n| Mid Market | Mid-market companies are bigger than startups, but smaller than corporations. Could be a bunch of very smart people growing rapidly, or an old, dumb company slowly dying. Just because they are big, doesn&#39;t mean they have money. Typically over 35 million GBP revenue. Varies, however. Usually much slower at making a decision, but bigger deals. |\n| Enterprise | Larger, more formal companies, usually a lot more hoops to jump through and people involved. |\n| Call to action | Something you or the person you are speaking to will need to do. Such as meeting for a coffee or scheduling a follow-up meeting. |\n| OTE | On Target Earnings, this is how much you will make before taxes when your Salary and Commission is combined. If you don't hit your target, you won't make this much, if you exceed your target, it will be higher. Typically it be 2x Salary. i.e. 40,000 Salary and 40,000 Comission if you hit your target. |\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow that you know your terminologies, you&#39;re practically already a millionaire. Throw these around during the interview process and very shortly you will be in your first role.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Books**\n****\n\nSo you want some books to read \u2026 Are you actually going to read them? Get the audible version and listen to each of them, then also get a physical copy and read it. If you have to read just one, read the SDR book by WBD. It&#39;s a boring read, but it will help you.\n\n1.

Be persistent; this is sales after all. I might not respond immediately; keep bothering me. If you&#39;re good, I will do my best to help, if you suck, that&#39;s on you, buddy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nYour first job in sales will typically start as an SDR. You don&#39;t need a degree to get the role, but for certain companies, you won&#39;t get an interview because of it. The first step you need to do is create a CV:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The CV**\n****\n[CV Example](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSmwZUCVIWeWZSGlsZINlcFV61_1G9d890GMB8xXaLxh53NvNTH2qCXhMYrrKGBytbiws_lPxNN_hHt/pub)\n\n\n\n\nThis is my CV from when I first applied for a role in sales. I got interviews. This is not your CV, so don&#39;t copy it, but use it as inspiration.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTip - Write the CV for the job. Exaggerate the hell out of it, so long as you can back up what you say. You&#39;re about to be a salesperson; if you can&#39;t exaggerate the truth a little bit for your own interests, then you are probably in the wrong profession.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYour manager will know that you&#39;re exaggerating, but that doesn&#39;t matter. How confidently you say it does. So long as you don&#39;t suck as an SDR, whatever you say is fair game. Don&#39;t lie, but tell the story of the best version of yourself.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Recruiters**\n****\n\nOne of the very first things you should be doing is trying to find recruiters looking for SDRs. They can easily be found on Linkedin. Send them a connection and then ask if they are open to new candidates and send them your CV and the role you&#39;re looking for. You will also come across them as you apply to jobs directly, talk and meet with as many of them as possible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, before you get any further: there&#39;s something you need to know about recruiters. They are two-faced ass kissers who will screw you over without a second thought. Joking. Kinda...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRecruiters are salespeople too. They have targets to hit of their own by filling roles with candidates. If you are not a good candidate they are not going to want to work with you.\n\nSo how can  you be a good candidate? Easy:\n\n- ALWAYS show up IN TIME (=15 minutes before, minimum)\n- Get a new haircut, beard trim/shave\n- Buy a fitting suit (under \u00a3200 will do)\n- Get a pair of nice shoes (under \u00a3100 is fine)\n- Bring a notepad and several pens (put 5 of them in the pen holder in your backpack) to your interview\n- Bring several copies of your CV (inside a leather pouch holder) to your interview\n- Bring a copy of the job description to your interview\n- Always answer your phone\n- Prepare for interviews (seriously, 2 hours prep)\n- Practice what you are going to say\n- Tell your recruiter how your interview went immediately after and keep them in every email communication (cc or bcc)\n- Do what recruiters tell you to do (with exceptions to below)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow\u2026 you don&#39;t have to be a doormat. The above are the minimum requirements to become across prepared and give you a leg up on like 90% of other candidates. Seriously, the BASICS are more important than pretty much anything else. Nobody is expecting you to be a good salesperson, but they are expecting you to understand that you need to be open to learning.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe key to dealing with recruiters is to set your boundaries from day 1 , but to also to be reasonable. If this is your first role, don&#39;t expect to get the perfect job in your ideal niche/industry. Be open to suggestions made by your recruiter. At the same time, if you give them a hand and they will take an arm. If they think you will accept any role, they will send you to any role, including the crap ones.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShow up on time and communicate often and clearly with your recruiter. You don&#39;t need to share your minute by minute updates. Just show up to meetings/interviews on time and well prepared, and as soon as the meeting is over call/email the recruiter letting them know how the interview went.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRecruiters make money from getting you a job. They are partially on your team, but you are not paying them, so don&#39;t expect too much.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Direct outreach**\n****\n\nDidn&#39;t you say you wanted to be a silver-tongued salesperson? Would a smooth-talking, slick back salesperson wait for sales to come to him? Or does he go out and find what he wants and takes it?\n\nYou said you wanted to be in sales, so start selling yourself. Look up companies that you find interesting and call up the sales managers/offices of these companies and tell them why they need to hire you. Book your own interview.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Preparing for the interview**\n****\n\nLots of people say you need to prepare for the interview, but they don&#39;t tell you what to prepare.\n\nThis is my [cheat-sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vST9IALruYa7Q0-K2FZVFO8fqo0wvp6pOcXKusu-mnRyybv4-EJxfrAJHH_tBiGcwUtBLBP6fczkMMk/pub) for every interview I did. Nobody does this stuff, it's a bit crazy and takes up a lot of time, however, you always want to set yourself apart and this is how to do it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou should be filling this out every time you are going to an interview. You should make one for every person you are going to meet and take them with you to the interview room. Seriously, open up your leather document holder, one side containing the many copies of your CV (give one to everyone you meet - if they don't have their own copy already), the other side holding a cheat-sheet on every single person you're meeting. Let them spot it; they will be impressed! 70% of sales is the presentation. Nothing catches a salesperson's attention like seeing a piece of paper with their own face on it. Prep for your interviews, but most importantly, let them know you prepared.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Interview**\n****\nGet a smart outfit/suit together, stand tall, shake hands firmly and have a positive attitude.\n\nThe goal is to get THEM to talk. Ask them why they are looking for an SDR, what they think would make the perfect one, then write it down and read it back to them. Next show them why you are the solution to their problem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Post Interview**\n****\nAdd they persons who interviewed you on LinkedIn and write them a 'summary email'. Working in sales, we do this for every client we meet. Show that you are doing this yourself already.\n\n\n\n[Example of a Post interview email and Linkedin message.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vReoHT4y2kxRmAR7cFCS8pfyCAhs6YGyFLU0gDvpNT0rRZLID7khTbNfj_y4wpwtZOMZkFR2Td4g5tn/pub)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are a ton of spelling and grammar mistakes, so better not copy and paste, but rewrite this in your own words! Seriously\u2026 Do you want the job? Rewrite the damn thing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMake sure you include a 'call to action'(CTA), a coffee, a phone call, anything, but don&#39;t wait to be called back, be proactive.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Follow-Ups:**\n****\n* Do you think salespeople make 1 demo and then sell the product?\n* Do you think SDR&#39;s make one phone call and then book a demo?\n* Follow-up is 90% of the job.\n* Make the effort to follow-up with the interviewer.\n* If they don&#39;t answer you 2 days prior to the CTA dates you have suggested. Confirm it with them.\n* No answer 1 day prior?  - Phone call them!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat are they going to do?, say hey, stop calling me I&#39;m not ready?\n\n&quot;Exactly, and if you were a decision-maker at a company I was outreaching I would continue to get in touch. I&#39;m sorry for the persistence, but I think it&#39;s very important to practice what you preach and I&#39;m afraid if that means calling you once a week to keep onto of this sales cycle, then, unfortunately, I&#39;m going to continue. I hope you understand and would want your team to do the same.&quot;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAny sales manager that doesn&#39;t understand that and is angry that you are chasing him, is a sales manager you don&#39;t want to work for.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**You got the job!**\n****\n\nWasn&#39;t even difficult was it Mr Beast?\n\nYou killed the recruitment process, nailed the interview, ain&#39;t nobody stopping you.\n\nMonday you start and now it&#39;s time to make a killing\u2026. Oh yeah.. Wait.. How do we do that exactly?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**How to be an SDR**\n*****\n\nPART 2\u2026 If you&#39;re interested in learning more, let me know. Maybe I&#39;ll write something. Maybe not?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo if you&#39;re looking for advice on 5 out of the 6 of the above, then you just ran out of luck buddy. I don&#39;t know anything about those industries, so figure it out yourself.\n\nTech buddies, however, let&#39;s make some money!\n\n&nbsp;""","SDR GUIDE - How to become a slick, silver-tongued, money-making SDR.",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/f8q9r9/sdr_guide_how_to_become_a_slick_silvertongued/,2020-02-24 12:05:16,February,2020

I\u2019m planning on accepting an offer from an outside company here in a couple weeks for more money than I could have ever imagined making just a few short years ago. Sales is an incredible career and I\u2019m so glad I found it. I want everyone in the profession to know how to be really good at it. \n\nHere are my top 10 practical tips for enterprise solution sellers that have greatly helped me in my career. If you keep these 10 in mind, I think they will greatly help most sellers. I\u2019m always willing to chat more or answer any questions you may have. Just dm me. \n\n1. Many in management are in management because they can not sell.\n\n2. Your buyers make a purchasing decision. You never ever make a sale.\n\n3. Just because you can bulldoze buyers doesn\u2019t mean you should. Overcoming objections and \u201cnot taking no for an answer\u201d will occasionally work. If you choose to work this way though, you\u2019ll never be anything more than a run rate seller.\n\n4. Three way validation: Validate what your management is telling you to do, with what you see your companies top performers doing, and with what you read from top sales thought leaders.\n\n5. Detach and function as a consultant when talking to a customer. Your goal is to discover if your product solution honestly makes sense for your buyer. Cheerleader salespeople freak buyers out. If you can successfully detach from your bias, you\u2019ll function as a partner/trusted advisor and not someone to be suspicious of/argued with.\n\n6. The buyer(s) you are working with have a family and career as well. Don\u2019t ever take advantage/mislead a buyer.\n\n7. Don\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel- replicate what is working well until the market is exhausted. Who are your best customers? Who in the market looks the most like them? What product in your basket seems to work best? If you had to make a basket to win a sweepstakes, would you shoot a layup or a full court shot? \n\n8. Not everybody likes you. If you can- team sell. A deal is much more likely to close if you\u2019ve mobilized a group of people on both sides so that you have multiple POC\u2019s and potential advocates.\n\n9. Be honest with yourself and get those dead deals out of your pipeline. They are maybe making your pipeline reviews easier but they are seriously hampering your chances of being a top performer. \n\n10. You can only control what you can control. Your self worth is not tied into making quota.""",Accepting an offer Wednesday for 400K OTE- paying it forward by posting my top 10 tips for sellers who want to achieve outsized results.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/zqbaey/accepting_an_offer_wednesday_for_400k_ote_paying/,2022-12-20 02:14:24,December,2022

But after burnout from LSAT prep, and realizing I never really had a passion for the law, I told my parents I had second thoughts, which they refused to entertain. \n\nAt the beginning of this year a recruiter messaged me encouraging me to apply for a remote tech sales internship over the summer.

My mother exclaimed that she didn\u2019t spend nearly 100k for me to become a salesperson.

On the other hand, hey it's a free vacation to a place I wouldn't be able to vacation to on my own means.\n\nEDIT: Damn, you all some stone-cold motherfuckers. And I love you all for it.

coldcalls,1603493361,257e55e4-0047-11e3-b199-12313b0eb082,Advice,57,jgxoad,526,sales,"""Hi guys. \n\nI posted this elsewhere, but I doubt much people saw it.\n\nA little bit about me. I started working in the Financial Industry at 18 years old. Purely commission based, and all sales were done primarily over the phone.\n\nTo say it was rough in the beginning is an understatement. I had zero sales experience coming in, and was also a pretty shy kid growing up. As a matter of fact, the reason I got into sales was because my dad thought if I jumped head-first into a sales career it would help me break out of my shyness & anxiety.\n\n15 years later, I\u2019m still going strong and now at the peak of my career. I figured I could dispel a few myths and maybe offer some guidance.\n\nI know this has been talked about a bunch of times, but I figured I could contribute my own viewpoint on the subject.\n\n**COLD CALLING IS DEAD**\n\nNah. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve seen hundreds of blog posts every year for the last 15 years with this exact headline. Most of them were selling digital marketing services, go figure.\n\n**ONLY EXTROVERTS SUCCEED IN SALES**\n\nAgain, nope. As a matter of fact, some of the most successful people I\u2019ve come across in the industry were quite introverted. They made ME feel like a social butterfly. To give you an idea, growing up I was a very quiet kid who loved programming and always thought I would have ended up in that field. Never had many friends, so I barely left home. As a matter of fact, I used to spend summer vacations at home pretty much glued to my computer either playing World of Warcraft or learning how to program.\n\n**PEOPLE HATE GETTING CALLED**\n\nSure, some people get annoyed. Just like with ads on a Youtube video, popup ads on the internet, or commercial breaks on your TV. But if you had a good product that served who you were calling, you\u2019ll come to realize that those same people might actually be grateful for your call. It\u2019s just like any other form of advertisement. If people like what you are offering, great. Deliver on what you are selling and everyone wins. If not, no worries, move on from the call. And don\u2019t call people that are on the DNC. 80% of my client base started with an introductory phone call from me. The other 20% are referrals. I\u2019ve had clients stick around with me for over 10 years and have built very close relationships with many of them. All from a quick phone call that they weren\u2019t expecting.\n\n**COLD CALLING IS A NUMBERS GAME**\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this many times before. \u201cKeep dialing, it\u2019s a numbers game\u201d Or \u201cCold calling is a contact sport, just keep at it.\u201d It\u2019s always oversimplified. Let me break it down for you. Know your numbers. Know your closing rate, contact rate, cold lead to warm lead/prospect rate. You should be writing everything down daily. Over time if you see that you\u2019re consistently closing 10% of your warm leads, then you know that you need roughly 10 warm leads/qualified prospects to close a deal. That\u2019s when it becomes a \u201cnumbers game.\u201d Obviously, you should try and improve your closing rate, and any other measurable statistic that you have control over. Look at your cold-calling as a business. You should know every statistic possible about your calls. You should be able to predict future revenue based on your data - just like any other business would.\n\nA couple of tips for those struggling or thinking about getting into cold calling:\n\n* Know your customer profile & average turnaround time to sell your product. Not everyone is going to be a lead or a prospect. And you definitely do not want to be blindly pitching everyone your service. You should have a list of \u201cqualifying\u201d questions that you bring up in conversation to see if it\u2019s a good fit or not. If they are a good fit, and would be happy to work with you and your services, great. You\u2019ve got a new warm lead. You don\u2019t want to be wasting your time or the prospect's time presenting your service if there\u2019s no need.\n* Smiling works. You don\u2019t want to come off as robotic or monotone. I could go on about tonality and how important it is in your presentation - but the key is to sound sincere and helpful, really as simple as that. Smiling is disarming and contagious and even though they can\u2019t see you, the prospect on the other line can definitely hear the difference.\n* DISCIPLINE is one of the most important factors in cold calling success. I\u2019ve seen guys have amazing months and then stop cold calling. Eventually, they start wondering why they aren\u2019t having as much success as before, go into a negative spiral and eventually quit. Then they go to another company hoping things will magically change and end up doing the same thing. No matter your success levels, if cold calling is your primary way of getting business you just simply can't stop. Prospecting for new business is something that needs to be done as often as you can. If you lack time because you have a substantial book of business that you need to service, look into hiring callers for you. If it\u2019s a time management issue, then you need to fix that. To illustrate, imagine your local pizza shop had a great promotion and had the busiest month as far as new customers since their inception. The next month they put up a sign saying \u201cSorry, we aren\u2019t taking any new customers at this time.\u201d That obviously will never happen. But that\u2019s effectively what you are doing once you stop cold calling no matter where you are in your business.\n* Understand that some months will be great, some won\u2019t. Some days you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re on top of the world and other days you\u2019ll be down in the dumps. This is why discipline is important. You need to be able to train yourself to get the job done no matter what. That doesn\u2019t mean that you have to be closing deals everyday (unless it\u2019s a requirement of your job/business.) What it means is you need to show up and put the effort in making your dials, follow-ups, and whatever else your job entails.  \n\n\nHope it helps. Good luck guys.""",My thoughts on cold calling after 15 years...,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/jgxoad/my_thoughts_on_cold_calling_after_15_years/,2020-10-23 22:49:21,October,2020
Sailing_4th,1603661646,257e55e4-0047-11e3-b199-12313b0eb082,Advice,47,ji1oyl,515,sales,"""After almost 20 years of sales you learn quite a bit and I thought I\u2019d share some of that with y\u2019all during this pandemic.\n\nCurrently I work for a large technology company in the enterprise cloud space and am involved in some of the most unique and incredibly rewarding engagements. I was offered a role with $375k OTE with a major company but turned it down because I can do just as much, if not more where I\u2019m at. But also from a lifestyle standpoint I\u2019m happy today.\n\nBut to get there it took time and if I had to break down my experience I'd say this:\n\n1. There are no shortcuts. To get to a role where \""it's not work if you enjoy what you do\"" requires you to work the jobs you don't like to do to get there.\n\n2. Corporate America has no loyalty. You might have a good relationship with some people in the organization but when dollars and cents get involved you're just another FTE or number.\u00a0Complacency is your enemy.\n\n3. People do business with people they like. All the sales books you read are good when you're starting out but once you're working with millions of dollars on the negotiating table, its you they're buying from.\n\n4. Office politics is crucial to your success. It can help you get more leads, process your orders faster, get you promotions and make you a lot more money or give you more flexibility with your time. Be nice to everyone if even they can't do anything for you.\n\n5. Take notes. Lots and lots of notes. When the sales cycles get long on large contracts, people come and go on both sides of the table. It helps to have important details documented. Microsoft One Note is your friend.\n\n6. Disqualifying opportunities quickly. You learn not to waste time on a wild goose chase so be comfortable in saying no to a possible engagement early on and people will respect you for it.\n\n7. Never take your foot off the pedal. If you close a big deal, take a day to celebrate but then keep pressing.\u00a0Momentum is everything in sales. It also helps prevent your pay from going up and down each month.\n\n8. Use technology to your advantage. Automate things that you can, I mentioned One Note earlier, use your calendar to track your time, put notes in your CRM like Salesforce. Find out how to use filters and think of creative ways to find opportunities that are low hanging fruit.\n\n9. Become a good story teller. Remember that you\u2019re helping someone find a solution to a problem. Share stories of how you\u2019ve helped other customers and don\u2019t spend too much time being technical unless it\u2019s a technical conversation.\n\n10. It\u2019s ok to cross into the grey area. Sometimes you need to push your organization to make exceptions to win a deal. It\u2019s ok to ask for those, just be particular about which ones are worth fighting for.\n\n11. Take time off. Nothing bothers me more when someone tells me they\u2019re such a great employee because they only took 2 days off this year. Taking time off, traveling, spending time with loved ones gives you the fuel you need to stay motivated.\n\n12. Follow through on commitments. If you\u2019re running behind on getting something back to a client (internal or external), email or call them and let them know there\u2019s a delay but you haven\u2019t forgotten about them. This goes a long way in building credibility.\n\n13. Don\u2019t burn bridges. I actually wound up back in tech sales because a former employee of mine wound up becoming a recruiter and found that opportunity for me. We were never best friends and she was always a pain in my ass but we respected each other at work. You will run into people over and over again.\n\n14. Be humble. Even with my experience, I often come across people who are just brilliant sales people with so much to learn from. Take the time to thank them and ask if you can pick their brain.\n\nI\u2019m sure I can spend hours thinking of more but these are the most immediate ones that came to mind.""",New to sales or considering working in sales?

Ex: woman wanted two shoes to try on, he brings out another 3, then walks her to handbags, then jewelry. And exquisite customer care... We had old school black binders filled with our clients.

But I need to process and unload with people who understand. I was out with my college age daughter today and had to stop at dr office that happens to be in a horrible part of town. She wants Starbucks but then remembers the dive burger place nearby. I jokingly told her, \u201csure let\u2019s get a burger and maybe shot today. I\u2019m game!\u201d And that is where some divine intervention happened. We go in and there is a homeless man that was so pitiful looking and smelling. Took my breath away. I also got that energy that something bad may go down. Then I\u2019m telling myself to stop. But he was strung out on something. He keeps trying to get my attention. He finally makes eye contact and I said hi to him. Then\u2026 he says to me \u201cyou were my teacher, do you remember me?\u201d I did! Couldn\u2019t remember name because I\u2019m 54 and been at this for over 3 decades. I had him in first grade and my daughter was one year ahead at same school. So we talk and bless him he was struggling. He is homeless and just got out of drug and mental rehab. At this point I\u2019m just sick to my stomach. He walks outside and I ask the workers if he was causing any issues and if he had eaten. No, to both. So I go outside and ask him if I could buy his lunch. Next thing you know he is showing me his belongings and that is all he had. Sadly, some drugs were given to him by someone. He showed me he had no tracks on arms and I saw no needles. I went into teacher/mom mode and he told me what the pill number was. I told him he can\u2019t be using meds someone on Street gave him. He showed me other things he had dug from trash cans. I then talked to him about a contact I have with homeless services in town. But he said he would rather be on streets. That\u2019s when it hit me he was truly on something. I also found a kit that someone from an agency gave him to clean himself. I really just wanted to fix him right there but knew this is way bigger than the bandaid I had. So I took him inside the place and ordered him a meal and told him he had to be nice and respectful to everyone there. He thanked me over and over and then hugged me. I told him to be safe and take care of himself and find a safe place on the streets to sleep. I also told him to consider a shelter. When I walked away, kids sitting at another table asked who I was. As I was getting in my car I look up and he says, \u201cthat was my first grade teacher.\u201d He also had a huge smile on his face. I waved to him and told my daughter I was going to lose it when we pulled away. I ended up driving around the block a couple of times. My daughter said I did everything I could for him and not to feel guilty. But damn, he is only 19 and has been homeless awhile. It just sucks he was born into a shitty environment and was not able to climb out of it. But I always tell my kids on the last day of school they will always be one of my kids. So today, he is still my kid. And I got his belly full and he smiled. Hopefully when he lays down tonight he remembers I still care. Now I\u2019m crying and just wish I could have done more.

It's horrifying but it does not surprise me.\n\nI teach high school. Age range 15-18 years old. I have seen students who can't do the following:\n\n* Read at grade level. Some come into my classroom at a 3rd/4th grade reading level. There are some students who cannot sound out words.\n* Write a complete sentence. They don't capitalize the first letter of the sentence or the I's. They also don't add punctuation. I have seen a student write one whole page essay without a period.\n* Spell simple words.\n* Add or subtract double-digits. For example, they can't solve 27-13 in their head. They also cannot do it on paper. They need a calculator.\n* Know their multiplication tables.\n* Round\n* Graph\n* Understand the concept of negative.\n* Understand percentages.\n* Solve one-step variable equations. For example, if I tell them \""2x = 8. Solve for x,\"" they can't solve it. They would subtract by 2 on both sides instead of dividing by 2.\n* Take notes.\n* Follow an example. They have a hard time transferring the patterns that they see in an example to a new problem.\n* No research skills. The phrases they use to google are too vague when they search for information. For example, if I ask them to research the 5 types of chemical reactions, they only type in \""reactions\"" in Google. When I explain that Google cannot read minds and they have to be very specific with their wording, they just stare at me confused. But even if their search phrases are good, they do not click on the links. They just read the excerpt Google provided them. If the answer is not in the excerpts, they give up.\n* Just because they know how to use their phones does not mean they know how to use a computer. They are not familiar with common keyboard shortcuts. They also cannot type properly. Some students type using their index fingers.\n\nThese are just some things I can name at the top of my head. I'm sure there are a few that I missed here.\n\nNow, as a teacher, I try my best to fill in the gaps. **But I want the general public to understand that when the gap list is this big, it is nearly impossible to teach my curriculum efficiently.** This is part of the reason why teachers are quitting in droves. You ask teachers to do the impossible and then vilify them for not achieving it. You cannot expect us to teach our curriculum efficiently when students are grade levels behind. Without a good foundation, students cannot learn more complex concepts. I thought this was common sense, but I guess it is not (based on admin's expectations and school policies).\n\n***I want to add that there are high-performing students out there. However, from my experience, the gap between the \""gifted/honors\"" population and the \""general\"" population has widened significantly. Either you have students that perform exceptionally well or you have students coming into class grade levels behind. There are rarely students who are in between.***\n\nAre other teachers in the same boat?""",The public needs to know the ugly truth.

Let me tell you,my school life SUCKED. \n\nI live in a predominantly white area outside of Cincinnati that has a 3% black population. I was bullied A LOT at school. I actually had to switch schools at one point because it got so bad. Someone put a noose in my cubby. Then, in high school, I cut off my hair and went natural (no relaxers) which was a big decision for me. Well apparently it was \""distracting\"". When I was in the theater program, they only had 1 set of stage makeup for black people... 3 tones too dark for my skin (to put it in perspective, there were 10 total options. The next darkest was probably meant for latinx people).\n\nIt was middle school/high school when I realized I wasn't straight. I was scared shitless. My parents told me to tell noone because I live in a fairly conservative town. When I got crushes on people who weren't men I was terrified and felt ashamed. Teachers blatantly told me same-sex marriage was bad.\n\nNow,as I start my first year on Monday, I realize I want to be the teacher I needed. When we went to school to become an educator, we learned that students need to feel safe in order to learn effectively. A student worrying about their parent getting deported, getting beat up for their sexual orientation, being catcalled in the street or being killed by police does NOT feel safe.

JLewish559,1596291901,,,856,i1t0ka,11580,teachers,"""I'm just stupefied by some of my colleagues. I teach with 20 in my department (science) and I've talked to at least 8 that think Covid-19 is in *some way* a hoax. Or that \""the numbers aren't real\"". I have heard Facebook-spread talking points like \""It has a 99% survival rate\"" or \""It's been around since last October. We have all probably had it already!\""\n\nI get that skepticism is alright. It's a good characteristic to have, but in the absence of any real evidence to support a claim...you should not be spreading misinformation and basing decisions off of that. A lack of evidence goes against the very crux of scientific investigation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if you are a science teacher and you spread this kind of crap I truly believe you need to leave. **YOU** are the problem with science education in the United States \\[and the world\\].\n\nAs a science teacher I look at the data and think \""That doesn't look great. Maybe schools should stay closed to students and we go virtual,\"" or I just look at what the experts are saying. Because I am not an epidemiologist. But the way some of my colleagues talk you'd think they have their PhD's on the subject.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet out of science teaching and go be a Feng Shui expert. Spread your charlatanism elsewhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: 22 hours later....\n\nI wanted to address a few things here.\n\nFirst, the \""you must not be a scientist\"" remarks--what exactly is unscientific about what I typed here? I specifically stated that I don't know the answer. I am not an expert on everything...no one is an expert on everything. You have to defer to other people that are. If you are a Physicist that wants to build a new kind of bridge then you will have to either go through years of school to become an engineer or you can find one and get their opinion on its structural soundness and utility.\n\nSecond, several times people think they are \""catching me\"" because I state (in some replies) that the CDC put out the IRD (infectious rate of death) to be 0.65%. And so the 99% argument must be a valid one because I am saying it's actually 99.35%! Well, the difference between typing this over reddit and saying it in person is vast. Over reddit, I can at least assume that people understand what that means in terms of number of people dead. In person this is never put into context...you just use it as a point of contention and coldly move on. You use it to be intentionally misleading. 0.65% of 309,000,000 is not a small number let alone the population of the entire globe. And neither is 1% for that matter...\n\nThirdly, back to the \""scientists are curious\"" remarks. And I must not be a scientist because I'm not curious or unwilling to be skeptical. I stated that skepticism is alright, but in the absence of real evidence to support a claim you should not be spreading misinformation. I state multiple times throughout replies that there is possibly something fishy going on with the numbers, but **I DONT KNOW** so I won't jump to any conclusions. It's like looking up and seeing an airplane configuration that you've never seen before and immediately jumping to \""That must have been aliens!\"" even though that's obviously a silly thing to conclude without any evidence other than not knowing what it was.\n\nFinally, I want to be clear that this economic shutdown was a shit-show and I know. Of course I played no role in it. When I saw the numbers in Italy back in March it was *scary*. When the WHO was releasing conflicting information I scoffed at them and thought \""What the fuck is wrong with them?\"" And then Trump started talking about Covid-19 never being a problem here and then injecting sunlight into our veins (??). And then the entire governmental structure seemingly failing to handle this thing properly. There's a difference between being skeptical of what is going on based on real, tangible evidence and being skeptical based on your political standing which is going to color your skepticism and deceive you.\n\nI hope that in 6 months time this is all behind us. That we have a vaccine that is being mass produced and everyone (including our black neighbors, our overweight/obese neighbors, our elderly neighbors, our neighbors with cancer, etc.) can start to feel safer going out into the world. I'm prepared for things to completely turn around because I'm not really taking a stance here. Do I think it will happen based on trends? No...not *quickly*, but I'm sure we will eventually be back to \""normal\"" and look back at this clusterfuck and hopefully learn from it.""","If you teach science and think Covid-19 is a ""hoax"" then please resign",0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/i1t0ka/if_you_teach_science_and_think_covid19_is_a_hoax/,2020-08-01 14:25:01,August,2020

I only got into it because I lost my other job in the private sector during the pandemic. I have a 2nd job with another skill set that i wish not to disclose out of anonymity. The point is, I do the bare-minimum as a high school teacher and do this other job in the afternoon/evening so I am never around the school for anything I\u2019m about to tell you o have happened. \n\nA month ago, during the time in which admin is deciding reappointments for next year, a scandal broke loose, set forth by students I can only describe as dangerous. \n\nA group of my 10th grade girls made a 30 second video of themselves joking around vaping in the bathroom and were saying my name alleging i \u201cf*** someone named becky\u201d and posted it on IG. Someone told the admin and I was immediately sent home with pay and barred from the campus. I was given a letter by the principal and it said I was being investigated for an inappropriate relationship with a student. \n\nFor 9 days I knew absolutely nothing and was left to my imagination to speculate what was going on until the HR investigator called me in for an interview. Then when i saw the video, i was immediately disgusted. Both police and HR questioned all the girls and they said they knew nobody named \u201cbecky\u201d and denied everything in the video to be true. After answering a few basic questions, i was exonerated and told I\u2019d get a letter and just go back to work the next Monday.\n\nDuring the time i was out a student emailed me saying rumors were flying so i told the principal i need him to tell everybody this was all bogus. \n\nWhen i returned, i had to have security and the principal himself in each class at the beginning bc the kids were harassing me and threatening even though it was proven false. What i went thru that day was absolutely awful. It was SO AWFUL. \n\nI had to carry on for a few days but then yesterday, i had my reappointment meeting and was told i would not be offered a contract next year. Before this, i had high marks on all observations and was pretty much developing a great reputation among faculty and students. I was told by my instructional coach i was a \u201cnatural.\u201d \n\nNow im just using my vacation time to unwind and destress from one of the worst things anyone has ever done to me. I realized that these kids had nothing to gain from saying what they said and posting it publicly other than the satisfaction of turning my whole life upside down and destroying my soul. \n\nI already spoke to an attorney who said I had no case for anything. I figured so. \n\nLet my story be a lesson to anyone who gets into teaching even as a casual day-job like i did. You can\u2019t make it work. There are kids out there nowadays who define what evil is. I bet even if i had a little family with a baby at home these kids would still destroy me with no remorse. Again, they actually believed these rumors despite what the principal said. \n\nAnd let me also say that everything that happened was because of how these kids videotape themselves and post it all publicly. \n\nWhat were once learning institutions have now turned into Tiktok challenge courses. Stay the hell away. I pray for the safety and well-being of all good-hearted teachers because those are the ones who always get hung out to dry like i did.\n\nEDIT: When i said \u201ci do the bare minimum\u201d i meant i don\u2019t do anything other than the \u201ctried-and-true\u201d lesson plans that are pre-built by the county, and I don\u2019t do sports/clubs.

I was convinced it was the worst observation ever and was ready to quit. I didn\u2019t quit, I was told they\u2019ve seen observations way worse, and I wasn\u2019t even rated ineffective. I was rated developing, which isn\u2019t good either, but for a second year teacher who never student taught or had guidance I figure I could be worse. The developing rating was for\u2026you guessed it\u2026.classroom management. My school is HUGE on praising the good (even the bare minimum) and restorative justice and all those jazzy words. So I\u2019ve been making some drastic changes, but not in the way admin wants. But it\u2019s working, so I don\u2019t care.\n\nI\u2019ve created a tally system. Every time I have to redirect a student, for any behavior, I add a tally next to their name. 5 tallies in one class = parent notification and office referral. At the end of every class, I put the total number of class tallies in a chart and at the end of every month the class with the fewest tallies will get a big prize (not bullshit school prizes they don\u2019t care about). I\u2019m talking chick fil a catered lunch, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts\u2026stuff they actually want. My students have started holding each other accountable because they really don\u2019t want tallies. I\u2019ve also come up with ways to take away class tallies from the total so that one class is who is bad doesn\u2019t give up halfway through the month (but not individual tallies because students who behave badly still need their parents notified, even if they were angels in the last 10 min of class). The students who don\u2019t care about the prizes and are acting up anyway are getting told off by the kids who do care. They don\u2019t give a shit what I think but they care what their friends think. It\u2019s working phenomenally\u2026.better than any other strategy I\u2019ve ever tried. I struggle the most with the kids who have zero intrinsic motivation, and this has helped me finally come up with something that resonates with them. They love the competition and I\u2019m finally getting to teach. The students are also getting a visual representation through tally marks of just how often I have to stop doing my job (teaching) to correct their behavior. \n\nBut admin hates it because I\u2019m \u201clooking for bad behavior instead of praising the good.\u201d\u2026but that strategy wasn\u2019t working for me. I literally can never win in admin\u2019s eyes\u2026but I finally feel like I\u2019m winning in the classroom- participation is better, grades are improving, and bullying in my room has magically stopped. So admin can shove it.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m seeing a fair amount of comments that this is collective punishment and against the law, against the Geneva Convention, a War Crime, etc. but I\u2019m genuinely curious about where that leap is coming from. Collective punishment is punishing a group of people for the actions of a few. I\u2019m not punishing my classes at all. They aren\u2019t getting extra work, they aren\u2019t getting recess taken away, they aren\u2019t getting lunch detention. I\u2019m not punishing the bad classes, I\u2019m rewarding the good ones. Right? The good students in every class have always been rewarded for their behavior through incentives in my class as well as school-wide ones. This is just an added one on the whole-class level. \n\nEDIT #2: I didn\u2019t think this had to be said but if a child has an IEP, 504, or BIP those students\u2019 plans are followed first and foremost and those students do not get penalized for manifestations of whatever the reason for their accommodations may be. The tallies are for students who display disruptive behaviors and interrupt the education of other students in class because they think it\u2019s funny or that they are above the rules.

The first day was last week and I had told all of my department members I was going to do it. Some of them even helped set it up.\n\nThe day went hilariously.\n\nI wrote up on the board \""INSTRUCTIONS: Introduce yourself to as many people as you can and tell your *best* story!\"" I had different coworkers come into my class period at the beginning of each prep and tell the students Mr. Augustane was running late making copies. My students were to begin the activity without me until I arrived.\n\nI wore a hoodie over my dress shirt and tie and brought one of my old backpacks. During the periods I sat down in the seats and introduced myself as the new student named 'Jeremy Lin' and told some of my best stories. Dates and age were changed of course, haha. About 5-10 minutes after introducing myself and hearing several students' stories, I would step to the front of the class and stand on a table, then reveal myself... to the shock of all of my students. It was pretty funny how some students who were quite ~~caddy~~ catty looked when they realized who I was.\n\nIn one period in particular, however, I was seated next to a gentleman who proceeded to tell me \""Oh man, this period is going to go APESHIT.\"" The conversation continued like this:\n\nHim: I had [name], [name], and [name] in my ___ class last year and we ~~wrecked~~ wreaked havoc.

I don't think he'll be any good.\n\n\nAt that moment, I put my hand on his shoulder, and said something along the lines of \""Don't worry buddy, I'm sure I'll do fine.\"" before stepping up to the class and revealing myself.

A parent wanted to send me a graduation announcement for their kid, which is awesome and I genuinely think their kid is freaking amazing! However, I told them to just send it to the school and I'll get it (I teach at a vocational school and not at their kid's main school). They got upset because they wanted to send it to my personal address because it would \""mean more\"" and \""be more personalized\"". I told them I wasn't comfortable giving out my information to anybody and that I hoped they understood.\n\nCome yesterday, I got called to my principal's office and had a meeting with them and the parent because they were upset. They said they felt like I was calling them a stalker or a danger to me because I wouldn't give them my personal address. \ud83e\udd23 My principal didn't know this was coming because the parent lied to them on what the meeting was about and told the parent that I wasn't mandated to give any information out.\n\nParents are some of the dumbest creatures on this planet...and I'm including sloths in that statement.\n\nEDIT:: I'm gonna go ahead and add in this edit to say I still think sloths are dumb, but they ARE adorable. \ud83d\ude02 I'm not one to go back on my word and I don't want y'all to think that, but I just know I love sloths to death and shout out to the person that referenced the video of the sloth laying down eating the carrots off the plate! Lol\n\nAlso, to answer a question that was brought up, I have no idea what the parent said to get the meeting, but all I know is that they lied to set it up and the principal didn't know what was going on other than they were mad at me.

He says, \u201cor what?\u201d And I tell him, \u201cor I can call school security to escort you out and then end the day with a phone call to your dad. This is not a negotiation and I am not going to waste time explaining to you how a 13 year old is supposed to behave. If you want to spend today not learning anything, then sit down and distract yourself, the rest of your classmates actually came here to accomplish something.\u201d \n\nHe immediately sits down. Now this kid thrives off of attention, hates being removed from the classroom, and it\u2019s important to note his father is extremely involved and does NOT let him mess around, so he hates when you call him. This kid also doesn\u2019t like \u201closing\u201d and I can tell he is FUMING that I\u2019ve \u201cchallenged him.\u201d \n\nSo he starts doing that thing kids do where they mutter loudly under their breath because they want you and the class to hear what they say, but also want plausible deniability if you call them out on it. \n\nHe\u2019s talking about how I\u2019m a bitch and it doesn\u2019t really bother me, but it\u2019s distracting, so I turn around and ask him if he wants to share something with the class. \n\nHe says it louder, and I respond in a flat, monotone voice with no facial expression, absolutely I am, thank you for pointing out the obvious.\u201d Some of the kids giggle and one says \u201cMs._____ stays unbothered.\u201d And this sets the kid off even more...so he threatens me. \n\n\u201cYou always talk shit because you think being a teacher is going to protect you. You always run your mouth, but I bet if I socked you in the face you wouldn\u2019t keep running it. You better watch out, etc. etc.\u201d\n\nAt this point I\u2019ve had it with this kid, and to be frank, with all kids that are under the impression that we as teachers are pushovers or don\u2019t have comebacks just because we exercise self-control and have certain things we can\u2019t say/do without fear of losing our jobs, so I respond in probably not the most professional manner.\n\nI tell him I in fact, do know how to fight and that my hands are rated 18+ when it comes to boxing. I tell him I\u2019m not going to risk my job over a student that lacks the ability to shut his mouth for more than three seconds, but if he manages to graduate high school, he can find me afterwards and I\u2019ll be more than happy to meet his threats in kind. I tell him if it\u2019s a fight he wants, just remember my email and we can arrange it in about six years.\n\nHe goes home and tells his mom (it\u2019s her week with him) and the next thing I know I have a meeting with her and the principal.\n\nI was fully expecting to be fired, and at this point I\u2019m so exhausted that I couldn\u2019t really bring myself to care, so imagine my shock when I tell admin my side of the story and he tells me not to speak in the meeting and let him handle everything.\n\nThe mom comes in screaming talking about I threatened her son and he feels unsafe, yadda yadda. The principal cuts her off and says if anything her son threatened me and that I\u2019m traumatized. He looks at me to back up his claim and I nod my head yes.\n\nHe says that if both I and my student feel like we cannot be in the same classroom, then it is his duty to protect both of us and maybe it\u2019s time for her son to be moved to a different class group (the behavior issue pod). The son starts panicking because he doesn\u2019t want to be removed from all his friends and the mom starts cussing out the principal saying that\u2019s not his decision. \n\nHe tells her she\u2019s absolutely right, it\u2019s mine because I\u2019m the one the kid threatened. The kid immediately started apologizing to me and begging to be allowed to stay. I asked for the weekend to think about it and my principal said absolutely. Since then, I\u2019ve received three emails, one from the dad apologizing for the son\u2019s behavior and telling me to do as I see fit, one from the mom saying I\u2019m ruining her son\u2019s middle school experience, and one from the kid apologizing and begging me not to switch him. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t, but based off the kids reaction I actually kind of feel guilty for moving him. At the same time, he causes all the teachers and a fair amount of the students a massive headache on a daily basis. I still don\u2019t know what to decide.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for all the advice and support, it is very much appreciated and I wish I could respond to each and every one of you.\n\nI reached out to my team members through text and it was quickly decided that the kid needs to be removed. While we all differed on for what length of time (one of my coworkers wanting him gone for the rest of the year), we decided on a month trial basis. Now we are not going to tell him it is only a month, but we think any less than that would not show us whether or not there is a true behavior change. We will draft a contract with all our signatures saying that he has to earn his way back into the classroom and if the behavior returns, he will be sent back to the behavior pod with no chance of return for the rest of the year. \n\nI do want to address some of the hate messages I got, as it is clear many people don't now what it is like to be a teacher in this current climate. \n\n1. For those saying I should have just \""called the security the first time,\"" our school only has security once a week, on random days, and we are never notified when they are on campus. When a kid is being extremely bad, you just have to hope that either A) security is there, or B) the threat of calling them is enough to make the kid calm down. Schools are severely understaffed across the board - there is a lack of teachers, paraeducators, bus drivers, janitors, etc. Some of our classes have 36 kids in them at a time and that amount is already hard to juggle when they are al well-behaved. So for those of you criticizing me, or claiming that this could never happen because kids could not possibly be this bad, put your money where your mouth is and come volunteer at your local public school. \n\n2. For those asking me why I hadn't moved him to the behavior pod already, I think you are severely overestimating the amount of power teachers have. That decision is almost never left up to us. In this case, this student has had so many complaints of violence and disrespect documented that the school is finally able to do something. Teachers deal with verbal and mental abuse on a daily basis, and this last year is some of the worst I have seen when it comes to them actually facing physical violence. A kid told one of our teachers she hopes her baby has a miscarriage and dies, and another kid punched our PE teacher in the face when he tried to break up a physical altercation and was allowed back into the school a week later. \n\n3. For those of you telling me to take time out my day to \""mentor\"" him. I know you mean well, but I genuinely ask you with what time am I supposed to do that? Teachers already work 20-40 extra unpaid hours a week. Most that I know dedicate 5 am to 8 pm doing lesson planning, grading, making parent phone calls, creating seating charts, etc. The only time would be after school, and I am not meeting one-on-one with a kid who threatened to punch me in the face. Nor, to be frank, should I have to. I have a lot of students who I have built personal connections with, who feel like they can trust me, who tell me my classroom is their safe space. These kids have overcome some crazy adversities, and yes, at the beginning of the year, some of them did not like me/talked back to me; but never did they threaten me, and that makes all the difference to how far I am willing to go for them. Sorry-not sorry. \n\n4. Lastly, for those who are claiming I actually did \""threaten\"" the child, you are intentionally ignoring the fact that I stated I would never get into a physical fight with a minor. I meant it when I told him there is no point in trying to fight me, because I am not going to put my hands on a child; however, just because he is a kid does not mean he gets to make threats to my physical safety. Half of my students are way bigger than me, and their age does not preclude them from actually being able to hurt me. No one has the right to threaten to punch someone in the face because they didn't get their way and just because were adults doesn't mean we have to let them. In the real world, if a 13 year old walked up to an adult who wasn't a teacher and tried to fight them, that adult would have every right to fight them back. The kids should learn sooner or later, before they find themselves facing assault charges as adults.\n\nNow it is time for me to be a bit rude, but I feel I have to be a bit blunt with some of the parents in this sub. I hate to break it to some of you, but you have failed at your job. When teachers returned to the classroom after COVID lockdown, we dully expected their to be academic and maturity deficits, what we did not expect was for you to neglect your child for damn near two years and not teach them how to be good people. Some of you confuse the responsibilities of parenting and teaching. It is not up to us to teach your children how to be good people, they should be learning that at home, and if they aren't, chances are it is because you are not equipped to teach them because you yourself are not a good person. We have to stop using trauma as an excuse for kids being extremely disrespectful. There are people who spent their childhoods during great world wars, who spent their childhoods facing constant unfettered racism, who spent their childhoods unable to even think about being true to their identities because of the brutal time period they lived in, yet we are only seeing these off the wall behaviors emerge in the last ten years.

Jeromiewhalen,1493865347,,,781,694yxi,7415,teachers,"""Edit #2: This blew up, so I wanted to put at the top if they ever see this: THANK YOU YEARBOOK CREW! Deadline is tomorrow and they are still working as we speak (12:00 AM EST). Your hard work is why it's worth it!\n\nI wrote this as a comment in a post today but I feel like it needs to stand on it's own as well. To start: I don't work for Treering, but this all came out of a post about potentially switching to Treering for yearbooks. I think it's really important to understand how Jostens did the smoke and mirrors routine for years until they finally got caught. Here it goes:\n\nAs technology teacher, I took over yearbook advising last year to raise funds for our tech department. Immediately upon taking over I was sent invoices from Jostens in the amount of ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. What? How do we OWE for a yearbook that costs $78 (price goes from $55 to $78 by the end)? Where is the money going? That question led me down the biggest and shadiest rabbit hole I have ever seen. \n\nFirst, when asked to send an itemized invoice, Jostens was hesitant. Finally, after persistence, I got it, and low and behold the numbers just didn't add up.\n\nWhy? Well first off I had nothing to go off of because they had not sent a contract IN THREE YEARS, so I could not even refute pieces of any agreement. Secondly, a line item showed up in the top right in small print on our invoice saying \""production fee\"". What was this? After pressing again, Jostens was making us pay $100 FOR THE FIRST 50 BOOKS, AND WE WERE SELLING THEM FOR $55 a piece! That's right; our kids were buying books for negative fundraiser profit. No mention of this in any contract. No mention of this even on the line items in the itemized invoice. Nothing.\n\nSo I go down the lines and - oh hey! - we are getting charged ~~$1500~~ $860 for \""advertising materials\"", . Sweet. I never asked for this, you just sent a box of posters. If we made them ourselves it would have cost us maybe $50. But tack on another ~~$1500~~$860, awesome.\n\nSo I'm already at our wits end by the time the books arrive, and things get even better. I count the books and while we ordered 320, we received ~~375~~365. Why do we have so many extras? JOSTENS SENT US THEM WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION, AND CHARGED US! They claimed it was for kids who forgot to order them so we could sell them, but if you look at the numbers of books it conveniently brought the small amount of profit we made to zero. They then want you to return the books by a certain date (usually in the summer) for a credit refund. JOSTENS ZEROS YOU OUT WITH EXTRA BOOKS AND HOPES YOU DON'T SEND THEM BACK.\n\nYou think that's the end? Oh boy, not even close.\n\nSo after months of being pushed around, I made it one of my absolute priorities to get these kids the most money I could back. I nit-picked every little detail, knowing full well that Jostens had no legal ground on things because no contract was signed and our students had paid a lot of money to this shady company. I argued about advertising, I contested them about the extra books, everything. In all, Jostens waived around $5000 in money owed. Think about that for a second. Jostened erased ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. at the wave of a wand. If you can magically erase ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34 out of nowhere, what does that mean for the charge to begin with?\n\nSo finally satisfied that I could be rid of the plague that is Jostens for ~~$1,400~~ $1,475.82, we sent paperwork to our downtown financials to pay our balance and move one. That should be the end of the story right?\n\nWrong. Downtown gets back to us and notices that JOSTENS IS CHARGING US TAX ON OUR YEARBOOKS. They collected taxes that never existed, to the tune of ~~$1600~~ $1,614.79. So, livid, I send an email to JOSTENS demanding our payment record for the entirety of our relationship with them and find THEY DID THIS FOR FOUR YEARS. They claimed that they needed a new tax exempt sheet from us but we never sent it in. They had the old one, which is THE SAME NUMBER as a new one, but that's what the problem was. They are supposed to be cutting a check to us now for around $6000 (5/11 update: they cut one for $2,737, trying to figure out that now). Now think about how many schools use Jostens and how many schools they potentially did that to. That's a class action lawsuit in the millions of dollars right there.\n\nMy blood pressure is up just writing this. They have basically robbed our students for years, and it happens all the time because advisors come and go and rarely have time like I did to catch them and call them on their crap.\n\nSo we went with Treering this year. First off, I came in with fangs and demands from the get go because I was so pissed off and jaded from Jostens. I started mentioning everything to the guy and listed all my needs in what I wanted contract wise and he was like \""yeah our contract is one page long.\"" It's literally one page long (front and back). The next thing I asked was the base price, which came out to $35.62 (140 pages, estimated 300 books sold). JOSTENS BASE PRICE WITH ALL THE HIDDEN FEES WAS $58. They were going to bump it down to $40 (so generous!) when I told them we were firing them.\n\nSo our Jostens ones sold for $78, and now we sell them at $60. So that's $18 LESS per book and $25 MORE in fundraising money. We went from owing Jostens $3k last year to [raising over $7000 this year](http://imgur.com/a/WYUgM). I have learned that we can do discounts for students with free and reduced lunch, so our goal is to make the books equitable for all students. I think you can do this with Jostens as well, but I didn't have the time during my battle to find out.\n\nI love my students and defend them rabidly, and seeing how Jostens treated our school makes me sick. Go do the math on how much Jostens (or ANY yearbook company for that matter) is making on your school and you will be too. I would be upset about any swindling, but public school kids? Our free and reduced kids could never afford even discounted books because prices got out of hand, and all because of shifty tactics and corporate greed.\n\nSo on the technical side, Treering is not a big improvement from Jostens software, but I do like the linking with social media and especially Flickr. We post all of our pictures to Flickr for the kids to view, print and share during the year for free, then we can automatically grab from albums and place. The themes are good, a lot to choose from too.\n\nI could go on, and if you want to talk more please PM me, I try to tell anyone that will listen this story because it really is an injustice. \n\n*********\nEdit: Admins banned post for \""self promotion\"", so link removed. \n*********\n\nOh man that felt therapeutic getting out!\n\nEdit #1: thank you to u/behemothpanzer for submitting to r/bestof , I have put so many hours into fighting this small battle that no one knew about or cared about and it really means a lot to me to see such support. I also wanted to add that I don't just have problems with Jostens, other yearbook companies have done shady things too and I don't even know them. This was from a post at the bottom of the comments about a yearbook company essentially trying to bribe me:\n\nAnother thing I didn't point out is that other companies try to lure you in with free gifts. A company told me they would [give me a free $50 gift card just for meeting with them.](http://imgur.com/dAwATtz) Like ME a gift card.

I tried to respond to everyone, and if I missed you I'm sorry I will try tomorrow. It's late hear but I was too pumped about your support!

Is there something I could be doing more to help the students feel more comfortable to go and take care of themselves to avoid this, or is this something that 'just happens'? I haven't really seen this until recently (unless I was oblivious the first 7-8) years of teaching).\n\nEdit: some great advice. I'll talk with a counselor to help bring awareness. My goal is to not bring unwanted attention to it more for fear of embarrassing the girls affected. I'll see if I can find a casual, indirect way to help them understand it's normal, and if they can, let me know so I can help them avoid any embarrassment. I'll look into getting some products in my room.\n\nEdit 2: I'm also sorry to hear some were bullied for something natural. I try my best to keep my ears open and prevent that where I can.

A senior decided, on his very last day of school, to literally piss on a teacher.  \n\nThe seniors went way overboard with their pranks. They broke into the school after the overnight custodians left at 2:00am. They pulled desks and chairs out into the halls, stacked them into piles so that no one could get thru the halls. \n\nThere were chairs piled in the lunchroom, and just about everyplace they shouldn't be. \n\nThe kicker is when the senior decided to piss on a older teacher.

Me. \n\nI guess this is my own personal Karen moment, because as my non-teacher family and friends say, \u201cBoys will be boys!\u201d But I don\u2019t remember kids being this stupid when I was their age\u2026 \n\nJust something so disturbing about hearing tween/teen/elementary boys making what they think are women\u2019s \u201csex noises\u201d constantly.\n\nEnd rant.\n\nEdit to add: For all of you saying, \u201cThis has been a thing since the 1800\u2019s!\u201d I teach ELEMENTARY school. The point is: this is happening younger and younger. And it doesn\u2019t stop with the moaning, at my school alone boys were tea bagging each other, describing sex acts to each other and girls, accusing boys of having sexual relations with each other and bullying relentlessly, and pretending to deep throat anything phallic (hot dogs, recorders) with gurgling sounds. It is more rampant and deliberately to be heard by the entire room than it was in your day and age, the retiring teachers in my school have never witnessed anything like it. \n\nIf you\u2019re cool with boys making girls and other boys in class feel uncomfortable for the sake of \u201cboys being boys,\u201d just say it. \n\nThe amount of predators in the comment section doesn\u2019t pass the vibe check.""",I am permanently traumatized from the amount of boys moaning in class this year,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/14go727/i_am_permanently_traumatized_from_the_amount_of/,2023-06-23 03:58:37,June,2023

This just happened. I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nIt\u2019s my first year teaching at an elementary school. Second grade. \n\nSo basically Im female and I have a wife, 3 year old, and 6 month old twins. I love my family. And when introducing myself to students, I said that I have a wife and kids to my students. And that\u2019s it. I didn\u2019t know that was so wrong, because every other teacher also does it. Right? I never mentioned it again or anything. It was just part of my introduction. \n\nEverything was normal for a while, just teaching. Until one day a parent requested a meeting and I of course said yes. In the meeting, the mom was angry at me saying I\u2019m trying to indoctrinate her daughter. I told her that that was not my intention at all. But she kept going and going very angry. By the end she stormed out saying she\u2019s reporting me to the district and getting me fired. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d actually do it. I was just so nervous the entire time. But she did, and a little later, the superintendent wants a meeting with me without saying what about but I had a feeling. \n\nIn the meeting, he was saying that I should refrain from mentioning my family. I said I never said anything about it except introducing. He was being really annoying, shutting down everything I had to say. It felt so unfair. Like I was being targeted. Basically by the end, he threatened to fire me :) So fun. \n\nThe following week I was being watched by an admin. My classroom being observed from the start of school to the end. And he told me to take down my picture frame of a photo of me, my wife, and our children. Which was sitting on my desk. \n\nThis whole week kinda sucked. I just wanted to rant. That\u2019s all. I don\u2019t really know what to do but I\u2019ll just listen. I love teaching a lot. It\u2019s always been my dream. I could be in the wrong. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just so nervous about the entire thing. Sorry for the long post\n\n\nEDIT: I was going to make another post but I don\u2019t have that much to say. So I\u2019ll put it in here. Thank you guys for all the help. I didn\u2019t think it would get this much. Today is Sunday and I talk with the union  on Wednesday. Also I\u2019ve been looking for a lawyer with the help of my Mother in law because she used to work in law. And filing a discrimination lawsuit, maybe. Depending on what happens. Thank you guys for the help and I won\u2019t take down the photo. I live in Texas but in a somewhat more liberal part. We\u2019ve been wanting to move to California for a long while now.
