khalashtar,1bc9fku,Article,41,533,"To preface, I have already put in my two weeks and was about halfway through. I made a post a couple of days ago detailing how my boss chewed me out over getting help from a coworker. After that day, I thought everything was said and done till the next morning when my boss once again called me into his office. He accused me having coworkers in MY office (like, why am I getting in trouble? I didn‚Äôt invite them, and regardless I have an open door policy and love to help and answer questions where I can. Also, I was leaving in about a week, so people would often stop and talk or say goodbye) for FOUR HOURS. If anything, the few coworkers who DID stop by were there for 10-15 minutes at most, and would stop by from time to time for various reasons. Then, after I tried to reason and defend myself and my coworkers, he cut me off and told me it looked bad on me and that upper management had made comments. After that, he said something that absolutely shocked me: ‚Äúyou know, we didn‚Äôt have to keep you after you put in your two weeks. But we vouched for you.‚Äù Keep in mind, the only reason I put in two weeks to begin with is because its the professional thing to do. I have another job lined up. I would have loved to just quit lol. This was the bullshit I was tired of. I was shocked and nearly in tears. There was another person in his office awkwardly sitting there. I was overall just humiliated. After I left his office I cried a bit in my own office and packed all my belongings because I was debating walking out. I thought about it over the weekend and decided I would just flat out quit on Monday morning, which I did. He was shocked? How can you be shocked after lowkey waving the threat of being fired around?

Or that if the name of the role was one that is familiar to them, then the work would be totally familiar as well? Maybe it's just me... Please... Ask detailed questions of the people on the other side of the table/screen/etc. Not just about pay and benefits -- which are important considerations -- but about the daily workflow, what orientation and onboarding look like, what the expectations will be for the first week and month, and what success would look like after a year in this role. Ask about the areas where previous employees have struggled, and what would be needed to avoid those pitfalls. This is not just so you will know what success looks like (from their perspective), but you will have a sense of if it is the kind of success you want to be pursuing. That's a major objective of the interview process for the candidate -- know what you are getting into. *(BTW, this is why giving your salary requirements at the beginning of the interview process, before you have figured any of this out, puts the candidate at a disadvantage.

bad-in-plaid,1bcibmc,Leaving a job,9,12,"I was laid off in December by a company where I worked for over 7 years. It was a true shock. I was sad and scared, and threw myself into applying and interviewing for every job posting I could find. I had a lot of interviews but also a lot of rejections. A couple weeks ago, I was offered a job by a company that requires 5 days a week in the office, and is a 90 minute commute from where I live, neither of which are ideal to say the least. It paid about the same as I was making before being laid off, which translates to a loss when you factor in the long commute and office time. I agonized over whether I should wait for something better to come along, but they gave me only two days to decide on the offer (and refused to extend more time) and wanted me to start within the week. It was an offer and I've been unemployed for months, so even though they wouldn't negotiate on the salary, I accepted the job and started last Friday. Here's where the trouble started. On Friday afternoon, after a welcome lunch bought by my new colleagues, I got a call from a company I had interviewed with weeks before and had assumed I was no longer under consideration for. They offered me the job (same title) at a higher salary, and fully remote. I think it's a better fit for my skills and certainly for my lifestyle. It's a no brainer for me to accept. But now I'm going to have to quit on my third day on the job at the first company. It's an extremely small company (5 people) and I'm their first hire who they haven't had a prior relationship with. They're all extremely nice and have been so kind and welcoming. I know I'm putting them in a bad position, as they hired me so quickly because they're extremely busy, and they wasted time and money hiring and onboarding me. I am in a 90 day probationary period where I'm able to quit or be terminated without notice, so technically I'm in the clear, but morally I feel awful about it and I'm worried about what the consequences might be for future job searches. The time after my layoff has been the worst in my life and this is really just adding another layer of awfulness. I know I have to do what's best for me in the end but just hoping to maybe hear some reassurance that I'm making the right decision.

melkijades,1bc1f09,Office relations,7,13,"For some background, I recently joined a small team within a Europe-based international institution. In total, there are six of us: three employees, two interns, and our manager. My role is quite interesting, I am paid very well, and it provides valuable experience for my CV. However, my manager epitomizes a micromanaging boss! As I write this, he could be looking over my shoulder - no joke. He is in his early 60s (just for some context, I am in my mid-30s) and is one of those old-school individuals who arrives at work at 8 AM and doesn't leave until 6-7 PM (sometimes I go out to walk the dog and I still see the light in his office switched on, LOL). My employer has a policy in place for working from home, allowing us to work remotely for two days. In my first week, he subtly pressured me to only work from home for one day, but I addressed the issue and managed to secure two days. Today (Monday) is one of these agreed-upon remote work days, and I stayed at home. However, I have just received a semi-passive-aggressive email from him, questioning why I didn't come to the office this morning. After reminding him that we agreed on Monday and Wednesday as my work-from-home days, he stated that he didn't receive any official email from me, and that our oral agreement isn't valid without an email. In comparison, other teams have much more flexibility, as long as there is agreement on the days when everyone is in the office. Even then, they exercise a greater level of flexibility. Speaking of working from home, he never takes advantage of this option himself, and is present in the office five days a week. He is a workaholic who enjoys spending time in the office. Since his wife does not work, she takes care of household tasks while he is at work (such as taking out the garbage, going to the post office, receiving deliveries, cleaning, etc.), while I live alone and don't have the luxury to delegate such responsibilities. As a result I do these tasks during the weekend and I always end up feeling dreadful. He wants to know every detail about what I (and the rest of the team) do on a daily basis. He frequently comes into my office to inquire about my current tasks. He insists on being CC'd in every email and rarely use MS Teams (preferring to communicate via email, even for minor and insignificant matters). Another example occurred last week, when I produced 40 content pieces/files and sent them to him. One of the files had a spelling mistake in its name. He took a screenshot of the file name and asked me to rename it, which came about two hours after he had asked me to prioritize another task. It would literally take him 2 secs to rename the file, instead he opted to do a screenshot, crop it, upload it and send it via email. What a complete waste of time! We have weekly one-on-one catch-up meetings scheduled for 30 minutes, but they typically last between 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. The rest of the team feels the same way, and when we have rare moments alone, everyone expresses their frustration with our manager. However, they have learned to tolerate the micromanagement as they are content with the generous salary and other benefits. To be very honest, he is an incredibly smart and eloquent person with a tone of relevant experience (he started our as a journalist for the Economist and NYT, and later switched to international affairs), speaks 3 languages.... but he is just very uncreative, controlling and lacks proper time management skills for a person of his position. I noticed that even our 2 interns are better managing their time than him! As a result of all of this I feel deeply unhappy and I have already started applying to other jobs. Any tips on how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated.

I'm doing the same job that I'm trained to do, but this assignment is nearly double the volume that I'm used to and I do it anymore. I'm going into overtime (which is not great because I'm hourly and OT is case-by-case), skipping lunch, and just generally dreading work every single minute I'm not working. I also suffer from some mental illnesses My manager is great and she's super supportive and has been trying to help me reduce my workload, but I don't think I've been able to properly communicate to her how bad off I've been mental health wise because my work is still getting done well and there haven't been any complaints regarding my performance. I need to figure out a way to tell her that I am close to crashing and burning and that I need a big change. I can't really ask to be taken off of the STA because there isn't any work for me to do in my usual area. I really don't want to leave the company but I'm at a point where my mental health is severely impacted. This sucks because I'm generally regarded as a high performer and I really don't want that reputation tarnished, but I also don't want to end up in a psych ward. Any advice on how to communicate this to her in a professional way? I really try to not overshare at work and I keep my wellbeing and mental health pretty private for the most part so I'm not sure how much detail I should be going into when discussing this with her. She'll be receptive no matter what, so that's not really my concern, I just need to be able to share without throwing up any red flags or having HR get involved at all if I say too much.

talksaboutdogs,1bccmx5,Leaving a job,0,0,"Hi there! TLDR first: 16 years at one company. Many positions at the company. No raise/review in 6 years. Updating my resume seems daunting. I've worked for my company for 16 years now. I don't know that I ever intended to stay here this long but my company started as a close-knit feel and I felt like I was appreciate/valued until about 5 years ago and I've stayed. I was happy here until recently. Long story short, lots has happened in life and at work and it occurred to me that I haven't had a performance review in 6 years, nor any kind of raise (including a basic cost of living raise). It's getting to a point where I'm dipping into savings to cover my living expenses so I requested a performance review/ request for raise in April of last year. So far no performance review has been granted and when I follow up, I'm told many different reasons for the delay by upper management. I'm at a point now where I am no longer feeling as understanding and patient as I was - I'm struggling to make ends meet and 20/hr since 2017 seems wholly unfair. Having worked here since 2008 and worn many hats for the company, I've also held side jobs for extra income but those side gigs were offered to me without me seeking out the positions. I did not finish college and as such I feel awful about myself in terms of being able to secure a better job. The task of updating/refreshing/revamping my resume is very daunting and I'm starting to feel disheartened.

RisshoAnkoku,1bc8ll6,Post-interview,0,1,"I work in a large MNC and had recently applied for an internal role. Before my application, I had a detailed chat with the hiring manager and felt excited about the opportunity. Post our chat, the hiring manager reached out with follow-up questions regarding my skill set. I hadn't applied yet. After applying, I get an interview call from one of the counterparts of the hiring manager. The interview went quite well. A week later, a formal interview with the hiring manager takes place which goes well past the scheduled time and is more like a general chat about the role and my experience. At the end, upon asking for the next steps, I am told that there might be an interview with the global head of the team as the candidate will spend considerable time working with them and gives a passing reference that they will need a pipeline of 3 - 4 candidates and abruptly says thank you and ends the interview. It has been more than a week since and I have not heard anything back. Both my interviews were mere conversations about my career and only 30% time was spent in technical assessment. I know I am overthinking but I am just left confused about what exactly is happening here. The recruiter had told me there would be just two rounds and now I am told there might be another one.

chemistry1990,1bc7oyw,Evaluations,1,1,"I‚Äôll try to make this short. I work in a pharmaceutical company as a senior chemist. For about 4 years, I reported to my supervisor (we will call her Iris). Iris got promoted to the head of our department last year. Iris informed me last year that my direct supervisor will be changed as she cannot manage senior chemists in her new role. She can only supervise managers or team leads. Therefore, she contacted HR to move me to a different supervisor, her will call her Vicky. Vicky is very kind, understands my work ethic, is hard working, and I have much to learn from her. We work well together. Here comes the problem‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Iris still gives me tasks to do everyday without checking in with Vicky. Vicky gets annoyed by this but doesn‚Äôt say anything to Iris. Last week, I took a sick day and told Vicky I wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it in. Vicky understood and said she hoped that I felt better. The next day when I came in, Iris asked to be informed when I took a sick day. She said it wasn‚Äôt a big deal but she needed to know when I am present and when I am not. When I told her that I informed my direct supervisor, Iris then told me she did not see Vicky until the end of the day so she had no way to know. I was a little annoyed by this but I let it go‚Ä¶.until I spoke to Vicky today. Vicky told me that she informed Iris immediately in the morning that I would be absent.

I am reporting to Vicky who doesn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing every day. How is Vicky supposed to properly evaluate me if I‚Äôm not actually reporting to her? Iris only wants me to work for her without actually taking responsibility of me as an employee under her. Am I over reacting to this by being frustrated and angry with Iris?

wildersonek,1bc7gvx,Career development,0,0,"I joined a job like 8 months back. It was fine in start and I was also like on auto pilot mode. Just getting up and going to work without thinking much. Slowly, some started telling me about minor issues but I wasn't paying attention. Issue is that company policy is very reactive and weird. You get 1 WFH in a week but you can't get it on Monday. You can't get it before or after an annual leave. You can't take if more than 5 people are taking on that day. It's annoying and it's just simple thing I'm saying, it feels like they want to control time after work too. They shouldn't care if work is getting done but more focus is on 9 hours at office, sitting there. Some people are getting more sick offs and WFH as they are on good terms, I got 4 sick off in winter and was poked about it to take care of health. Plus, sitting for 9 hours is exhausting. The work is not like you have to be in office, most people will do more efficiently from home but it's getting pretty annoying and I'm just controlling myself from reacting to HR. On paper it's flexible company but their rules kind of feels like that have something to say on our free time too. Feels like a school. Anyways, earlier than this I was doing a permanent remote job. I'm looking for any pointers for skills I should learn or profiles I should Target. My family has small business but I feel a bit worried if I'll be able to manage it well. But I do feel like it can be challenging but a bit better than feeling stuck in corporate. I do know it's all about culture. There are companies with a lot better culture and freedom but still. I'm so divided on what to pursue and which way to go. Business then I have to figure out my way of interest and pour my all. I know might sound like silly rant but I'm 27, I gotta make a particular decision and run on that path now. I can't keep on delaying being divided in the options. It's either getting a very flexible, good cultured firm job or doing my own thing. Can be weird but can you people point at some emerging businesses and tracks I should look at? Or some pointers for how to figure out my best business plan. I have studied design thinking in college and back then it felt like I was so full of ideas, now after like 3 years, in which Covid was there too, feels like my ideas are lost and I can't think it all the way and make a plan, like I learned back then in startup foundry.","Culture/Policy issues, makes it exhausting.

I understand that it‚Äôs to promote punctuality, but I‚Äôve never owned a car and I‚Äôve never once been late to work in four years having been working. The main reason I am unable to get access to a car is I have a sleep disorder.

The job itself is ok, I can't see myself doing it in the long term because l've been sick all the time since l've been working there and it's just really affecting my health, but it's ok and I get $550 a month (since I didn't do any training for it have). For the past two weeks l've noticed tension between me and a few other teachers because I'm constantly sick and I also do some of the housekeeping there. I would understand if they fired me (you just can't really count on me because of that). They talk to me irritably on the phone when I have to apologize again and I also understand their point of view. I already had a conversation with my boss about it, who was understanding because the teachers there are also very often sick or have to call in sick. I just don't know what to do anymore. I think the best thing would be to put everything on a break and first find out whether there is something else going on health-wise, but there are no breaks, just getting fired. I have PTSD and depression (currently untreated as my therapists have moved and they're all full) and have had potassium deficiency in the past (which can also affect me, but I have no idea if that's the case right now). I also had a panic attack after a teacher yelled at me about a missing pot that I had forgotten to put on the table. I've been forgetting a lot lately, but l've been told that depression can also affect my memory a lot. I live with my parents and actually wanted to move out in 1 year, but I guess that will have to wait till i'm a little bit more secure. So all in all - I am and feel just unstable and very useless right now. Everyone is dissatisfied with me, my family excludes me and, like me, they already see me getting fired and I just want to finally get something done job-wise. What would you do in my position? I'm just desperate and just hoping that my future doesn't end on the streets. I would literally do any job right now, if that means i will get paid and i'm secure, but nobody wants an uneducated and unstable person. For me, it's not about finding my dream job right now, it's about getting by IN ORDER to be able to afford university when I'm 25 (that's the goal). I would start later, but it would be worth it to me. But I need something to keep me afloat for that long.

Maycrofy,1bbwdz4,Interviews,2,1,"Hello, let me explain the situation: I originally studied Graphic Design, but I'm bilingual and have also worked as a language teacher After I finished university, I was able to get a job as a language teacher for about 8 months. I did that to pay for my dissertation fees (Note that I'm from outside the USA). Once it was paid, I had a string of 3 jobs over the span of the next year and a half as a designer. I did get to learn how to design for clients and operate printers and other gear. So I feel confident in my skills. After that I got a job in a university as a language teacher. I was there for 5 years, from 2018 to 2023. However, the syllabus changed, language learning got hours cut and I was laid off. Most of 2023 I was testing the waters being foreign worker in Canada in a clerk position. While there I did some reflection and decided I do want to get back to my field of studies, since I do like the work atmosphere better than that of education. I came back from canada close to the start of this year. So I've been sending CVs since the year started and had a couple of interviews that didn't select me, I'm also taking freelance jobs to add to my portfolio. In my CV I usually write that I have 2 years experience in one of the places where I got along the best with the manager. I don't know what he'd say about me to a potential employer, I can still reach him to talk about it if I wanted. How should I list the experience that I have? Should I just say it's best to not contact that employer or be honest and list all those jobs? What should I say in the interview? Of course I'm not proud of that period of job hopping in my life, back then I was working in a ""work for the highest bidder"" mindset and only now do I see the effects of that. thanks in advance for any tips.",How to format my resume if I have a spotty work history in my early years?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bbwdz4/how_to_format_my_resume_if_i_have_a_spotty_work/,2024-03-11 06:08:59,Monday,6,March,2024,False

It's like I don't even know if that company actually exists... I always applied in LinkedIn and in the beginning, it was good. I made it to final, done countless interviews, did quite a few assignments, then I realized that LinkedIn may not be the best for me especially when I am not best at doing assignments and interviewing 5 times in a competitve role... When I apply a role there, I see over 100 applicants applied to the job within a few hours!! It's like I don't even know how I can make it to final or needless to say to get hired because I am not as desperate as other candidates. I can live okay without working since I worked many years, but the point is that I am worried about my resume gaps and it's always good to be having income instead of spending money... Now I am switching towards indeed & glassdoor, which tend to be a lot more commission role especially for sales but at least I know I am competing with less people because not everyone is applying in those platforms.

The problem started about a week ago when the manager got back to me callijg me I answered some basic questions and then he said he would get back to me lster that day at 5pm. I waited all day anxious about the second part of the interview as he put it. 5pm comes around and no call so I wait until 6:30pm. The next day I call the job and they said they will have the manager call me when they come in. A few days later they message me saying sorry it took a bit and that they would send me a email for me to do and I should get it by the end of the day... I don't. The next day I message back saying I didn't get it. They say they will resend it... didn't get it again until one or two days later. I complete it they say I completed it. The next day after that they ask if I can come in tomorrow (yesterday) I say yes. They say perfect, I will see you there at 2pm. 2pm comes around I am there at the job 10 minutes early with all the documents I need. I ask if the person is in, the person on the other side of the glass says no. I wait around for a bit until the person asks if they can take my documents to make copies, I agree. I talk to this person because I know what I am getting paid (I don't talk about it though obviously) but I have no clue what day I am stsrting (if I get hired on) or what days I even work to be honest. I get a message (around 2:25ish) saying that I am still awaiting to be hired and my start date is monday... which is confusing to me. Anyways at around 2:30pm the person comes back up to the window where I was waiting for the manager because they said they would see me but it turns out I was just supposed to drop off my documents to be printed and then leave... that would've been nice to know. Anyways I am worried because it sounds like I am hired but not fully, I feel like there is barely ANY communication. It could get better but a part of me feels like I should just walk away from the job (I don't need it, it was supposed to be a side job anyway) I just want to know if I do walk away and don't come in monday would there be like anything against me. not with the company but more like would this be a red flag for others wanting to hire me?

This campaign came to us from the highest level department in our company. It was extremely involved, complicated and stressful because we had a very short deadline. So it's supposed to be a handful of ppl at this presentation including the head of the department. He's not the ceo but one step below. We'll call him Frank. Everyone else can't make it to our presentation. Frank had another engagement, I think news release right after our presentation. He was going to cancel on us but said he didn't want to ""do that to us"" since we ""came all this way"" (literally walked 10 mins from one building to another). So my director starts the PowerPoint and Frank immediately has glazed over eyes. He leaves his ringer on and his phone keeps buzzing. Rude. He's sitting there texting while my director is trying to explain this marketing campaign. He's talking right to him and hes looking At his phone. It comes to my part and I start talking and hes staring at me, not the slide on screen obviously not understanding anything I'm explaining because he missed the first part. Obviously bosses not paying attention during presentations isn't a new thing.

I‚Äôm wanting to just give up and leave simply because of management. Every day we have 1 doctor (my boss who is the owner) and 2 optometrist assistants on shift ( me + someone else ). One does reception and the other does work ups. The thing is everytime I go in since I started my boss is always in my ear. He‚Äôs always asking me what I‚Äôm working on when I‚Äôm clearly working on something right in front of him. This has continued from when I started till now and it‚Äôs driving me up the wall. I‚Äôve noticed that he doesn‚Äôt treat anyone else the way he does me. I‚Äôm always super anxious when I go to work now it‚Äôs just so bad because I feel like I have to go above and beyond for him to get off my back. If I‚Äôm on shift it‚Äôs constantly pulling me aside to talk about workload amongst my coworkers and office duties. Honestly I‚Äôm not a bad worker, I do my job I do what I‚Äôm paid for and go home. What‚Äôs making me question his behavior is that all my other coworkers go above and beyond for him and I just won‚Äôt do that I refuse. He doesn‚Äôt pay us enough to take work home, to do all these extra duties, errands that my other coworkers do. Another reason is that he changes up rules, for example we usually charge for retinal imaging at my office and if u see an ophthalmologist you don‚Äôt have to pay that charge. We‚Äôve been having patients who come in and already do retinal imaging at another doctor so therefore we don‚Äôt do it. He‚Äôs been consistently saying that I‚Äôm trying too hard not to do retinal imaging yet I‚Äôm simply just following the rule he said but he told me we should know when we‚Äôre ‚Äúpushing it‚Äù. He consistently changes up office rules and then blames us if things don‚Äôt go his way and it‚Äôs super discouraging at this point because I feel like nothing I do is right anymore. I usually give a 2 weeks notice for every job I‚Äôve been at but I just simply want to quit. The thing is if I do quit I‚Äôd guarantee would be leaving them short staffed. Since only 2 assistants work a day the work load would go to my coworker and I just feel bad.

Currently I am enrolled into a 2 year automotive collision program as an apprentice. I am quite confused though on what to do currently. Everything has been going well so far with my progress and speaking with my mentor and my GM he thinks I will succeed when the program is over. My main issue is currently I am 3 months in the program and I am hourly at $23 and at 6 months I switch over to flat rate pay as I‚Äôll have some of my classes done for that checkpoint as they do a certain checkpoint every 6 months with classes, icar tests etc. where I‚Äôm stuck is I really want to do this as a career and it is my passion to do this as I have a few cars of my own I want to work on so this will help me learn those skills. I‚Äôm stuck because if I leave the company before 6 months I don‚Äôt owe them the $8687 for the course and if I leave after 6 months to 2 years I owe them that said amount of money from the contract. I‚Äôm just worried because right now at 40 hours a week I‚Äôm bringing home $880 a week if not more with my overtime. And in 3 more months I will be flat rate pay split with my mentor so say if me and him together book 80 hours a week then we‚Äôll split it 50/50 but I‚Äôm just worried about anything less than 80 hours. I know this Industry has a lot of factors you can‚Äôt rely on like insurance and parts coming in wrong or damaged etc but I‚Äôm just worried for my future I suppose because if I get anything less than 40 flagged hours I will not be able to live anymore so I‚Äôm just looking for some insight on what yall would do if you were in my situation. Honestly I think the way the program is set up with the pay wise just doesn‚Äôt settle well with me but the issue is I‚Äôm from Wisconsin and we haven‚Äôt had any big snow storms or anything this year which is odd so that‚Äôs affecting the work coming in with town ins etc. I talked with my GM and on avg the last 7 years he‚Äôs been at this location there is about 300-450 hours of work every month since he‚Äôs been at this location and right now with current situations were lucky to maybe even have 10-20 hours roll though the shop in a week or two. So I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some advice before it‚Äôs too late to withdraw from the program as just my living cost a month right now is $2480.

Temporal_Enigma,1ba5hue,Unemployment,580,774,"One year ago last Sunday I was fired from the job I spent a decade in school trying to get. I had 10 interviews throughout the remainder of 2023 and almost got hired again, but they pulled out last minute when the person reviewing my application saw I was fired, even though we discussed it in the interview (different person doing the review.) Since March 2023, I have only been employed for a 3 month contract and moved back to my home state. I have been trying since November to find a job closer to my field with no luck. Recently, I started trying to find literally any job. I thought I had a job as an Amazon driver, but I was rejected because I got two tickets in the last year (the only 2 tickets I've ever had.) I had an interview today for a warehouse job, but I thought I was told on the phone they'd offer it to me if the interview went well, and then all they said was ""we'll be in touch, check your email."" The interviewer's body language also was also seemingly not interested, which gives me a bad outlook. I don't technically know yet, but I don't have any hopes it'll work out. I have bills to pay, I don't have a place to live, (I live with my cousin and aunt) and nobody around me understands that I literally cannot find a job. (My cousin thinks I must be doing something wrong in interviews or something, but he's a lawyer and hasn't had to find a job since he was in highschool, outside of his current one. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, but things just aren't working no matter what I do.) I don't know what to do. I have $10k in debt just from moving to and from the job I lost, and I have no way to pay it. I hate my life, I wish I had never moved, I wish I had a different education or just none at all. I ruined my life, I hate my life, and there is literally nothing I can do about it. My life hasn't improved at all over the past year, it's only getting worse and there's no end in sight. Forget getting back to my dream job, I can't even get hired doing nothing. Edit: Since so many asked, I got fired from a forensic scientist job. It was my fault, but I also feel like my leadership left me out to dry. My chances at getting another one are slim at this point because they don't want me to be a liability to them. I'm still trying, but I am also trying to find something lab based/adjacent, so that maybe I can prove that I can be trusted in a similar field. Edit 2: I don't bring up that I was fired in regular interviews unless directly asked. I am still applying for the forensic field in addition, in hopes my dreams aren't over, but I cannot lie there. Governments do extensive background checks and the worst thing you can be to them is a liar. Edit 3: Law enforcement related positions often require a polygraph exam after you provide background information about yourself, often times directly asking if you were ever fired. I know it's dumb, I don't control it. I, personally, am not a good enough liar to beat a polygraph exam. If it gets to that point, I have to disclose it. I am not really concerned with what they find in a database. I know this is Reddit and ""polygraphs bullshit"" and all that. You act like I have any say in the matter. I can refuse, but then I just will simply be dropped from contention. Edit 4 (Last edit:) For those who don't know or aren't reading, we literally had a routine ethics meeting (prior to me being fired,) where we discussed someone who got fired for lying on her application. She said she had taken a required class when she hadn't. She got an interview, disclosed she hadn't taken the class, but said she would. She was hired, took the class, then someone else found out and fired her because she misrepresented herself on her application. In this field of work, I cannot lie. As stated before, I don't volunteer the information, but I am not going to lie if I am directly asked because it can and very well might come back to bite me. It is worse to lie about it. For non-industry jobs, I haven't mentioned it at all and I will look into a different excuse for those places, if I am asked in the future. Thank you for all your replies, I can't get to everyone, but I have tried to share information where I can. I know I'll be ok in the end, it's just been really hard and I reached a bit of a breaking point yesterday.","My life is over, I wasted so much time in school for nothing ",0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ba5hue/my_life_is_over_i_wasted_so_much_time_in_school/,2024-03-09 01:30:58,Saturday,1,March,2024,True

Slowly lost all motivation for life and society as I gained some real life experience and saw the world for what it was. Most of my work experience is from my own doing - math tutoring, which I worked very hard at and even made a lot of my own material. I'm not doing any at the moment due to my MSc. Now I'm doing an AI MSc. There are over 200 people on my course. Lecturers, even my project supervisor, are too busy to meet. Every day I constantly see lay offs in tech. How AI is replacing jobs. How graduates can't get jobs. It's so obvious to me that we need UBI structures put in place now. Even if the starting amount was low. So many jobs are redundant, but people don't want to accept it. Even my lecturers are for the most part redundant, I just learn everything from online material. Yet, instead of accepting we need to change the structure of the economy, they come up with ways to force us to go to lectures, like capturing our attendance. So many jobs are ""nothing"" jobs. Shifting paper around to other people who shift paper around. Nothing is created. The physical jobs like nursing are the ones that have most value at the moment. Tech and STEM skills are becoming more and more automated by the day. Most people can't get meaningful jobs anymore. Yet we insist on trying to cling onto an economy that no longer exists. I'm currently sat here with a 50 word briefing of a project, which isn't related to the area I wanted my project in, and I have to write a project proposal report. 5 page document. I can't even get a hold of my project supervisor. Why? Because of greed. Universities taking hundreds of students just for money, not actually fulfilling their purpose which is preparing people for the job market. I have got good marks so far in this course, but I don't see the point in continuing and my motivation is non-existent. I don't know what I'd even do after graduating. I'm interested in automous machines/robots, computer vision, intelligent agents. Yet I couldn't even get a project in this area.

tofuborne,1bb4ook,Unemployment,0,2,"Been riding the jobless wave for a while, armed only with my camera, some freelancing gigs, and a knack for selling machines like I'm the next big thing in infomercials. It's been a wild ride, not gonna lie. But let's chat about something that's been buzzing in my brain: the changing work ethic among us young'uns. Now, don't get me wrong, it's not about being lazy. We're all about getting creative and making things happen, but the old 9-to-5 grind? Not so much. It's like everyone's waking up realizing there's more to life than the daily commute and water cooler gossip. And sure, the traditional advice for living off the grid says grow your own veggies, maybe rear some chickens. But here's the twist ‚Äì not everyone's cut out to be a farmer. What if I told you there's another way? Enter the world of home manufacturing ‚Äì yeah, I'm talking 3D printers, CNC machines, the works. We're crafting, we're creating, we're selling ‚Äì all from the comfort of our homes. It's a whole new ball game, folks. We're not just surviving; we're thriving, crafting our path, one printed part at a time. Who knew the road to self-sufficiency could look so... digital? So, what's your take? Are we witnessing the dawn of a new work revolution, or is everyone just dreaming in HD? And that's why I wanna spill the beans on an idea that evolved from a humble business venture to potentially something grander ‚Äì a movement, if you will. I'm talking about a renaissance of production right here in the USA. Imagine this: bringing jobs and opportunities back home for those who crave them, while offering a path of self-sustainability for the rest. By fostering a community where trading, selling, and buying parts isn't just transactional but a cornerstone of our economy, we could genuinely see a bloom in innovation and creativity. Now, I'll be the first to admit, this is a hefty dream, and I'm not decked out in rose-colored glasses thinking I'll revolutionize the world overnight. But hey, chasing dreams is what makes life spicy, right? Plus, I'm here selling [multi-axis customized, small-form, desktop-sized CNC machines]( ‚Äì affordable, too, if I may add, these are perfect for making parts for etsy sellers, or heck yet, resell the machines to the etsy sellers for double the prices with your own brand on it. This isn't just about profit; it's about laying the groundwork for a future where we all have a stake in creating and innovating. And yeah, when I tossed this idea into the r/CNC subreddit, let's just say it wasn't all thumbs up and high-fives. Got blasted harder than a sandblaster on a rusty fender. But guess what? I'm here, ready to take another round because what's progress without a little resistance, right? So, dear jobbers, fire away! Let's have it ‚Äì the good, the bad, and the brutally honest.

youburyitidigitup,1baxed9,Applications,0,3,"I read the post earlier about how this sub is a bad place to be when looking for a job. I thought it was right because we only have posts about unemployment, so I want to add a positive experience of finding jobs. I majored in anthropology because I wanted to be an archaeologist. To do so, you have to attend a Field School. Through your University, you travel somewhere, usually during summer, to work on an ongoing excavation and learn field techniques. However, Field Schools worldwide got cancelled for two summers in a row thanks to COVID. Like many other people in the field sciences, I had to take fewer classes per semester to elongate my undergrad so that I could attend a field school. It is impossible to get hired without one. I figured that I didn‚Äôt want to waste time, so I had to gain experience while waiting for lockdown to end. I volunteered at a local museum. They had just gotten a box of archaeological artifacts from a local dig, and they offered to let me catalog them. A few months after that, I applied to an internship at a larger museum. I was accepted because of my volunteering experience. Finally, when lockdown ended, I got to travel to Italy to excavate an Etruscan tomb and a medieval castle, which was one of the best experiences of my life. I came back, went back to my internship, and graduated six months later in December of 2022. My grades weren‚Äôt that good. I had a 2.9 GPA. Immediately, I started applying for work. I think I applied to 11 jobs and got one interview. The interviewer actually told me that my field school might not have prepared me for American archaeology, so my museum experience was crucial. Another factor is that, thanks to the field science bottleneck, I was the first generation of new applicant after COVID. She hired me, I moved to a new city, and started my current job. I make $17 an hour with benefits, so not much, but it‚Äôs enough to live comfortably. My one year review is coming up, and I expect to get a raise. I‚Äôve been getting back into my hobbies (ice skating and archery).

xiayueze,1bb3tw4,Career development,6,0,"The other night, I went out to dinner with a friend, and after I vented to him about a difficulty I faced at my new job, he introduced me to a new phrase I had never heard before: ‚ÄúReading the Air.‚Äù Although this phrase is new to me, the problem is not, and I wanted to get input of this phenomenon. ‚ÄúReading the Air‚Äù is a phenomenon that has always been a sore spot for me. I worked in corporate America for the last 8 years, and one problem I ran into multiple times with multiple different managers was that certain people simply refused to provide clear instructions on how to complete a task. It seems that there are some people who outright refuse to give clear, specific instructions on how to do something, as they prefer to have you attempt the task multiple times and then slowly reveal whether or not they like your deliverables using ambiguous language. Many of them have this air that they want you to read their minds instead of just telling the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of a task, and they are under the impression that building this interpersonal relationship where you ‚Äúfeel the other person out‚Äù is a valid way of working. Personally, I have no respect or empathy whatsoever for these people. I can‚Äôt read your mind. I speak three languages; ‚Äúthe air‚Äù is not one of them. If you want me to do something a certain way, then speak English and tell me what you want. What I am asking for is not hard, and it should not be hard for anybody. It seems to me like this is a symptom of extraordinarily poor communication skills, and I‚Äôm not really sure why anybody with communication skills this poor would expect me to respect their authority. One of the things my friend suggested over dinner was that they may not state what they want clearly because they themselves do not know exactly what they want. In that case, why should I be expected to trust that person‚Äôs vision for the project? After 8 years in corporate America, I decided to take a sabbatical. I quit my job, moved to a foreign country (Asia Pacific Region) and picked up a job teaching English to make ends meet - something I‚Äôve done before and I feel like I‚Äôm doing okay at so far. On Friday, my boss wanted me to film some marketing materials for the school, and I ran into this problem. He refused to provide a script for me to read, refused to provide notes on my performance, and refused to provide clear cut instructions about what he did and did not like about the performance. He kept giving extremely vague instructions, and just tried to show me examples of what another teacher (his favorite employee) had done and said ‚Äújust do something like this.‚Äù I told him he needed to be more specific than that. He outwardly grimaced, and said ‚Äúyou just need more practice and we just need to spend more time together so you can get to know me better.‚Äù No, I don‚Äôt. What I am asking for is not that hard. As I continued to push the issue, he continued to get visibly frustrated. The meeting did not end on a positive note. CONTEXT: 1) No, the language barrier is not part of the problem here. 2) My friend mentioned that this is common in Asia, at least in his experience, but the reason why I‚Äôm posting here is because this was a serious problem for me all throughout my time in corporate America (the problem here is not specific to one culture - it‚Äôs universal to a certain type of manager that thinks this is acceptable because of their own poor communication skills). While I am on sabbatical, I am trying to reflect on these challenges from my time in corporate and heal and grow so I can come back stronger.

I was stressed and the absence of proper management left me at a continued state of confusion to the point where I was frequently crying, having disturbed sleep and little stressors trigger my frustration and anger (makes me snarky/curt but I have never yelled or shouted profanities or insulted anyone). My supervisors managing me gets transferred out every few months and I keep having to rebuild relationships with new supervisors. And many new staff kept coming to me privately for help because no one knows anything, and I had the longest tenure rate (over 6 months) in the room.

No_Radio_5751,1baxcvu,Compensation,1,1,"Okay, so right now I make 87k after a midyear adjustment, after starting at 84k last year. However, last year we received a letter about our market value, which for me said I should be worth 96,662. This was when I was still making 84k. Essentially, I'm undervalued 15% below market value for my role. That means if I had started out at my true market value, I'd be making 100k right now. Another thing to note is that we're supposed to receive our raise this month retroactive to January, and this should be anywhere from 2.5-5% based on what I heard last year. So assuming I get the same adjustment as I did mid year last year, I'll be making 90k (although if I were at market value I'd be making nearly 104k). Needless to say this has been bumming me out but I recently found a role in my company with a range of 92-119k. It's a slightly different role, but close enough that I feel I could negotiate on the higher end given my experience and market value.

It is used in a very regulated and controlled environment. My boss left in November to start his own software company. He told me to cool my jets, you will be joining me at some point. Anyway I got this new guy (Indian) in November since he left. I have been the in-charge since my boss left. In January this guy sends me an email about outsourcing this system to an Indian company. I told him that it cant be done. We already use them for tier 1 support and they can barely do it. They can barely add users without screwing it up. Than about 4 weeks ago he schedules a call with me and a bunch of other people to talk about this application and handing it off to this Indian company AGAIN. I put together a deck explaining what it does in simple language and I went to the end users who gave me feedback about handing this off to this Indian company. They were vehemently opposed to doing this - I just put their feedback in the deck. Nothing about my opinion, just their own words. The manager was pissed beyond belief. I could see it at the meeting, it was all over his face. I got word a few days later from another guy that this guy was livid that I spoke to the end users without speaking to him first. How I embarrassed him that he did not know they end users hated this company. Keep in mind that for 3 months this guy has barely spoken to me. Than about a week ago with no warning they laid me off. I was not the only one - there were about 100 people. They told me at the notification that my job was eliminated. Than I found out they gave my job to this other Indian guy job who has no experience in this. He is also about 15 years younger than me.

I attended the same university where my mother is employed (thanks tuition remission)- and when I named the university, the interviewer (50sF) goes ‚Äúoh that makes sense because of your mom.‚Äù I asked what they meant and they said something about her working there, so of course I studied there. It was so uncomfortable and bizarre that I just asked if they were sure they found my mom, and they proceeded to say her full name, list her department and other personal details unrelated to her work. I was so shocked that I just I didn‚Äôt know how to shut down the topic or leave the interview so I just laughed uncomfortably, and the interviewer went on to say that my mother seemed like a fun person and that she would love to hang out with her. I jokingly offered to call my mom and they finally pivoted towards the job, although less to interview me, and more to offer further violations of privacy against current employees, clients, and industry partners (Including anecdotal admission to wage theft, and telling me they were going to illegally fire people). I have never had the same last name as my mother, and have my own socials pretty locked down. I have no idea how they connected us through the university, as I wasn‚Äôt even in her program.

I said absolutely and set up a time that week. The interview for that position was so much better! Conversation flowed well, the interview panel seemed interested in me, and I was able to really highlight my experience and skills with the interview team. I was excited to learn about the job position, and felt it was right up my alley.

Seemed low, but it's an interesting company and it seemed more like a manager level so I thought it was just ""senior"" in title only. I told them I would be at the top end/slightly above that, depending on the full scope of the role. They agreed, but after 2 interviews with hiring manager and team, the scope of the role is definitely on the senior end. Benchmarking other similar positions, I'm seeing a salary range around 140-180. I think they're going to make an offer, but I don't want to screw myself. What's acceptable for negotiation given their range is now so far apart what I'd expect? This is more of a random one, but curious to see if anyone else has done this.

boo_ella,1baamga,Leaving a job,19,1,"Well, if you've read my other posts on here you'll see I've been debating whether or not to give my two week notice because my mental health can no longer handle working full time. I'm close to being fired at my current job because if I get 7 points (I'm at 6 points currently, points occur when you call out) you get a written warning. I was told because I had an OCA reportable incident that I didn't report right away, I got a written warning already so I was told if I hit 7 points it is a final written warning. As the title suggests, my parents have offered to pay me to clean their house ($20 per hour (they have a large mansion type home and I'm mainly going to be cleaning my sister's ""half of the house"" because my mom normally has maids clean up there) but it won't be as long hours and they live a little further than my current job) my husband has been trying to convince me to stay at my current job but I don't think I can get my accomodation to work part time (I've been told the third-party company my job uses looses their paperwork all the time) and even if I could, the main head-honco at our company has told me ""this may not be the best job for you"" type deal. If I give my two week notice on Wednesday (the 13th), would my final working day be the 27th? I'd like to keep working until after the 22ed as there's a bonus coming up. I don't know what else I can do at this point in time... My husband has even texted me today saying that I've proven to be unreliable which is true but doesn't help me feel better at all. I don't believe in therapy because I've had around 8 therapists in my life and only one really even helped a little (I've also found out the only psychiatrist that takes our insurance that's excepting new patients charges over $100 with insurance if you haven't met your deductible (we haven't yet) and that's more than I'm comfortable paying) and I'm thinking even if I just work for my parents it should be enough work for me to stay not depressed. My dad does seem concerned with the amount of money my mom is willing to pay but frankly my sister is not good at keeping her side of the house clean or teaching her kids how to do chores so I get to clean if I end up working over there. It is bad (the toilet looks black, there's constantly stuff on the floor such as cereal, food, toys, etc. and generally her side is just messy) and I know it will be a draining job but I guess setting my own hours and being able to visit my family might be worth it.

What upsets me is that I apologized to my employer over text, told her I wanted to talk to her in person, and assured her that it wouldn't happen again, but she responded that she had no interest in talking to me about it. She also said vaguely ""this has happened one too many times"" when in reality this was the first time this had happened (me falling asleep on the job). The only way I could maybe guess at what she meant by this statement was that one other time I had come in to work and discovered afterward that I was not feeling mentally well enough to work, and I told her I needed the night off. I worked at all of my other shifts over a four-month period diligently -- did not procrastinate on the job, showed up on time and worked hard with the exception of taking necessary short breaks. Also, I was never given a regular schedule, leaving me having to text my employer each week to find out when she wanted me to work, and several times she did not even respond to my texts. I even showed up several times after having gotten no response and was told that I wasn't needed that day after I had already shown up, which was incredibly frustrating to say the least. And there were no scheduled breaks for employees despite working 6 hours + in a busy kitchen.

reapandsowchi0,1b9quo6,Leaving a job,4,3,"Hi all, sorry this is a long post. I don't know if it's right to ask freelance-related questions here. I could use some advice, as I'm stressed and overwhelmed. I'll first give a background and then share my current situation. **Background:** About 8 months ago, I started working as a full-time employee for a small company in the US. Unfortunately, I had to resign just before Christmas due to a family emergency (I returned to my home country in Asia, thus ending my US visa). From the get-go, I noticed the working environment was toxic - micromanagement, abuses, and unrealistic expectations. Despite this, I stayed because I needed the money, and the US job market was brutal. Days were highly stressful, with management sometimes shockingly rude. When I resigned before Christmas, I was offered to continue working remotely as a freelancer because they liked my work. Despite not enjoying the environment, I agreed to the proposal and began working as a remote freelancer in early 2024 (from my home country). Being new to freelancing, I read many articles on best practices and procedures for contractors and freelancers. My initial request was for a written agreement. I even drafted one and provided it to the CEO and HR for signing three months ago. Despite my requests, I haven‚Äôt received a written agreement for this freelance work, though I‚Äôve been invoicing them weekly. I know this is my fault, and I feel like an idiot for not having a written contract for freelancing. I've been consistently reminding them about it, but despite my efforts, none of us have signed a written agreement. As I had been receiving regular payments for my freelance work, I didn't feel a sense of urgency in finalizing the written agreement. Looking back, I realize it was not wise to think this way. **Current Situation:** Working remotely for 3 months now, and things have only gotten worse. Projects lack direction, deadlines are unrealistic, and there‚Äôs a blame-game culture among colleagues. I've been unfairly criticized in meetings, and even the CEO‚Äôs daily meetings include personal attacks and expletive curse words. At this point, it's starting to affect my health. I hope you guys can advise me on these questions: - Is it legal for me to resign from this freelance gig immediately without notice? - Hypothetically, even if there‚Äôs a signed agreement, can I still resign immediately, and would an email suffice as written notice? - As I wrote before, I drafted a written agreement and sent it to them for signature, but it remains unsigned. I used standard terms from a template, and I included this under the termination clause: ""Both parties may terminate this agreement at any time, for any reason, by providing written notice to the other party."" - Additionally, there's an NDA in my written agreement, stipulating that the work I do belongs to the client. I retained this NDA from my full-time offer when I started in the US. I've been considering quitting this job every single day, but I've hesitated for the following main reasons: - If I quit without a written agreement, how do I list this freelance job on my resume or verify it for future employers without a written agreement? - I‚Äôve also planned to apply for work visas in other foreign countries, where the government requires proof of past employments. I don't know how to verify this freelance work without an agreement. Once I leave, I'm certain nobody in the company will verify my employment. - I've kept records of all the invoices I've issued to the company, along with emails from my bank showing the receipt of international payments. However, I'm unsure if these documents are sufficient proof for potential employers. My main concern here is the lack of written agreement, which could impact my future employment opportunities. Since I'm not in the US, I'm not concerned about filing for unemployment. - Could there be legal consequences for quitting without notice, such as getting sued by the CEO for any possible reason? Sorry again for these dumb questions.

I work a government job but we are contractors, not government employees. It's administrative work and it isn't hard to do. It interests me a great deal because I enjoy the industry the work falls in, and it's a beautiful location, and I'm just overall a great fan. Anyway. I put a lot of effort and pride in the work I do for this job. My coworker, on the other hand, does not. We started the same day. Learned the same things on the same dates, had the same amount of training, etc. She comes in at least 30 minutes late on a daily basis, but usually closer to 1-2 hours. She then sits in her cubicle on her phone, spends another hour doing her hair and makeup, then goes to the bathroom for 20-35 minutes. Comes back, signs on for about 30 minutes. Then lets her screen go blank and sits there on her phone. Every restroom break is at least 20 minutes. (I go for 7 and feel like it was ages) On top of that, she will go for 30 minutes before lunch and say 'I'm going to the restroom before lunch.' be gone for that long and come back, have the audacity to say she's going to lunch. Then takes a 1.5 hour lunch! On top of being an hour late. OMG. We do reports, are contact points for several firms, I have 7 to handle and she has 6. We do weekly and monthly reports. Each month I complete my reports and get them back from my firms while she struggles to even get them started. I feel a lot of stress about this because I like this person apart from work. She is sweet and relatable. And so kind. But her work ethic drives me INSANE. And I can't stop letting it. Her work is separate from mine, but her firms' contact points come to me for assistance, especially if it's urgent, because my coworker will say she is going to do something, something that would take me no more than 30 minutes to complete, and then a week later we get a follow up email requesting it be done, *again,* because she hasn't done it. I feel weird because we do the same exact thing, but for different companies. When we started I felt like I had more drive and initiative to get things done in a timely manner, I started to do everything and didn't give her a chance.

OddSocksRule,1b9wdug,Leaving a job,0,1,"My current situation: I'm a student, I do volunteering, I've been working at the same job for 3 years and I try help manage things at home with my family too. I'm debating quitting my job and I'm giving myself a month to decide. Why I'm thinking of leaving my job: I feel like a screw up. I got promoted and now depending on the rota I run the shift or join my team in doing basic duties. When I do basic duties I'm told I'm too slow. When I run the shift and purely focus on getting everything done on time I'm told I don't care enough about working as a team with the other departments. When I do the extra tasks I'm given and/or anticipate other departments needs despite risking going overtime, I'm told I care too much. Why I want to stay: It's not my job to fire myself for doing a bad job, if I was that bad I wouldn't have been promoted and still have the position after 9 months, if I quit I'll never hear the end of it from my parents, I really like the team, I have good relationships there, I love the routine and student flexibility offered by the job, there's no other weekend jobs available right now and I kinda need the money, I'm in a sort of managment position right now and having it for longer would do my CV good, I like the stability of this job because while I'm studying, training, handling volatile situations at home, this job is constant. I understand that the regional manager is on all of my managers asses right now so they are all just stressed. It feels like there's a communication barrier over how I'm meant to improve because I'm autistic and communicate differently to my managers. If I do decide to stay I need to sit down with my line manager and figure out why they think I'm slow and figure out how they want me to balance being on time and doing extra tasks.

I never did the smart thing either and learned a trade or got a degree so I always did unskilled labor type stuff. I did a lot of random work for temp agencies and bounced around various entry level jobs over the years. I always had trouble fitting in anywhere long term. Being deaf comes with it's own unique issues. Especially because I can speak fairly well and carry on a conversation in a 1on1 or a quiet, small group setting. It kind of becomes a ""invisible disability"". I want to rejoin the workforce now that my children are old enough to be left alone for a little while if necessary but it's been so long that I'm kinda psyching myself out a little.

I told him I agree I have been been underperforming and I apologised for allowing it to affect me so much that my manager had noticed and felt he needed to talk to me about it. I talked about how badly I have been sleeping, how unmotivated I am outside of work to clean or be sociable. I told him I am working on getting it together and I will be contacting the doctors to see if they can help. And I talked about feeling burnt out and feeling really tired all the time due to the lack of sleep. I apologised for turning up later than usual and explained it's so I feel more energised but it's unnacceptable. I also said I am isolating myself at home and dont go out (havent been outside unless its for work in a long time). I apologised again and said I will be working on it and he said I have a lot of potential but I need to help myself to get it out of me (paraphrasing).

I need to try more, and thats on me for slacking on myself. Even though I said its not a formal meeting, I really feel like shit and feel really anxious. I have felt shit since and feel like my life is crumbling lol. I even promised myself I wont smoke weed or drink anything until I fix it. not to say thats effecting me, like I said this has been a constant issue and I always have these issues with life even when I was sober.

They asked me things like if I was happy in my role recently and what I did was fulfilling immediately after the departure of our manager. They then asked me to start filling out this report that was clearly for being used against me. I documented everything in an email. They of course asked to meet offline. I took notes of everything they said and informed them I was taking notes. I then followed up promptly after documenting everything we talked about. No response. It‚Äôs been a few days and they still haven‚Äôt responded to my email thread I‚Äôve been documenting or followed up on my report.

gismo8888,1b99l7m,Discipline,4,5,"I am coming up on 6 years of working at a small but locally beloved dessert company which I didn‚Äôt start but gradually helped grow in quality and popularity as my role with the business grew. The business changed ownership a few months ago, which provided me a raise but much more work/responsibility which I was ready for. The new owner said all the right things in early interactions which lead me to believe he could fix the issues from previous ownership to help get the business to the next level. Since the change occurred I had to renegotiate my pay and salary status to a lower hourly wage. The owner was disrespectful of my time and overworked me to a degree which in my opinion was unnecessary due to the seasonal nature of the business. They also did not respect any of my experience and in almost every instance disagreed with my input. I was previously in charge of recipe development which has completely been taken over by the new owner and resulted in sub par offerings that would not have met previous standards. After a month or so of butting heads on the direction of the business/menu/schedule etc. my full time schedule was abruptly cut from 44+ hours a week to zero the night before a new work week. The previously overbearing owner was suddenly very quiet and for nearly 3 weeks has given me no clarity on whether I will work there again despite my active employment status. I am trying to move on but I gave so much of myself to this business and made connections and recipes that the new owner will be at least trying to continue and benefit from in my absence.

ExFoundMyOldAccount,1b9c987,Office relations,6,3,"I'm not sure what my aim at in posting this is, I guess it's just commiseration with anyone else facing something similar, I'd feel a lot better. My old boss was great; I could go to him with a problem and he'd try to, well, actually solve it instead of belittling me and just reassigning me to move furniture. He quit for his mental health as, AFAIK, a certain Mr. Very Important just didn't like him and demanded his peons f--- with him repeatedly. This new guy, not only is he a hoarder (I can't WAIT for the fire chief to come this July) but if he sees you -- literally, you come within his view, you are questioned as to what you are doing and have to give a full account of 1. why you are here 2. why you WERE here any time in the past 4 hours and what you were doing THEN, and 3. there's a 50/50 chance he'll disbelieve you and reassign you anyway. He doesn't SAY you're lying, he just says ""well, we need you to move this furniture"" even if you left all of your things on the other side of the gigantic workplace and need to put them away. So I feel like I'm playing Assassin's Creed or something, it's so silly. Example from the other day: He had JUST assigned me in person to work on work tickets, had JUST added a ticket for replacing lightbulbs not 40 minutes prior, something way below my skillset but that's a whole 'nother conversation, and I told him I was going to tackle it. And lo and behold, I have to walk down past his office to something called the lightbulb room, as his office door faces an important artery in the building, whilst I'm carrying an F32T8 (very large obvious light bulb) to make sure I was retrieving the right replacement. My coworker and I both actively avoid this T juncture by walking outside, way out of our way. He KNOWS this. He must, as we just disappear and never use it because of his interrogations. But I was thinking, no way, he just affirmed my assignment, surely it won't happen. But I get stopped. He says, like he always does, ""\[Naaame\], sooo... what're we working on today???"" in a tone, prior to meeting him, I assumed was reserved for very young, mentally challenged toddlers, those coming out of anesthesia, or lobotomy patients. It's like everyone has to do this song and dance to make sure he knows HE's in charge, HE's so smart, and it's infuriating. I am so close to asking him what country he's the king of because he's been sitting on his ass for the last 6 hours while I've been, say, elbow deep in feces helping to mount toilets, so it must be a royal pronoun. I am the only female in my department but he does it to everyone, although particularly, it seems, me -- though I'm a ""weirdo"" who, unlike everyone else, likes to use my telescope and stargaze, play tabletop games and bike ride instead of getting wasted after work. The only way I can get him to stop is to somehow bring up gender. He is terrified of Title IX. But that's it. Everybody keeps telling me to go to HR, but my coworker did (what specifically, I am not sure, he was so mad he couldn't talk), and they dug up a minor, informal complaint made months prior to get him fired: it made stuff worse for him. Everything is such a small slight, I can't properly convey it in a notarized document. How do you **prove** someone has a tone that is just dripping with condescension? We're a single-party state, but I cannot imagine secret recordings I've hidden away for months would be appropriate and wouldn't result in some major reprimand. **I guess I'm asking, how unusual is a situation where you work in an environment that is so fake to appease the higher-ups' egoes that it, at times, approaches Poe's law in its levels of ridiculousness? How the f--- can someone not only be aware that coworkers actively cringe at his sight and are constantly avoiding him, but seemingly revel in it instead of, I dunno, taking a huge step back and reevaluating his life decisions?** I can't get a new job, long story. The HR guy, I cannot tell you how many times I walk in and can hear them joking around with eachother, so they're best buds. But as soon as one of us, ""the help"" enters the room, it's like a sterile cockpit, where not even the funniest of (non-vulgar) jokes will even get a polite smile? Just an expectant, ""Why-aren't-you-talking-about-work"" angry gaze? But I personally confirmed half these ""important"" peoples' jobs wouldn't even exist if it weren't for a certain Mr. Very Important accommodating one of the good ol' boys after surgery, etc. Like, their title didn't exist, description is repetitive, convoluted, nonsensical and/or is a duplicate and falls under the jurisdiction of multiple already-filled positions, wayback machine shows it not even being publicly posted before position is miraculously filled, coincidentally by his son-in-law, etc. He holds multiple positions, at least one within: law enforcement, local government, AND my company, a major area employer.

Hungry_Ad5456,1b9o67x,Article,24,0,"the question of having an 81-year-old president in the context of prevailing ageism in America is a nuanced and debated topic. It raises important considerations regarding leadership, experience, and societal perceptions. On one hand, age can bring a wealth of experience and wisdom. An 81-year-old president likely has a long history of navigating various challenges, which can contribute to effective decision-making and leadership. This experience may be especially valuable in addressing complex issues that require a deep understanding of historical context and nuanced perspectives. However, the concern about ageism is valid. In a society where ageism exists, there may be preconceived notions about older individuals' capabilities, adaptability, and understanding of contemporary issues. Ageism can potentially hinder the public's trust in a leader, creating skepticism about their ability to relate to and address the concerns of a diverse and rapidly changing society. It's essential to evaluate candidates based on their individual qualities, health, and adaptability rather than making blanket assumptions based on age alone. Leadership should be about competence, vision, and the ability to connect with and represent the interests of the people. In conclusion, while age can bring valuable experience, addressing ageism in the context of selecting a president requires a balanced approach. It's crucial to assess candidates holistically, considering their individual qualities and capabilities rather than making sweeping judgments based solely on age. The goal should be to foster a society that values diverse perspectives and recognizes the potential contributions of leaders of all ages.",What's your thought when it comes to having an 81-year-old president while ageism is running wild in America?,0.39,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1b9o67x/whats_your_thought_when_it_comes_to_having_an/,2024-03-08 13:40:38,Friday,13,March,2024,False

Get to the job I go through orientation which was two long grueling days and then I finally get to my job in which I was lost on what to do the manager never came and talked to me so I had to go to the lead and ask what I should do and if I could shadow her in which she said ""I don't like people sitting over the top of me"" so I was like oh okay she taught me the basics and then after that I got 3 days of maybe a hour of training each and after that nothing, no training, no one came to talk to me, no one seemed to want me there anytime I asked questions I was made out to be an idiot.

Confident-Night-2068,1b8trcj,Career development,10,17,"As the title says. Lately, I've decided to upgrade my resume to include my administrative experience for a small family company I work for. I figured, that with a few months of experience, I'd surely get accepted into an administrative position, and so I did. The interview went well, but I left feeling anxious and defeated for some reason. I landed exactly what I needed, a 9-5 administrative position with good benefits, yet the interview felt weird and I still feel unsatisfied. With each new job, I start to lose hope, I really do. At my first few jobs I had a super good mindset, basically a ""new job, new opportunities"" kind of thing. Now, I'm feeling cynical. As almost every single job I had, I only expect toxic coworkers to be present, high workloads, and unappreciative bosses, and I'm not a slacker! The interview? Guy was unkept (unprofessional attire + long dirty fingernails), kept telling me to ""chill, you don't need to be nervous"" (I wasn't even nervous), kept looking at his phone when I said something, and lied about the fact that it is mandatory to work a night-shift week every six weeks. I got this job through an agency, and they didn't disclose this on their job post. When I called this out, they didn't know about this at all and told me they'll contact the employer (waiting on what they have to say), so it seems like the interviewer straight up lied because they need more people. My thoughts: ""Great... I thought I'll be able to get a nice job, but yet again, there's a bunch of clear signs that this won't be that good."" I had a job as a delivery driver which I really enjoyed, and they told me that I could come back. I had a disagreement with my supervisor and he even apologized and begged me to stay. Now my ego is holding me back from doing it, as I left because of unlawful behavior on their part (to which they admitted and apologised for it). I left because it simply didn't match my principles. I got treated unlawfully after doing so much for them (overtime, taking difficult routes/tasks without hesitation, traveling to other cities because of lack of manpower in other facilities, almost never taking sick leave and off days). I also have my own company, which is earning almost nothing. My main goal in life is to grow as a music producer (my business) just to leave this stupid career bullshit behind. But for now, I do need something to make a living. It's just so damn difficult to find something good without a proper degree. It's like all uneducated jobs are full of toxicity. What can I do to feel good at work? I already checked the boxes of being a good employee, taking care of myself and my sleep and eating habits so that I can work optimally, yet still it's not enough to feel satisfied. I'm a totally different person when at work and I hate it. What I do know is that I either love driving, doing administrative tasks like data input (I love monotonous tasks, don't ask). The work itself is usually not the problem, I worked in a deep-cleaning company where we scrubbed toilets in mental facilities. All I thought was ""if that's what I need to do to grow my business, then that's what I'll do."" Later on I left because I kept getting bullied by some older guy taunting me about how I'm young and that I'll quit in two weeks, so I quit. It's not that I let people live rent free in my head, or that I'm being a softy. It's just that I am so disappointed with how the job market operates and how many miserable people actually are present in workplaces, which is actually logical since 99% of people need to work in order to live, so of course you'll come across assholes. Maybe I am actually being a softy and I should man up and not take anything personal, but my emotions have still led me to write this post and plea for help. If anybody was in a similar situation or has good tips, I'll be glad to hear it. Tl;dr: Basically i lost hope for any new job opportunity because of past experiences, and I don't know what to do with that.","I'm no longer positive about any job I get into, I'm so stuck!",0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1b8trcj/im_no_longer_positive_about_any_job_i_get_into_im/,2024-03-07 12:44:29,Thursday,12,March,2024,False

Before I tell the details I want to mention that right now in the country that I live in it is nearly impossible to find a job even if you have a great degree from a respectable university and it is also nearly impossible to find an internship program due to high amount of new graduates and low amount of job opportunities. Long story short I will be graduating from university in June and I have no experience in the area that I want to work. I have the academic knowledge but my work experience is way off since none of the internships that I have completed are related to marketing field which is the area that I want to work in. Right now I am trying to find an internship program that I can work in marketing area however no one is willing to hire me as an intern since I'm about to graduate. I have two options after I graduate A) I will be searching for a job in the marketing area until I find one or B) there is this one company that is willing to hire me right after I graduate but the job is not related to my field at all and people who work for this company work for at least 20 years so your whole life goes to this company ( for context it is a highly reliable company and they pay you well as well asin a timely manner so people stay for the long run) So my question is this: what is my deadline to find a job after I graduate? Because when there is a huge space in your CV I know that usually companies somehow find a way to not hire you relating their reason to that gap in your CV ( they say things like you have been far away from work life Etc.) I feel like my deadline to find a job is August if I don't find an internship until I graduate because my previous work experience ended in last year may so already there is this huge gap in my CV.

I'm still lucky compared to many people - eg I didn't earn being alive ahead of people born in warzones or with fatal diseases and I didn't earn my intelligence), whereas other people have to work for years to reach the same position. If those people who lucked into it were doing a good job once they got there I'd still be a little annoyed with my situation, but I'd be much more ok with it. But there's a couple jobs I've had where I've struggled hard to get the job, am being paid less than the others and even commuting further than them (due to not finding a job in my own city) - but I get to the workplace and half of the staff are lazy bums who do the bare minimum or people who spend all their day moaning complaining about their job, complaining about the manager or gossiping about colleagues. It's like being in high school. Yet somehow Human Resources let these people into the job, even though they clearly don't have the attitude and work ethic requested in the job description or person specification. Obviously the solution for an individual is to never give up and to learn how to game the recruitment system better, but it's clearly a broken system. Then you deal with family and wider society assuming you're lazy, unambitious or a bad worker for not having a better job or more money. Applying for jobs is an effort, but it's fine - the feeling of having my character and worthiness as a person unfairly attacked is when it starts to wear me down. Not sure if this breaks the rules. I don't have anywhere IRL to divulge this to. And sorry if you're one of the employees I'm talking about...I'm sure you have your own reasons.","It can be frustrating trying so hard to get a job, then getting it and seeing ineffectual or uninterested employees who clearly act in a way that doesn't meet the person specification/job description, but they somehow got the job",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1b8txnw/it_can_be_frustrating_trying_so_hard_to_get_a_job/,2024-03-07 12:53:36,Thursday,12,March,2024,False

lilac2481,1b95r40,Job searching,0,1,"This is long, so bear with me. I used to work part-time at a real estate office from March 2017-July 2018 as a receptionist. When I started, I thought it wasn't so bad. I liked my coworkers and the agents were awesome to work with. As time went on, I noticed toxicity, drama, and bullshit with upper management. 2 of them caused 99% of the stress that we felt. It was a completely toxic environment. My 2 coworkers who were fellow receptionists also felt the tension. Every time Friday rolled around, I dreaded it because I worked weekends. Whenever I would go in, I would get the urge to walk out and go home. I remember one time I asked for Sunday off because of Orthodox Easter. I went to the restroom and when I came out, they were both outside screaming at each other. In June 2018, I found resumes for my position and I knew then and there they were planning to fire me. Luckily I found my full-time job that I'm at now a few weeks later. I left July 2018, but I still worked the weekends because the person who was supposed to replace me never showed. Luckily, someone called and said they sent their resume. I let my boss know and they hired her. By that time I was already at my new job and absolutely burnt out waiting for a new hire to start so I can train them. Since I left, I would hear that when new people would start, they didn't last very long. Also, soon after I left, one of the upper management left to work at our sister office in another location and the other who worked in management became the team leader. I still keep in touch with some agents, and 2 of them invite me to a client BBQ that they host every year. Fast forward to 2020 when people were starting to go back to the office, I was contacted and asked if I could help out on the weekends while they found a new receptionist. The new full-time receptionist was there and told me she was quitting because she couldnt take working there and it was affecting her health. I said ok and was there for a few weeks, but I had to stop because it was too much for me in addition to working full-time. They understood thankfully. Fast forward again to 2024, I get a text from my old coworker who is now an agent asking me if I would be willing to come back. My coworkers know that I've been looking for a higher paying job for a long time now. I've been on interviews, but no luck. The job pays in the low $40,000's which is not a lot. I told him I'll send over my resume, but I'm not promising anything. When they called me for an interview, I was not excited at all. I got a sinking feeling in my stomach. My coworkers told me that the former management who became team leader got fired, and hired a new one who is much nicer and it's not a toxic environment anymore....but I still have my doubts. I have an interview on Tuesday. I'm going to ask of they offer any benefits such as health insurance. If they don't, I'm not accepting the job. For membere who are outside the US, our health insurance is offered through our jobs. This job is closer to my house. My commute home currently is almost 2 hours. I told my parents about this opportunity. My dad says it's not worth it because of the salary, and to stay where I am until something better comes along. My mom says to go for it and to stop thinking about the past and making it negative. I don't know about this. I'm applying to other companies that pay more, but it is hard trying to find something.
