Overall, this was a role that I had enjoyed, despite having to commute a total of 3 hours each day.\\n\\nTwo years ago, my daughter required surgery and the following day I fell and broke my arm.  I was late for an important meeting the next day.  I was issued a written warning and placed on a probationary period.  That should have been enough of a warning to me, but I put it behind me.\\n\\nFast forward to a Thursday night a few months ago.  My wife suffered a major heart attack.  I took her to the hospital, where she was placed in a medically induced coma, connected to a ventilator and had a pump inserted into a major artery to help relieve the workload on her heart, and had an angioplasty performed with 2 stents inserted.  I called my boss that night and told him what was happening and I would not be back in to work for the foreseeable future. I sent our entire group an update on Sunday.  Her condition was still critical and she was still comatose in the icu.  She remained that way in the ICU for a solid week.\\n\\nI emailed them again later that week with another update.  After the 8th day of missed work (sick and vacation days were used), my boss calls me and tells me that we need to have a meeting with HR that afternoon.  I was placed on another probationary period and written up yet again.  He told me that there comes a time where I just have to decide what is more important, my job or my wife.  I was to come back in the office, 5 days per week or I would be fired.\\n\\nThe HR lady suggested that I take FMLA leave, which I did.  I have heard that the manager talks about how projects will move forward once I am back in the office.  I intend to use every last PTO day I have left, then I will return my development laptop and quit.\\n\\nIn the interim, I was contacted by a recruiting agent that told me of a job opportunity only minutes away from where I live.

And it's talking about things I'm responsible for. Specifically, it was about delays in the processing of certain invoices and how it's severely hurting cash flow. He goes on and on with words like \\\"unacceptable\\\" and \\\"ridiculous\\\" and how serious discussions need to be had about responsible parties. I get to the bottom...\\n\\nThere I see an email screenshot with my name circled in red to make it clear that this email was a targeted call-out. I was stunned and I still am. The freaking *CFO* just bypassed at least two links in the chain of command to personally put me, one of the lowest level employees in the company, on blast in front of every person I ever have or ever will interact with.

I told my boss I have plans and he asked what I was doing. I responded that I was hanging with my friends. He proceeded and asked me to cancel my plan. He questioned me why couldn't I cover when I have no kids. I told him that I did not like canceling plans, and he told me that I was not being a team player. I straight up told him that I couldn't cancel my plans, so I didn't cover for her. Her night was uncovered. Anyway, since Friday and Monday, my boss hasn't talked to me.

Additionally, many of you have commented on it\\u2019s how I say things I believe that to be true as well. I want to pay close attention to my tone and body language.

I'm articulate, but I'm not charismatic at all.\\n\\n**My goals:** My only goal in life is to have a family. Don't even have a girlfriend (don't even know if there are any single women near my age in town lol), so I've got a ways to go. I want to be able to support them and give them a good life. I have no particular desire to make 6 figures or make it big. I just want decent income and a job that's either secure or in demand so I don't have to stress too much about everything falling out from underneath us (I understand, starting this late in life, I may not have this luxury, but it's still my desire).\\n\\n**My ideas**: I've considered Web Development (self taught from home, following The Odin Project, which I'm already a fair ways into), trying to find a way to go to college to become a Dental Hygienist (the nearest college for me would be 1 hour 40 mins away, and I think there'd be lots of pre reqs which means it might be a 5 year process for me, but honestly I don't know how colleges work and I doubt that career is worth that much money/time), or just getting a job and spamming applications constantly at better places to try to work my way into a good job (e.g. starting at Walmart and trying to get into Costco, both of which are an hour away from me lol).\\n\\nAnyways, rambling post, sorry. I really, really need help and no one in my family can help me with plans for the future, so I'm hoping one of you can help someone who is completely lost.

I bet most of you can agree this is a very stupid decision. The plan was for my parents to sell our house for around 150,000 USD and then use that money to purchase a high-end RV or trailer and get a truck to move said trailer.\\n\\nThis definitely wouldn't be enough money at all and I told them this, but they continued to deny this. I also had all A's at my public school, and I was continuing to join around 3 or 4 clubs and gather more promising electives like Speech and Debate and Weight Training to put those on a college resume and either get a job for music, photography, or film. I was starting to plan out my life more and more, but because of this decision to move with an RV everything was falling apart for me, I didn't know what to do, as every time I brought this up to them they would scream at me or tell me I'm brainwashed by my school. A giant reason for them taking my siblings out of public school and eventually me is because the school had students wear masks for a month due to the government's COVID-19 regulation.\\n\\nThis was only for a month so I had no problem, and I went on through my school year like normal, expecting to come back next year, yet they had ripped my accounts out of the school system and my parents instead signed me up for an education course on Khan Academy. No textbook supplements, no tutoring, no online OR in-person teaching. Just them handing me this website and telling me \\\"Do what you were going to do last year. \\\"I am enraged, and I've tried to make the best of this as my school will not take me back until maybe next year, and even then I'll be held back. I am known as a \\\"gifted kid\\\" so what they have done is set my motivation, progress, and everything back a lot. I've expressed this and have been met with internet restrictions, being told I'm brainwashed and a follower, had my phone taken away and messages searched through, and been forced to do and say things to people I love outside of my family without my control. Anyways, back to the main point, I just don't know what to do anymore. Right now my dad has me working on an essay on Mao Zedong (has no relevance to the history I am learning or my English at all, simply based on what HE finds interesting), and working on Khan Academy Geometry and Physics. (I have barely learned up to Congruence and haven't even done gravitational equations for physics)\\n\\nI'm fearful I might have to go to an alternative school or be held back a grade, which would look awful on a college resume and might screw up my motivation to go to college altogether.\\n\\nI'm just asking if anyone here has had a similar situation, if this is not the right place I apologize, but I am in need of urgent help on how to get myself out of this and find a good career path. Thank you. :)\\n\\nEdit: I am ecstatic, thank you all for the support and comments and holy shit I've never gotten this many comments or anything. I'm gonna try a lot of these and maybe I can get out of these hellhole. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH AGAIN!!! :D  \\n\\n\\n Edit 2: Hey everyone! (thanks for the platinum and ALL OF THE AWESOME COMMENTS!) I'd like to say me and my girlfriend have read most of the comments here and have come up with a sort-of plan (in the works currently) but yeah  \\n To ease your minds, here it is:   \\n I'm going to continue through this, ignoring my parents' schooling and work towards studying the ACT/SAT, improving the knowledge I need to get a GED, which after I turn 18 I will get my GED, then go into Community College, and then State College   \\n My girlfriend is a year older than I, so once she graduates high school and is 18, she will have her license and enough money for a studio apartment. I'm going to get one or two jobs through programs like Goodwill Connects and maybe just earning money on the side (I have a few ways to do this.)  \\n With these jobs we can split the rent of the studio apartment and then we can try to get me emancipated at 17, and then I can move on with my life and continue as planned! :)\"", "title": "I'm 16, my parents took me out of public school because of masking, what should I do to further my education?", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/12tcwhx/im_16_my_parents_took_me_out_of_public_school/"}, {"author": "LeaveElectrical8766", "created_utc": 1689728944.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 938, "post_id": "153gctt", "score": 1682, "subreddit": "careerguidance", "text": "\"TLDR: CEO gave me a minor talking to for NOT bringing homemade cookies when I visited the southern office.\\n\\nSo I'm in IT but I enjoy baking for fun and friends. So for holiday parties or just because I felt like it I'd randomly bring in my Great grandma's chocolate chip cookies (that I made but her recipe.) Not often, only a couple times a year, 5 on the extreme end.\\n\\nEveryone LOVES them even people who claim to not like cookies normally.  \\n\\nRandomly my job sends me to the southern office and I'd randomly bring them cookies as well when I got there. Well apparently I didn't do it the last two trips and someone in the southern office felt this warrented a complaint to the CEO since this hurt their feeling!  Now granted this is a sub 50 person company and the CEO has an open door policy. But comeon really?  \\n\\nSo the CEO tells me that people complained last time that I was down there that I didn't bring them cookies and I needed to make it right next trip.  WHAT THE BLAZES! \\n\\nI can't be the only one who thinks this is crazy petty and disappointed both in my southern coworkers and in the CEO that he didn't tell them to just be thankful when I do bring them.\\n\\nI'm not going to disobey the CEO, but you better bet that I'm going to be mixing and baking them on company time now. I was ordered to make them by the CEO so it's Buisness time now. \\n\\nThoughts on if this is crazy or not?\\n\\nEdit: For clarity it wasn't a write up or anything, but his tone was a cross between annoyance that he had to deal with this and wanting me to make it go away, and unbelief that he had to deal with this in the first place.  Not his joking/teasing tone. That tone is very distinctive.\\n\\nEdit 2: correcting autocorrect.\\n\\nUpdate: Man this blew up!  So a couple of things to clarify from the comments and an update.\\n\\n1. I'm male, for those who find that weird Gordon Ramsay would like a word with you.  Also the deer on my wall at home don't care. \\n2. The southern office is in the southern part of a northern state and we're in the northern part of the same state so we call it the southern office.  So all the true southerners are off the hook.\\n3. The CEO is technically out of both offices but primarily out of the northern office.  This was apparently caused by a southern office coworker who he won't name assuming that the northern office got the cookies all the time and this got their feeling hurt that they didn't so they decided to complain to the CEO that I wasnt being fair in my cookie distribution and that I was insulting the southern office by not bringing them.... \\n\\nI almost wish my imagination was good enough to make this up.\\n\\nUpdate: So I told my immediate supervisor about this, this morning and his response was about this, \\\"I wish I couldn't so easily believe that the southern office could be that petty but I can.  Well if the CEO wants you to make cookies you're making cookies. If he doesn't like it then he should have stood up for IT against this stupid pettiness.\\\"\\n\\n\\nFinal update:  Oh man did this blow up WAY more than I expected. I appreciate everyone's advice. Some more than others.  \\n\\nTo those who took the time to phrase things professionally, you have my thanks for ideas on how to say it.\\n\\nTo those who suggested adding extra to the cookies or intentionally messing them up.  Ya no, I'm not disrespecting Great Grandma's cookies like that.  \\n\\nMy immediate supervisor is, irritated shall we say, with the southern office but more irritated with the CEO for not cutting it off at the source.  (Apparently word of the complaints reached him after I told him from a different source.) So he's onboard with me making them on company time.  Just irritated with everyone EXCEPT me and agrees with me that this whole thing is stupid.\\n\\nThe irony is I was already planning to make a batch for the southern office for my trip next month, AND I ALREADY had finished dough in the freezer for a northern office batch. \\n\\nI'm thinking this'll be my last batch and when people ask I'll let them know that the southern office complained so I stopped baking for both so no one has anything to complain over. \\n\\nYes it'll cause some minor office drama, but it'll be against the southern office generally and not me for as others have said, \\\"ruining a good thing by complaining.\\\" \\n\\nTo those who found this hilarious, I suspect that once I have some distance from this I'll agree with you.\\n\\nThank you to everyone and I hope you all have a great rest of your week and may any discussions with your CEOS be smoother than mine and drama free!\\n\\nFinal final update!  I mean it!\\n\\nNo I'm not going to share the recipe. It's Great grandma's recipe.

I can't come to terms with the fact that as I'm coming to 30, never have I felt more certain that the idea of a 'career' or working for the rest of my life in some repetitive job just to support my housing, family and retirement, is just NO life.\\n\\nI'm not sure if it's bad experiences, or not knowing what exactly it is I want to do. Heck, I'm being paid 55k, but have already decided I will resign before the end of the year, leave London, and move back to my hometown (where opportunities are limited). This is simply because, after several years of slaving it out in an office, I so desperately miss feeling PURPOSE in life. Whether that's living under mum's roof and feeling the love of living with my family, being at University, and being surrounded by some of the best friends and richest experiences, being young and adventurous, traveling. Living life. \\n\\nEver since I graduated and got into the 'workforce', aka, sitting at my corporate desk all day every day, life has been a misery. Eeach and every day typically morphs into the same scenario, wake up early, feel tired, commute, spend x hours under intense stress, commute home, change, cook, wash dishes, maybe go gym, bed, repeat. Then the weekend. Even weekends are duller than they used to be because people are so busy or spend time with their other halves or whatever else.\\n\\nI came to realise through a lot of self-reflection during lockdown, that it's not the job, or the industry (I changed industry to mix it up and try something new). I realised that selling all of my time just to receive a paycheck, is nonsense. To the point where I'd rather resign and be unemployed whilst preparing for long-term travelling. It's strange because I want someone to tell me I'm barking mad, to leave a nice paid 55k job in the city for what I want - but you can't help what you feel. I'd imagine it's like a gay person and bottling up their feelings and then eventually coming out. For me, the truest thing I feel in my heart is that I just don't want to work 9-5 for the rest of my life, full stop. I want more out of life than living for the weekend, than defining my life and value by my 'work'. I can't derive value from anything else because I spend 80% of my waking time at work/commuting. No job has ever brought me any sense of purpose in life. It just draws me down further, gradually.\\n\\nI just think it's an incredble shame, that we spend our lives in the pursuit of careers, selling our health, our time, our relationships and everything else just to put money in the bank and jump on the old societal bandwagon of buying a house and settling down. I thought after going into uni and then into the exciting world of financial services, that I had life set. But suddenly, I could not want it less. Even the idea of spending 30 years paying off a mortgage disinterests me. I find it a grim and miserable idea. What's wrong with me? But scarily, there's no viable alternative.

I went through five different interviews. My first was an initial screening with a recruiter. The second an interview with HR. My third was an interview with the VP of revenue and operations. My fourth interview had the same VP another VP of enterprise as well as the strategic account manager. The fifth interview I got a tour of the building got to meet all of my peers and talk about the business plans for the future. The company is a conglomerate of four brands that supply things to schools and businesses. \\nA week goes by and I get a call from HR saying that she has some exciting news for me. I was loved by everyone I interviewed with and they saw a promising future for me with the company so much so that they thought I was overqualified for the role I was applying for and that they were creating a new elevated role within the company they thought I would be perfect for. I just needed to wait for the formal job description to finalize and I would need to interview with two more people. \\n\\nToday was the day of my interview and I never had a chance. I have no idea what was wrong but I\\u2019ll describe to you the interview with the east coast territory sales manager. \\nI started off thanking the man for being here today and taking the time to meet with me. I was excited and looking forward to working with and learning from someone who had over 20 years in the technology sales industry and I had really been looking forward to today. \\nHis response was \\u201coh you think you know about me i only heard about you two days ago.\\u201d\\nDefinitely not off to a good start.

Im going to apologize for everyone because you obviously have no idea what you are applying for. I don\\u2019t think they took the time they needed to prepare you for this because this is only for the k-12 department.

I recently had the opportunity to interview for the Inside Account Representation role and I wanted to bring to your attention an unfortunate experience I had during my 5th interview session. I believe it's important to address this matter as it greatly impacted my perception of the company and the potential role I was excited about.\\nDuring my interview with (name) the East Coast Territory Sales Manager, I encountered behavior that left me deeply unsettled and disheartened. I was met with disrespect, dismissiveness, and belittling comments that I found to be unprofessional and incongruent with the positive and inclusive culture that I had previously encountered throughout the interview process.\\nI want to emphasize that I hold the utmost respect for (company) and the values it upholds. My intention in sharing this experience is to ensure that the company's commitment to fostering a respectful and inclusive environment continues to be upheld, even in challenging situations.\\nI understand that interactions can sometimes be misinterpreted, and I did take into consideration that this could potentially be a potential hazing to see how I performed under pressure but I don\\u2019t believe that berating a possible candidate over the course of an hour is a ethical practice. However, I strongly believe that open communication is key to addressing such concerns. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter further and provide more context.\\nMy aim is not to escalate the situation unnecessarily but rather to contribute positively to the betterment of the company's interview process. I believe that addressing this issue transparently will help maintain the strong reputation that (company) holds within the industry.\\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to any insights or guidance you may offer regarding this situation.\\n\\nBest Regards,\"", "title": "What to do after a Hostile interview?", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/15nxq3u/what_to_do_after_a_hostile_interview/"}, {"author": "DownfalI", "created_utc": 1685969282.0, "link_flair_template_id": "682e2d40-78e2-11ea-b9b2-0e4e69ee6911", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "num_comments": 740, "post_id": "141dhdj", "score": 1163, "subreddit": "careerguidance", "text": "\"Hey everyone,\\n\\nI'm seriously considering rage quitting my job and I'm curious to see what you guys would do if you were in my shoes.\\n\\nIt's an internship (I'm still in college) at a big company in a prestigious field.

I have a touch base with lead today..how do I nicely state they should be compensating based on performance?\\n\\n*edit to add - I have about 10 months left until I receive my bachelors and there is no requirement to stay after that point luckily. I was hoping to get at least somewhat closer to what I deserve even while working to complete that. Guess I am going to continue trying to make my case for now\\n\\nIf anybody has any suggestions on getting a job in market analysis and if I would have better luck there, I would love to hear. I\\u2019m open to learning SQL and don\\u2019t have a passion for finance, but I do enjoy researching and digging around in data. Marketing has always been in the back of my mind, as my bachelors will be an accounting degree with a minor in marketing.\"", "title": "I got a dollar raise for a promotion I waited years for..now what?", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/15g86e3/i_got_a_dollar_raise_for_a_promotion_i_waited/"}]
