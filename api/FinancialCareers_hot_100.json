Thought it may be of interest to some of you to provide an hour-by-hour breakdown of a good day vs. a bad day in banking. This is just based on my own personal experience and every day was pretty different so treat this as a bit of a general overview.   \\n\\n\\n**A Good Day**\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what a good day would look like and I\\u2019ll assume I\\u2019m mainly working on a few marketing books which means we haven't signed on the client yet and we\\u2019re just trying to win business \\n\\n* **8:30AM:** Wake up around and scroll through \\\\~20 emails and see that nothing requires immediate attention so snooze for another 15 minutes. Luckily, I live super close to the office (a must do if you\\u2019re a banker) so I get ready and get to the office around 9:30AM \\n* **10:00AM:** I get my desk set up and answer a few emails but given that my projects are pretty quiet, I ask my analyst buddy if he\\u2019d like to go get a breakfast burrito with me \\n* **10:30AM:** I hurry back to my desk for a conference call for a potential IPO that we\\u2019re working on. Luckily as an analyst, you don\\u2019t ever have to say anything so I quietly eat my burrito and take notes I can send to my team \\n* **10:30AM - 12:30PM:** For the next few hours, I start working on spreading trading comps which is one of the ways to value a company for a marketing book I\\u2019m working on. Trading comps entails going through financial statements, looking up financial metrics, and copy pasting them into an excel spreadsheet. At first it was fun, but now that I\\u2019ve done this hundreds of times, it\\u2019s a little boring. \\n* **12:30PM:** It\\u2019s now around lunchtime and I go out with a few analysts and associates to grab a sandwich to eat back at the desk.\\u00a0 \\n* **1230PM - 3:00PM:** I scarf the sandwich down and get back to work on the trading comps and start double checking all my numbers. I then create a nice chart to showcase all the numbers and print it out for my associate. Since I got my pages done, now I can relax a bit for my associate to check over the work. I check on my NBA fantasy team, start texting my friends to see what plans they have for the weekend, etc. \\n* **5:00PM:** My associate is done checking over the page and says the numbers look good but wants a few formatting changes, so I quickly make those and send the full presentation to our team for their review. We now play the waiting game again, and this is often why bankers stay late into the night. Even though we finished our pages by 5PM, our Managing Director is out there having a life and responding ASAP to some analysts still in the office isn\\u2019t exactly his number one priority \\n* **7:00PM:** I go back to surfing the web and grab dinner to bring back to the office and finally get our comments at 7PM. Our MD gives us a list of 15 changes, which isn\\u2019t too bad since they\\u2019re all pretty quick fixes. \\n* **7:00PM - 9:30PM:** For the next few hours, I finish up all the changes and send it over to my associate and VP, who are both at home now. They both check over everything and give me a few more comments. I make those changes and send them back the revised version. \\n* **10:00PM:**\\u00a0Team gets back to me saying the presentation is good to go. I send it to our printing office who creates prints and binds the books into professional looking booklets \\n* **11:30PM:**\\u00a0I pick up the books from the printing office and drop them off at my MD\\u2019s desk and call an Uber home \\n* **12:15AM:** I take a quick shower and crawl into bed, watch a show and crash \\n* **Commentary:** This is a relatively easy day even though I didn\\u2019t necessarily leave the office early (sometimes I would leave from 8PM-10PM on some really really good days). But the work wasn\\u2019t intense and there was some waiting around which feels a little more like free time. \\n\\n**A Bad Day**\\n\\nNext up is a bad day, and here, I\\u2019ll be assuming I\\u2019m on an intense live M&A deal \\n\\n* **7:00AM:** The worst start to a bad day is that you haven\\u2019t slept much the day before so let\\u2019s say I slept at 3AM and am now waking up at 7AM \\n   * Not only did I not get much sleep, sometimes, my seniors or clients might be on the East Coast, which means I have to wake up early since I worked on the West Coast \\n   * I wake up to 50 emails and slightly panic because 10 minutes ago, my MD asked for some changes to the presentation I sent out last night in advance of our 9AM call \\n   * I email my associate that I am working on the changes on my phone and boot up my computer which is just a few feet away from my bed \\n   * I work like a madman for an hour turning comments and send it to my associate and while waiting for comments, I brush my teeth and put on my suit \\n* **8:30AM:** By the time I\\u2019m in the office, my associate has provided me a few comments and after making them, I send it off to the client \\n* **9:00AM:** I have a short breather for about 5 minutes before jumping on a conference call with a client. Let\\u2019s say that we\\u2019re in the beginning stages of an M&A deal and the call is about valuation \\n   * For the next 30 minutes, I take notes on the call and at the end, I learn that the client has finished making changes to its management model and will be sending it to us right after the call so we can build financial models based on their figures \\n* **9:30AM:** Right after the call, the model is sent to us, and my associate and I each take the next 2 hours going through the model and trying to understand how everything flows (any reputable company will have an internal financial model it uses to project its next few years). Bankers use this model to build out valuation materials but these models can often be really hairy, confusing, and unorganized \\n   * Usually it takes more than 2 hours to dissect a management model if it\\u2019s really complicated, but let\\u2019s just say for our purposes it takes 2 hours to briefly look through all the tabs \\n* **11:30AM:** My associate and I discuss the questions we have in the model and set up a call with the client at 12PM \\n   * In the meantime, my Managing Director wants the latest information about the company, so I compile the latest equity research reports of our client and send it to him \\n* **12:00PM:** My associate leads the call and asks our questions about the model while I take notes and during this time, my co-worker drops off a salad at my desk since I won\\u2019t have any time to grab lunch myself \\n* **1:00PM:** My associate and I run into a meeting in our MD\\u2019s office to discuss what we need to do. \\n   * Our MD lays out to us the presentation materials he wants page by page, referencing old materials we can recycle and update and laying out the financial analysis that we need to do \\n   * During this meeting, my associate and I are furiously taking down notes so that we don\\u2019t miss anything \\n* **2:00PM:**\\u00a0I scarf down my salad which is the first thing I\\u2019ve eaten all day and then get working on the model first while my associate puts together a shell of the presentation \\n   * Over the next 5 hours, I\\u2019m using the management\\u2019s model to create a discounted cash flow analysis which is one of the ways to value a company \\n* **7:00PM:**\\u00a0I send over the model to my associate who starts checking over it while I work on the rest of the presentation which involves updating market overview slides and spreading trading and transaction comps. I also hop on a food order with my colleagues for dinner during this time \\n* **8:00PM:**\\u00a0My associate gives me changes to make to the model which I refocus my attention to and work on for the next 4 hours \\n* **12:00AM:**\\u00a0I\\u2019m finally done with the next draft of the model, which I send to my associate, who tells me to work on the other parts of the presentation and focus on the model tomorrow \\n* **4:00AM:**\\u00a0I finish making updates to the market overview pages, finish spreading the trading and transaction comps, and send all of these materials to my associate and then head home to crash \\n* **Commentary:** It's certainly possible to have 1-4 weeks of many 2AM-4AM nights in a row.

I\\u2019m now a 3rd year Investment Banking Analyst in M&A at a reputable boutique (think Raine / Union Square Advisors, etc.) and currently in the process of interviewing for my next role in private equity.\\n\\nI am also an interviewer for full-time analysts at our bank.\\n\\n**The purpose of this post** is to provide a guide for those that have an interview or multiple processes kicking off within \\\\~2-3 weeks and don\\u2019t have time to do the extensive prep that everyone suggests (e.g. reading all of Rosenbaum & Pearl, understanding all the detailed accounting nuances in 3-statement modelling, etc.)\\n\\n**Before we dive in,** I am mostly providing this guide for those interviewing for **investment banking** positions. The reason, aside from my experience here, is that for most of the high finance roles that finance prospects are seeking (e.g. **private equity, venture capital, hedge fund**), investment banking is often a pre-requisite before you are taking seriously.\\n\\n**This guide is not for you if** you are interviewing for consulting, asset management, private wealth management, corporate banking, commercial banking, direct / commercial lending.\\n\\nNow, without further ado, here is my recommended **2-week (14 day) study plan:**\\n\\n**Days 1 \\u2013 5: Baseline Technical Preparation:** The 400 Investment Banking Questions & Answers\\n\\nLink: [https://www.academia.edu/36852692/The\\\\_400\\\\_Investment\\\\_Banking\\\\_Interview\\\\_Questions\\\\_and\\\\_Answers\\\\_You\\\\_Need\\\\_to\\\\_Know?auto=download](https://www.academia.edu/36852692/The_400_Investment_Banking_Interview_Questions_and_Answers_You_Need_to_Know?auto=download)\\n\\nThis is your bible for technical questions. If you know every Q&A in here, you are ready for 90% of the technical that will be thrown your way, so I recommend the first week to be completely dedicated to this.\\n\\nMake sure as you go through this, you are understanding the reasons behind every answer. If you don\\u2019t know a term, search it up. Focus on the \\u201cBasic\\u201d questions in each of the sections in this guide. That will cover about 80% of the technical you receive. The \\u201cAdvanced\\u201d questions will occasionally pop up, but are much less likely (\\\\~10%)\\n\\nIf you have the chance, definitely go through them as well, but if crunched on time, much more important to fully understand the \\u201cBasic\\u201d\\n\\n**Days 6 \\u2013 7: Group-Specific Technical Preparation**\\n\\nThis will be a bit more nuanced depending on which group you are interviewing for. I am mostly an M&A guy, and the Basic + Advanced sections of the previous guide are pretty much all that\\u2019s necessary. However, if you are interviewing for any other group, wallstreetoasis.com is your best friend.\\n\\nSearch up specific technical for you group on that site. Try and contribute an interview review to the site, which will give you access to the company database. This contains interview reviews on many different financial institutions, and you **there\\u2019s a solid chance you can find specific interview questions for the company you are interviewing for in the reviews!**\\n\\n**Day 8: Resume Walkthrough**\\n\\nEvery interview will kick off with \\u201cTell me about yourself\\u201d / \\u201cWalk me through your resume\\u201d / some variation of this question\\n\\nRehearse in front of a mirror / record yourself (I used Photobooth on Mac) doing this many many many times. Your walkthrough should be \\\\~2-3 minutes and follow the below structure:\\n\\n1. *Background (\\\\~10 \\u2013 20 seconds)*: Where you were born / raised and what interested you in finance / why you chose your college\\n2. *Early College Path* (*\\\\~20 \\u2013 30 seconds*): Talk about what your major choice was / why, and any research / internships you had done\\n3. *What Brings You Here Today* (*\\\\~30 \\u2013 45 seconds*): Here you establish the \\u201cspark\\u201d that led you to pursue the role your interviewing for and how the role fits in your 10 year plan\\n\\nExample Answer:\\n\\n\\u201c*I was born in the UK, but raised in Manhattan. I grew up very interested in the markets, and have traded my own personal portfolio since high school. For college, I decided to attend Harvard given their strength in economics and well-rounded education program*\\n\\n*At Harvard, I majored in economics, joining the HBS Investment Club in my first year, where I began understanding the nuances of valuation and the key metrics in evaluating the potential of a business.*  *This inspired me to pursue a role at \\\\[x\\\\] family office during my Sophomore summer, where I evaluated both private companies and public equities for potential investment.*\\n\\n*Through this internship, I discovered that while I enjoyed trading public equities, my passion really came from being able to dive deep into a company\\u2019s business and financial profile in order to understand how their strategic decisions allow them to outperform their competitors and the broader market. Therefore, this role as a Summer Analyst at JP Morgan in M&A will provide an excellent opportunity for me to fully continue pursuing detailed analysis of businesses, and I believe my perspective coming from an investing background will allow me to add value during this internship program.\\u201d*\\n\\n**Day 9: Behavioral / Fit Preparation (Part 1: The Generics)** \\n\\nThe 400 Questions have a lot of these questions in there and suggested responses. The below are the ones I have personally gotten / ask in my interviews:\\n\\n1. 3 Greatest Strengths and Weaknesses\\n2. In your last role, what would your boss say about you?\\n3. How do you deal with a teammate that you disagree with?\\n4. Do you prefer working independently or in a collaborative environment?\\n5. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? (hint: say something about a long term career in whatever you are interviewing for)\\n6. What do you do for fun?\\n7. Tell me about a recent book you read and liked.\\n\\n**Day 10-11: Behavioral / Fit Preparation (Part 2: Why Us? / Do you know what we do?)**\\n\\n1. Why do you want to work at \\\\[x\\\\] Bank / \\\\[y\\\\] Group / \\\\[z\\\\] Industry?\\n2. Why Bulge Bracket vs. Boutique?\\n3. Tell me about a recent deal that you read about.\\n4. Have you read our website? Tell me what you think about a recent transaction we advised on.\\n5. ELI5 \\\\[x investment banking role\\\\]\\n6. What are the tasks you expect to do here?\\n7. What do you think a deal process look like here?\\n\\n**Day 12: General Business Sense / Case Preparation**\\n\\nYou will encounter these scattered throughout, and they can take a number of forms. Broadly speaking there are **3 categories**: **(1) Business Strategy Questions, (2) Market Sizing, (3) Brainteasers.** Again the 400 questions guide has a bunch of these.\\n\\nThe first category is the most vague, and can take the form of \\u201cWhat are the key aspects of a successful business in x industry?\\u201d / \\u201cYou have a company with $50 million in revenue, growing at 40% annually but with negative EBITDA margins. If you were advising this company on a sale, what would you ask management?\\u201d / \\u201cHow would you think about valuation for a lemonade stand in Manhattan?\\u201d\\n\\nThese questions are extremely variable and the best way to prepare is to familiarize yourself with common academic frameworks (SWOT analysis, Porter\\u2019s 5 forces, etc.)\\n\\nThe second category is classic consulting-like market-sizing questions, e.g. \\u201cWhat is the market size for toothbrushes in the US?\\u201d / \\u201cHow many rats are there in New York City?\\u201d / \\u201cHow many people die in the US each year?\\u201d\\n\\nThis is just practice, and I frankly don\\u2019t have much advice here besides googling consulting case questions for these. However, keep it simple and don\\u2019t break the market down into 15 segments and not be able to calculate the final answer. Make sure you walk the interviewer through each step as you work through the solution.\\n\\nThe third category is classic IQ-question like brainteasers, which can encompass puzzle questions, mental math, probability, etc. This is quite rare, but you will likely encounter at least 1-2 of these. I don\\u2019t recommend spending too much time prepping for this part, as they are rare and don\\u2019t often make much of a difference if you nail everything else.\\n\\n**Day 13 - 14: Loose Ends & Rehearsal**\\n\\nThis is flex time for whatever you haven\\u2019t finished in the last 2 weeks. If you have completed all the previous steps, some recommendations:\\n\\n\\\\-**Google your interviewer** if you know their name and see if you have any overlapping interests / experiences. If you bring these up early on in the interview, you can sometimes sidetrack the interviewer into talking about this for a good chunk of the time, lowering the amount of time they have to drill you on technical\\n\\n\\\\-**Read up on industry / company news** for the firm you are interviewing with\\n\\n\\\\-**Go back to the 400 questions and go through the Advanced section**\\n\\n**-Rehearse your Resume walkthrough like a madman.** First impressions can often determine the tone and difficulty of the rest of the interview\\n\\nGood luck my fellow monkeys.\"", "title": "Breaking into High Finance: 2 Week Study Plan for the Unprepared", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/jg3jfj/breaking_into_high_finance_2_week_study_plan_for/"}, {"author": "None", "created_utc": 1597899766.0, "link_flair_template_id": "9094df74-f095-11ea-aeb0-0ee93ebd35c7", "link_flair_text": "Memes", "num_comments": 87, "post_id": "id4427", "score": 1073, "subreddit": "FinancialCareers", "text": "\"\"", "title": "wallstreetoasis in the real world", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "url": "https://i.redd.it/yak45bgva3i51.png"}, {"author": "senwell1", "created_utc": 1708540588.0, "link_flair_template_id": "668300ec-f614-11ea-8a09-0e51d2cf5475", "link_flair_text": "Profession Insights", "num_comments": 89, "post_id": "1awjlec", "score": 1065, "subreddit": "FinancialCareers", "text": "\"\\\"Please fix.\\\"\"", "title": "Looks like AI won't be replacing new analysts", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "url": "https://i.redd.it/0bkb4x2dgzjc1.jpeg"}, {"author": "Huckleberry_Holiday", "created_utc": 1643301855.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 79, "post_id": "se2n7h", "score": 1065, "subreddit": "FinancialCareers", "text": "\"I don\\u2019t shower often, and I don\\u2019t particularly care for my personal hygiene or eye contact.

During my schooling days every time I told people what I wanted to achieve out of life, I always get laughed at. To be honest, I was never a serious guy and I had always been the class clown. But, after experiencing the loss of my mother and my best friend to suicide at the tender age of 19. I was depressed and contemplated suicide multiple times. However, I wanted to make my mom proud and I was tired of being the 'plan B guy' and tired of being on the 'waiting list' thus I decided to focus on my goals.\\n\\n3 years later as a final-year student, I am an offer holder at J.P Morgan for a graduate programme. During my penultimate year, I received 3 internship offers from my national sovereign wealth fund (Fixed Investment), biggest national bank (Equity Research) and Citi (Retail Bank) which I ultimately took. I just wish I could celebrate all of my victories with my mom because she was the first person to believe in me, ever.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Apologies in advance for the massive schizopost, but people have to know what they\\u2019re getting into.\\n\\nThere is an abundance of \\\"Avoid Northwestern\\\" threads out there, but outside of the typical \\u201cthey make you call your friends and family,\\u201d or the \\u201c[they sell you expensive whole life insurance you don\\u2019t need](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/14hdate/just_infuriated_a_northwestern_mutual_guy_because/)\\u201d posts, I haven\\u2019t seen any that really disclose the behind-the-scenes borderline-MLM fuckery happening. Now, while the model isn't built on recruiting and earning residual income from recruits, I think there's a discussion to be had over how practices widespread in MLM cults seep into wider industry practices. In NWM's case, red flags include training that revolves largely around prospecting, widespread unethical practices that involve exploiting friends and family, [a weird cult-like atmosphere at conferences and meetings](https://www.thepitchkc.com/the-hard-sell-2/), and finally, how exactly their hiring process functions as a magnet for the under-informed and financially desperate. On top of this, seasoned ex-advisors with a conscience realize that the compensation structure is [at odds with upholding fiduciary duties](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/confessions-of-a-financial-advisor/) (more on this).\\n\\nI truly hope my experience will lead to some positive change and potentially prevent others from suffering needlessly.\\n\\n**----The Beginning----**\\n\\nWhen I received a referral to work at Northwestern, I was in a pretty rough spot in my life. I had been unemployed for roughly six months, I was living in a remote area with virtually no job prospects, and I was starting to put rent on credit cards. The situation seemed incredibly hopeless. I received a call from a recruiter in my home town who said she had \\u201cheard great things about me\\u201d from an advisor at the firm\\u2014 an acquaintance who I hadn\\u2019t spoken to in years. The company seemed reputable enough, after all, Northwestern Mutual has the [HiGhEsT FiNaNcIaL sTrEnGtH rAtInG](https://www.northwesternmutual.com/financial-information/), and some of my more established friends had policies through them, so it must be a good enough place to work. Truthfully, I was just happy someone wanted to hire me.\\n\\n**----The Interview----**\\n\\nThe interview process was exactly what you have probably already read in other posts\\u2014 they tell you how amazing you are, how it\\u2019s an incredible opportunity to live Life by Design\\u2122. They tell how you\\u2019re going to absolutely kill it, how you have an aura of trustworthiness, and how that\\u2019s what makes people successful in the business. They ask you about your relationship with your family and friends, reputational questions, deeper questions about purpose and what matters to you.\\n\\nDuring the third interview, my Managing Director revealed the results of a personality assessment. Based on my answers, I was categorized as a \\\"Rainmaker\\\"-- a personality trait common to the top x% of earners, or something like that. Truthfully, I am a bit worried about sharing internal documents, so I'll provide a high-level overview of my earning *projections*:\\n\\n*Annual revenue:*\\n\\n* By 40 years old: $860k\\n* By 50 years old: $1.6m\\n* By 60 years old: $2.5m.\\n\\nMy total career earnings were *estimated* at **$60 million, including a retirement package of** a single-life annuity worth **$200k per year** and a Persistency Fee Guarantee Fund value of **$1.5m yearly**.\\n\\nImagine how many people, with limited career experience and even less financial literacy, gawk at these numbers. I can't help but remember someone describing the career as a \\\"lottery ticket\\\" at a conference. Normally, I'd call bullshit, but let's be real. If there's a commonality between applicants, it is desperation. Financial Representatives don't usually accept a job at Northwestern Mutual from a place of abundance.\\n\\nAlong with several emails saying \\u201cWelcome Home,\\u201d they sent me an offer letter celebrating my \\\"aptitude\\\" and other traits. They welcomed me to a company \\u201cwhere you control your own destiny.\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\n**----The Training Process----**\\n\\nOkay, we all know that before your start date, you\\u2019re required to get your life and health insurance licenses and are **strongly** advised to bring in a list of 200 contacts. Nobody talks about what training is like.\\u00a0\\n\\nYour first day is the start of NM\\u2019s **Financial Planning Academy**\\u2014 part of their National Training Program, which is about 40-50 people in a crowded RingCentral call. Anyway, to call this complete waste of a time a \\u201cFinancial Planning Academy\\u201d is charitable. It\\u2019s, at best, life insurance sales training. To save having to list the entire schedule, here\\u2019s a quick gist:\\n\\n* Week 1: Design statements (alarming shit, more on this), learning how to prospect, learning sales language\\n* Weeks 2-3: Phoning to set appointments begins on your FOURTH DAY. Some product training (really, nothing substantial.) You learn some shit about [their financial planning software called PX](https://retirementincomejournal.com/article/northwestern-mutual-life-rolls-out-px-planning-experience-adviser-interface/?pdf=12948), which is no MoneyGuidePro. It's a glorified insurance recommendation tool.\\n* Week 4: You spend time in the office and **start compliance training on the last day. After you've called, messaged, and emailed 200 of your friends and family. This is like a regulator's wet dream.**\\n\\nIf Northwestern Mutual had a platform that properly educated its new hires on insurance **and** investments, maybe then its employees could market themselves as [Financial Advisors](https://www.northwesternmutual.com/financial-advisor/). Unfortunately, common sense doesn\\u2019t dictate that not being registered to offer financial advice means no one should trust you as a Financial Advisor. There are actually representatives two years into the business without securities licenses who are marketing themselves as  \\u201cfiduciaries\\u201d! Hope regulators turn a blind eye!\\u00a0\\n\\nMoreover, I was actively discouraged against pursuing securities licensing quickly by my \\u201cbusiness\\u201d coaches, because there was \\u201cso much to learn\\u201d about the business (of selling life insurance). The reality is, they don\\u2019t measure your performance by Assets Under Management or advisory business, they measure with insurance premiums. And ultimately, you don\\u2019t make boatloads of money selling term insurance. It was always about permanent life insurance, not advisory.\\u00a0\\n\\n**Okay, but onto the design statement thing\\u2026**\\n\\nThe first day of training featured presenting a \\u201cDesign Statement\\u201d in front of your training class, fellow representatives, sales support people, and upper management. I don't think a single post has talked about this. It's essentially a letter to yourself written by future you. You\\u2019re highly encouraged to be as vulnerable as possible, and emphasize how much the \\u201ccareer\\u201d at Northwestern Mutual has made a difference. I heard my fellow trainees share stories of poverty, unemployment, family problems, imposter syndrome, coupled with lavish dreams of becoming a millionaire in a few  years and buying their parents a house. They express how excited they are to no longer have to work a corporate job\\u2014 to have autonomy over their lives. Northwestern Mutual is a career unlike any other! It\\u2019s an *extremely* emotional affair. It\\u2019s a real \\u201cthis is the first day of the rest of your life\\u201d moment. Everyone is super supportive, and you leave feeling like you\\u2019ve joined a family of future millionaires. You're on a track to success, because everyone has told you the system is foolproof. You just have to put in the work.\\n\\nCompanies like Northwestern Mutual are microcosms of everything wrong with hustle culture. I do believe that if you're able, you should work hard to achieve things that are meaningful to you. However, hustle culture weaponizes meritocratic myths to justify unethical and unhealthy business practices.\\n\\nIf you're familiar with the MLM space, you're familiar with \\\"trust the system\\\" rhetoric. Successful representatives of companies like ACN or Monat will insist that the \\\"system works,\\u201d and elevate the incredibly small  percentage of representatives who become successful. The reality is, if the system was capable of producing these outcomes on a large scale, it would. Insisting that the \\u201csystem works\\u201d absolves the system of responsibility. Instead, these companies will market themselves as self-directed opportunities to create generational wealth for you and your family. If you fail, it\\u2019s just \\u201cnot for you,\\u201d or you simply did not work hard enough. The only thing getting in the way of your success is you.\\n\\nOkay, so how do you get paid?\\n\\n**----The Compensation Process----**\\n\\nHere\\u2019s what getting paid at NM looks like:\\n\\nNorthwestern Mutual has two programs to help kick off your \\\"business\\\": the Business Acceleration Program (BAP, basically commission % bonuses for the first couple years) and TAP (Training Allowance Program).\\n\\nTAP is how you make money in the beginning, so I\\u2019ll start here:\\n\\n* After training, your stipend is a conditional $2000/month, which is authorized by your \\\"coach\\\". You earn $500/per week if you make 40 dials, set 5 appointments and record 6 activity points per day (for putting new prospects into the CRM, taking a Fact Finder, etc.). There are additional new client bonuses, and a bonus for completing your securities licenses (again, not necessary or encouraged by admin).\\n* Suppose you work 40 hours per week,  that\\u2019s $12.50 an hour. You make below minimum wage, conditionally. (Also working 40/week is discouraged; training videos of NWM\\u2019s annual conference feature a salesperson touting that you have to be willing to work 3-4 nights per week when you start). Mathematically, you can quickly understand how, if you bring in 200 contacts, you run out of people to call quickly. Eventually, if you don't make your dials, you don't get paid. Anything. No proration. Simple as that. You can make your dials but not set enough appointments. No stipend, sorry. But hey, it's your business, and you can fail. Most businesses fail, so it's okay, right? Right?\\n* You have no benefits until your full-time contract flip date. Full-stop.\\n* Another note about the TAP stipend. The majority of people don't get their full TAP stipend. You can ask any rep. Missing the stipend is normal.\\n* If applying out of state, you are only reimbursed for your two most expensive licenses. If you leave before then, you can go fuck yourself!\\n* **If you leave, expect them to charge you for expenses related to holding a part-time contract. Chargebacks are common, but home office tries to nickle and dime you as you're walking out the door.**\\n\\n**----Joint Work and the Sales Process----**\\n\\nThe Northwestern Mutual solicitation process has multiple steps:\\n\\n1. The approach. A NM rep calls you, ideally keeping it as vague as humanly possible so as to not give away too many details, with the aim of setting an appointment to collect financial information for product recommendations. A typical script goes something like, \\u201cHey Michael! How are you? I know we haven\\u2019t spoke in a long time, but I\\u2019m really excited to let you know that I\\u2019ve started a financial planning practice. I\\u2019d love to borrow no more than 30 minutes of your time to see if I can help you reach your goals.\\u201d\\n2. The Fact-Finder: This is the first appointment where NM reps learn about you in order to make proper recommendations. Obviously, suitability is important. But advisors use this as an opportunity to \\u201ceducate\\u201d you on how insurance planning is a foundational element of financial stability. You get introduced to a \\u201c**Joint Work Partner**.\\u201d Typically, newer representatives are paired with more experienced representatives, to which they have little to no ongoing business relationship. So if you catch yourself in a meeting with one of your friends who is now a Financial Advisor, chances are they just met their \\u201cpartner\\u201d a few weeks prior. Wow, you should totally trust these people with your financial future!\\n   1. The \\u201cselling\\u201d may begin here. Usually you\\u2019ll get a \\u201chouse and buckets\\u201d explanation: imagine a multi-layered house representing your overall financial picture. Your \\u201cfoundation\\u201d includes an emergency fund, health insurance, **disability insurance** (marketed as \\\"income protection\\\" and life insurance. Your upper levels are brokerage and retirement accounts (which lol @ no investment license). They\\u2019ll probably woo you with NWMs \\u201cunparalleled financial strength\\u201d and so on.\\u00a0\\n3. Close meeting. Here, reps deliver the plan-- usually illustrations of what your career earnings would look like with and without disability insurance. You\\u2019ll probably get a recommendation for permanent life insurance, often with the justification of being an alternative to the stock market. \\\"With a whole life policy, you can save on taxes and keep your money off the roller coaster!\\\" I  had a representative try to sell an expensive WHOLE LIFE POLICY to a low income couple with no retirement savings or investment experience using that reasoning.\\u00a0\\n\\nJoint Work partners will take at least 50%, and if you leave, they keep the client. If your client cancels the policy, you get charged back for commissions paid.\\n\\n\\\\------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\\\----Leaving----\\n\\nLeaving the cult was one of the most stressful times in my life, bar none. After quickly realizing that the Financial Representative role wasn't for me, I started to look elsewhere. And when the team finds out, the tune changes *so* quickly, and the same \\u201cif people don\\u2019t support you, they were never meant for you\\u201d mentality is applied against you. I was made to feel guilty for \\\"giving up\\\" on myself and my dreams. I was told I was selling myself short. I was told that the company had already \\\"poured so many resources\\\" into me. I was told I was acting disingenuously by leading the company on to believe I was in alignment with their philosophy. I was accused of not \\\"believing in protecting your income\\\" when I expressed skepticism over blanket disability insurance recommendations. I was immediately removed as a LinkedIn connection from upper management. And on top of that, I was charged **hundreds of dollars for things never disclosed in my contract.** It was fucking awful.\\n\\nAnd, the real kicker is, the longer you stay in this as a rep, the higher the chances you'll deliver a death claim. And when you do, it's impossibly hard not to convince yourself the work you do is important enough to act unethically along the way.\\n\\nI truly feel bad for the people that get sucked into this. Northwestern Mutual is not an MLM but is predatory beyond belief. They sell you on a dream and expect you to rope your friends into supporting your new  \\u201cbusiness.\\u201d For the vast majority of people, it pays very little. And on the off chance that you do succeed, you\\u2019ve probably had to act unethically. You\\u2019ve probably jeopardized relationships selling life  insurance disguised as financial planning to your friends and family. Thankfully, I left less than a couple of months in for a much better job.\\n\\nAnd, the truth is, despite never delivering a policy, I still feel tremendous shame in having participated in something like this. I feel shame having contacted over 300 people out of the blue to talk about my new career. I wish I could tell them what an awful experience it was without seeming untrustworthy.\\n\\nIf you get approached by an NM Advisor, tread very, very carefully. I truly believe it is systemically difficult to maintain a fiduciary standard at Northwestern Mutual. Being tied to insurance product sales with a virtually non-existent base salary is exactly why people get recommended expensive whole life policies as a \\u201ctax-advantaged vehicle\\u201d instead of maxing out retirement contributions or adding to an emergency fund. It makes money for the salesperson.\\n\\nAnd if someone reaches out to you offering the FR job, please understand the full ramifications and make an informed decision, no matter how talented they say you are.\"", "title": "Opening Up About Northwestern Mutual", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/14tb3t8/opening_up_about_northwestern_mutual/"}, {"author": "heybaesss", "created_utc": 1676246322.0, "link_flair_template_id": "214d9cc0-f093-11ea-a0b0-0ec04c39cdc1", "link_flair_text": "Interview Advice", "num_comments": 86, "post_id": "110u4xc", "score": 920, "subreddit": "FinancialCareers", "text": "\"I know we always hear about what to NOT lie about - but here are the exceptions, as someone who has two parents high up in bulge brackets and I myself work in finance.

Pick hobbies that sound somewhat professional and interesting, even if you don't truly love them. I would say 95% of the time, you will not even be close with your co-workers or even true friends.

Lie about why you're looking. They do not want to hear that you're wanting this job because you hate the culture of your current company or because the pay is amazing.

Seriously did you do no homework or informational interviews?\\n\\n-Lack of technical prep: I would consider myself a pretty easy technical interviewer. I\\u2019m more concerned with concepts than whether or not you know the formula for WACC. That being said, I did a round recently where no one even knew what enterprise value was. I recently had a candidate who had a sibling in IB who couldn\\u2019t explain to me what an interest rate was. Do students not know how to use google these days? Pretty sure this is the most common technical interview question and I can\\u2019t really even get through my case study without you getting it. \\n\\n-Entitlement: I\\u2019ve interviewed some candidates that seemed bright but then we got to behaviorals and they indicate that some type of work is beneath them. As an intern, you\\u2019re going to be doing a lot of work that is not demanding intellectually in exchange for exposure to IB.

I only had one phone call with her where we talked purely about my experience, my drive, and why I want to work there.
