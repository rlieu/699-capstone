Whether or not that's the case for you, I sincerely hope this resume format helps you find a better job than you had going into this mess. In addition to having [S&G help how we can](https://sheetsgiggles.com/blogs/news/s-gs-response-to-the-covid-19-crisis),  I'm going to do my best to answer Reddit PMs and emails that come in re: job hunting during April as people face this crisis. (Please at least edit your resume into my format below before asking me for a critique, as my first advice to anyone who hasn't will be to guide you to my format.) All my best to you and yours, and I hope you're all staying safe out there.\\n\\n**11/17/2018 last edit (psyche):** I'm working 16+ hour days as CEO of [Sheets & Giggles](https://sheetsgiggles.com) nowadays, so I unfortunately don't have time to reply to PMs (get about 10 a day still). So sorry! If you have more questions, please see [this follow-up thread with FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8hs6xc/part_deux_of_the_top_post_of_all_time_on_rjobs_im/) I did a couple months ago. Good luck everyone! - Colin at S&G\\n\\n---\\n\\n#Original Post:\\n\\nThere was a recent post on Reddit where someone was lamenting that they had sent out dozens of applications, but hadn't heard back from anyone. I commented and told them they probably had a bad resume format and to PM me with it so I could review it for them, and about 50 other redditors ended up sending me their resumes to review. I don't have time to do all of them, so I decided to write this post and share a [downloadable editable Word doc resume format](https://sheetsgiggles.com/template) in the hope that it fulfills my personal obligations (*note: delete the footer before sending out!*). Here's a [preview](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y5sHcAI) of the resume.\\n\\nI'll keep it short and sweet, and hopefully many of you find this useful.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Source: This quick excerpt is from a longer [blog on my website](https://sheetsgiggles.com/blogs/news/sheets-and-giggles-fastest-growing-startup-in-colorado). My company ([Sheets & Giggles](https://sheetsgiggles.com)) makes sustainable eucalyptus bedding, so this is a little out there.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n**General resume advice:**\\n\\n* Use a professional-looking gmail, outlook, or personal domain email address. Delete your hotmail with extreme prejudice.\\n\\n* Don't put an objective section or summary. It'll be skipped, and it's space that can be used better.\\n\\n* Unless you have 20+ years' experience, make it 1 page. You can do it.\\n\\n* Don't put your full address. \\\"City, State\\\" is enough.\\n\\n* Name your resume \\\"\\u200bFirstName LastName Resume\\\" and that's it. Never submit it with \\\"(Project Management)\\\" or \\\"Final\\\" or \\\"2018\\\" or literally anything else in the file name.\\n\\n* If emailing your resume, always submit it as a PDF, never as a Word doc. You never know how wonky a Word doc will look on someone else's machine. If uploading to an online application that uses resume parsing software, you can upload the Word doc as well or if it's required to do so.\\n\\n* Try to read it in 10 seconds or less and see what you take away from it. That's about the initial screen time before someone makes an initial up/down decision, so you'll want to examine it from that perspective.\\n\\n* Interests are important because it gives the interviewer something to connect with you on, and it makes you more than just a faceless resume. If you put Seinfeld, I promise someone will ask you what your favorite episode of Seinfeld is (mine's the Soup Nazi).\\n\\nThat's the most important stuff. [Here's that resume template download link again](https://sheetsgiggles.com/template).

I'll get back to all questions in comments asap.\\n\\n**Edit 3:** my inbox is ruined, but having a blast helping everyone with their specific questions.

Lots of PMs to sort through too!\\n\\n**Edit 5:** See how clean those sheets are? [Accidentally shot a Tide ad](https://imgur.com/6Zc0YBm).\\n\\n**Monday night edit:** still answering PMs and comments :)! Hit me up anytime with your job hunting questions.\\n\\n**Wednesday edit:** over the last few days, I've responded to probably 500+ combined questions in the comments and PMs. PMs still rolling in. I think I'm going to make a \\\"resume and job hunting FAQ\\\" post based on these questions!\\n\\n**02/27/2018 edit:** PMs and comments still coming in, and I'm not even kidding when I say that I've had at least 10 people message me telling me they've gotten a slew of interviews since they switched their format, and two people have now told me they found jobs after switching to this format in the week and a half since I posted this. Unbelievable, makes me so happy.\\n\\n**03/28/18 edit:** Still owe a couple dozen more PM responses, bear with me. Also just got a few more messages from people describing how they found a job after switching to this template! Makes my day every time I get that message.\\n\\n**04/30/2018 edit:** I'll be posting something soon that answers all the resume and job hunting FAQs I've gotten from about 1,000 PMs!

Who cares if that person is stressed out? Business is still running as usual and will hold out as long as they can. By not hiring more and keeping the headcount low, profit goes up and whoever is in the upper management gets a nice bonus.\\n2. **False Hiring and PPP Loans.** Ranging from small businesses to large corporations, many have received Payment Protection Program (PPP) Loans that were supposed to be used for payroll and other expenses during the pandemic. However, many of the loans were abused and pocketed by owners and then later forgiven. A condition for these loans to be forgiven is if a company is \\\"actively\\\" trying to hire but cannot fulfill these positions. That's why people are struggling to get interviews as well as seeing jobs being posted over and over again. They had no intention to hire in the first place. Basically, it was a huge money transfer and the top ate well.\\n3. **Everyone is hiring.** No, they are not. Only retail and fast food positions that barely pay a living wage and high stressed are only hiring is what they mean. Not the comfy white-collar jobs with good benefits cause who would give that up? Even then, these places are running on skeleton crews as well.\\n4. **Mass Layoffs.** You have now a lot of people including whom have more than 12+ years of experience looking for jobs now. A good chunk of them are willing to take lower-paying jobs because they have no choice but to put food on the table and pay bills. Now the entry-level or junior-level position you are applying for has become more competitive. Employers have the luxury to be picky and want a unicorn to be a yes man, a bootlicker, someone who does not talk back, who is overqualified, and willing to take a pay cut as well. Also, a lot of these companies have a \\\"monkey see monkey do\\\" mentality. Once a couple of companies started doing layoffs, then other companies started doing it only because \\\"it must be the right thing to do right now\\\"\\n5. **The Feds actually want unemployment to go up.** They want it to go up because the justification is that no job = no money = reduction in savings = lower purchasing power = reduction in inflation. Higher interest rates would lead more people to hold off on purchases they do not need which put less money in circulation and bring down inflation according to the federal government. Also, Powell said it is to \\\"discipline labor\\\" as well. But of course, there isn't a problem with corporations making record profits during high periods of inflation. It is estimated that 70% of inflation came from price gouging in which corporations raised the price more than they needed to and mask it as inflation. Anything but to tax the rich right? I'm sure trickle-down will happen anytime soon.\\n6. **Anti- WFH Propaganda.** Throughout the pandemic, multiple reports proved that WFH has increased productivity and worker well-being that has not been seen pre-pandemic. WFH was positively received. But all of a sudden Return-to-Office was necessary as WFH wasn't working even though as long you have a computer, desk, and WI-FI, the same work that can be done at the office, can be done better from home in most people's cases. This is later revealed that a lot of bigger players are tied up in real-estate investment of these corporate buildings and that tax revenue around the surrounding areas has decreased as well which the local government does not like.  If you WFH, there is no need to buy food on the way to work or buy expensive lunch downtown, and then waste money on gas. However, with the big RTO push, a lot of employees are either resigning or outright refusing because why would you go backward on quality of life?  I even was disqualified from an interview for asking about remote policy but it is what it is.

This is why after a negative review is left, a company will routinely leave an onslaught of positive reviews to counterweight the negative one. Glassdoor is trash.\\n\\nAlso, some valuable nomenclature: an [*Active*](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/5-things-can-free-employer-account/) employer is one that uses the platform to respond to reviews and maybe some other trivial touchpoint engagement. An *Engaged* employer may be one that pays for the service. I'm inferring from the subtle threat in Glassdoor's own [content](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/opening-the-glassdoor-a-wise-move/).\\n\\n**EDIT 2**: Some people are pointing out that their algorithm had detected an identical review was submitted, which was the reason for my getting banned. Problem is, I didn't leave a second review. Like I said, the original review was live for 2 months and then it was removed for the reasons cited.\\n\\n**Original**: For the past few years, I've often defended Glassdoor as a useful resource as part of any job-seeker's overall job-seeking toolkit. \\n\\nAbout a year and a half ago, I interviewed with a company that had horrendous reviews. Literally, all 15 reviews were 1-star and for the same reasons. So in the interviews, I brought up some of the themes. The hiring manager, a decent man, admitted to all of it and said he was desperately and single-handedly trying to change those issues. So in this case, the negative reviews weren't a bunch of bitter employees; they were actual experiences and issues.\\n\\nI elected to join the company based on this honesty and the prospect of a challenge, and of course, it was exactly like how all those reviews had said it would be. It was awful. I was thankfully laid off due to COVID.\\n\\nAfter being laid off, I left a very detailed, thorough, cutting review that within a week of being posted, had 6 'helpful' upvotes or whatever. After two months, the review was removed suddenly for violating guidelines and so was every review I had ever written. Incredulous, I reached out to Glassdoor's content management team. They would not tell me exactly what the issue was, just that I was banned from participating in their community. Finally, a service manager emailed me to say they had some proprietary algorithm that had detected language that was in violation of Glassdoor's guidelines. To be clear, I didn't use any community guideline-violating language. Apparently, they detected an identical review had been written elsewhere.\\n\\n*I have a close family member that works for Glassdoor. I spoke to this person and found out that a very recent strategic repositioning for Glassdoor is that they are trying to become a PR company of sorts, so they are focusing on brand management for companies. As a result, they are getting very aggressive with negative review-takedowns while allowing very obviously fraudulent positive reviews to remain the same.*\\n\\nThis same company from which I was laid off, from June-August, posted 10 5-star reviews, each of which was of similar length, all with just about the same thing to say. Cliches like, \\\"great culture\\\", \\\"build your skills\\\", \\\"enlightened management\\\", \\\"cool tech\\\", \\\"takes care of employees\\\". I reached out to Glassdoor and asked them to use their \\\"proprietary algorithm\\\" to see if there was any fraud in that content, to which they said no, there was no violation.\\n\\nSo, what I'm getting at: with Glassdoor's supposed strategic pivot to brand management, it is becoming even less reliable than it was before.\"", "title": "A Warning About Glassdoor", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jbod57/a_warning_about_glassdoor/"}, {"author": "notABadGuy3", "created_utc": 1689844882.0, "link_flair_template_id": "dc491ca2-05ab-11e6-97de-0ec36f9f170d", "link_flair_text": "Interviews", "num_comments": 634, "post_id": "154lxsz", "score": 6511, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"This happened about a year ago.

I was unemployed for about 6 months. I was looking for $18/hour jobs, then I got an opportunity in software sales. I started at a base salary of $50k per year.

I was a little bit in panic mode by then. During the first 2-3 months I applied to literally every single PM job offer I saw but I didn\\u2019t even pass the second interview. Then a friend explained to me the 3-stage process she used to find her job. She also recommended a few AI tools that ended up being very useful. \\n\\nAfter 2 months of following her guidelines, I was offered 2 positions! 1 of them with a higher salary than the one I had in my previous company (ironically I took the other one, but for different reasons).   \\nI learned that finding a new job is a job in itself. You improve with practice and by failing. So the 3-stage process is designed to iterate fast. In every stage, I focused on \\u201cMastering that stage only\\u201d and improving on 1 metric:\\n\\n**Stage 1 Iterate my Resume**\\n\\nMy main focus in this stage was to improve the conversion rate of my resume. The metric I used was the % of responses I received. I kept refining and tweaking my resume until I achieved a solid ratio. I started with less than a 5% response rate (from *resume sent* to *first interview scheduled*). \\n\\nIn a shell I did this:\\n\\n* Adapt my resume for every position (I used a few tools, mostly kickresume explained below).\\n* When describing my previous experience, rephrase it using the exact key words used in the job offer. A lot of companies use software to filter resumes, so if they don\\u2019t find certain keywords, you are automatically rejected.\\n* Create a cover letter \\u201ctemplate\\u201d and leave some paragraphs to modify depending on each company.\\n* I created a notion page with a more detailed resume, with links to previous projects and a lot of details about me. I added this when asked for a \\u201cWebsite URL\\u201d (asked in many offers).\\n\\nOnce I started getting first interviews with HR managers or hiring managers (1st interview), I shifted my attention to preparing and improving my interview skills.  \\n\\n\\n**Stage 2 First interviews (usually with HR)**\\n\\nIn this stage, I aimed to increase the number of second interviews or technical exercises I was offered. This was a critical step in progressing further in the hiring process. I made sure to thoroughly prepare for these initial interviews, showcasing my skills and experiences effectively and I used a few tools (below) to practice my interviews.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll be asked the same questions again and again in these interviews with HR. With Otter you can transcript the meetings. So I created a document with \\\"Hard Questions in Job Interviews\\\" as a quick reference during interviews. I have the answers written there for all the typical questions. If you do online meetings, you can keep the doc open on your second screen \\ud83d\\ude1b\\n\\n  \\n **3 Use case (or technical exercise)**\\n\\nMy metric here was the number of job offers I received. This stage varies a lot depending on your role. I was applying for Product Manager, in case you are also applying for this role let me know and I can give you some examples of exercises I prepared in advance\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n Here are the tools that played a significant role in that process: \\n\\n **1 ChatGPT - Turned into a job interview trainer** \\n\\n You start by training ChatGPT on your resume. You can use this prompt:\\n\\n>As ChatGPT, you\\u2019ll be participating in an interview simulation for the position of Product Manager at \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_. I\\u2019ll provide you with your Resume in an upcoming message. Following that, you\\u2019ll receive the interview questions along with guidelines on how to respond. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n Then you copy&Paste your CV on ChatGPT. And you give it this new prompt:\\n\\n>The focus of this interview will be on your soft skills. When answering questions be clear and concise, using everyday language. Create convincing responses that an interviewer would appreciate even if they are fictional. However, ensure that your answers align with the experiences mentioned in your resume. \\n\\nThen ask ChatGPT the interview questions you may get and it will be generating perfect responses to any question.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n **2 kickresume.com**  \\n\\nUse it to improve your resume. You can do several things with it. Start your resume from scratch or modify one, create your cover letter with AI (it uses ChatGPT on the backend), or ask for feedback on your resume. I still needed to do a lot of manual changes in the version it creates but it is a great start. For cover letters, which can be quite a hassle to customize for each job application, it was a real-time-saver. Another option is Rezi, I haven\\u2019t tried it yet but it looks promising. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n **3 Wave.ai** \\n\\nIt provided a written conversation with a real human coach, utilizing AI to offer guidance and assistance. The coaching sessions helped me develop habits for finding the right jobs and mentally preparing for interviews. I used it a lot in stage 2. I would go to Wave with the answers I replied on every interview and they would help me improve them with feedback. Ultimately, they also helped me negotiate the offers. I\\u2019m so bad at facing conflict and asking for a higher salary, that my first instinct when I was offered the first job was to say OMG OF COURSE. I was able to raise the salary a bit and also the stock options they gave to me. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n **4 Otter.ai** \\n\\nYou can use it during your online meetings to take notes. During job interviews, it is not only important the content of your answer, but also how your answer is structured. And the only way to improve this is by practicing. With this tool,  I could review the questions asked and my responses, allowing me to refine and better structure my answers. Write down your answers and then use ChatGPT to improve them and structure them in a way that is easier to understand! \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n **5 Interview Warmup (from Google)** \\n\\nSimilar use to the first one with ChatGPT but in this case they ask you the questions. It simulates a real interview and gives you personalized feedback based on your responses. It can help you identify areas where you need to improve. Also, by practicing with these tools, I felt more confident and prepared for those higher-stakes real interviews.\\n\\n \\n\\nI hope this is helpful to you!\\n\\nAny other tool I should add?\"", "title": "I found a remote job in 2 months using AI tools and a 3-stage preparation process", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13uxdwu/i_found_a_remote_job_in_2_months_using_ai_tools/"}, {"author": "PersonMan42", "created_utc": 1705794762.0, "link_flair_template_id": "7f3169f0-3477-11e8-bd00-0e56aa346a78", "link_flair_text": "Work/Life balance", "num_comments": 242, "post_id": "19bpn65", "score": 5514, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"\"", "title": "Red flag phrases in job posts", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "url": "https://i.redd.it/cn58fyycgidc1.jpeg"}, {"author": "geeangidk", "created_utc": 1708818629.0, "link_flair_template_id": "adfd903c-05b8-11e6-b9a4-0e9a8fb8e6bb", "link_flair_text": "Rejections", "num_comments": 320, "post_id": "1az9bi4", "score": 5493, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"Currently job hunting.
