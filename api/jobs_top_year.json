Who cares if that person is stressed out? Business is still running as usual and will hold out as long as they can. By not hiring more and keeping the headcount low, profit goes up and whoever is in the upper management gets a nice bonus.\n2. **False Hiring and PPP Loans.** Ranging from small businesses to large corporations, many have received Payment Protection Program (PPP) Loans that were supposed to be used for payroll and other expenses during the pandemic. However, many of the loans were abused and pocketed by owners and then later forgiven. A condition for these loans to be forgiven is if a company is \"actively\" trying to hire but cannot fulfill these positions. That's why people are struggling to get interviews as well as seeing jobs being posted over and over again. They had no intention to hire in the first place. Basically, it was a huge money transfer and the top ate well.\n3. **Everyone is hiring.** No, they are not. Only retail and fast food positions that barely pay a living wage and high stressed are only hiring is what they mean. Not the comfy white-collar jobs with good benefits cause who would give that up? Even then, these places are running on skeleton crews as well.\n4. **Mass Layoffs.** You have now a lot of people including whom have more than 12+ years of experience looking for jobs now. A good chunk of them are willing to take lower-paying jobs because they have no choice but to put food on the table and pay bills. Now the entry-level or junior-level position you are applying for has become more competitive. Employers have the luxury to be picky and want a unicorn to be a yes man, a bootlicker, someone who does not talk back, who is overqualified, and willing to take a pay cut as well. Also, a lot of these companies have a \"monkey see monkey do\" mentality. Once a couple of companies started doing layoffs, then other companies started doing it only because \"it must be the right thing to do right now\"\n5. **The Feds actually want unemployment to go up.** They want it to go up because the justification is that no job = no money = reduction in savings = lower purchasing power = reduction in inflation. Higher interest rates would lead more people to hold off on purchases they do not need which put less money in circulation and bring down inflation according to the federal government. Also, Powell said it is to \"discipline labor\" as well. But of course, there isn't a problem with corporations making record profits during high periods of inflation. It is estimated that 70% of inflation came from price gouging in which corporations raised the price more than they needed to and mask it as inflation. Anything but to tax the rich right? I'm sure trickle-down will happen anytime soon.\n6. **Anti- WFH Propaganda.** Throughout the pandemic, multiple reports proved that WFH has increased productivity and worker well-being that has not been seen pre-pandemic. WFH was positively received. But all of a sudden Return-to-Office was necessary as WFH wasn't working even though as long you have a computer, desk, and WI-FI, the same work that can be done at the office, can be done better from home in most people's cases. This is later revealed that a lot of bigger players are tied up in real-estate investment of these corporate buildings and that tax revenue around the surrounding areas has decreased as well which the local government does not like.  If you WFH, there is no need to buy food on the way to work or buy expensive lunch downtown, and then waste money on gas. However, with the big RTO push, a lot of employees are either resigning or outright refusing because why would you go backward on quality of life?  I even was disqualified from an interview for asking about remote policy but it is what it is. Remote work is in hot demand yet employers refuse to acknowledge it.\n\nThere's more to why the job market is trash right now of course but this is JMO from all the reports and posts I have been reading.

I'm a little confused as this is the number listed on the advert. He proceeded to give a lecture on how much recruitment agencies inflate the price and warp graduates brains to expect higher salaries. I clearly didn't know my worth and I would be lucky to get a job with that salary. I was a bit taken aback by this and didn't really know how to react.\nSo I ask how much he would be willing to pay me. After insulting my github portfolio saying I should only have working software on there he says \u00a320k.\nAt this point I get up, shake his hand, thank him for the time and end the interview.\n\nI still get a formal offer in the form of a text message, minutes after me leaving.

Forcing employees back to the office would create more demand for surrounding homes/businesses, and affectively raise their portfolio value.\n\nThe other reason is control. The C-Suites job is to \"inspire\". They don't feel a sense of purpose without having you, the worker bee, around for them to view. They want to see you building their pyramid for them, even if it can be done remotely and more efficiently. It's a psychological thing that sociopaths in the C-Suite need. They're losing control, and they want to have it back to be more valuable since their perceived value is about steering the ship and not contributing anything meaningful.\n\nJust wanted to share and vent because I'm sick of this narrative. Remember the truth and ALWAYS bring it up.\n\nEDIT: Wow...I didn't expect to get this many responses. I just wanted to add that yes, there is frustration in my voice. I'm tired. I'm tired of the constant squeeze corporations apply to all of us daily. It's always happened throughout history, but it is MUCH worse now. Profit over People has never been more rampant then it is now. \n\nThe truth is, I believe this country is in desperate need of a workers rights movement. I would LOVE to see every talented individual out there push back against this RTO narrative that is solely based off \"a gut feeling\" from a handful of people. I'm just tired of being lied to, and it's a constant fight to keep the truth alive.\n\nAlso, to everyone that is saying things like \"suck it up and deal with it\", you're part of the problem. That dismissive attitude means you aren't open to change, and just accept things the way they are. You can change anything you want in this world, you just have to get enough people to say \"No\".\n\nTake care", "title": "Absolutely sick of the return to office hit pieces", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/16ayf5l/absolutely_sick_of_the_return_to_office_hit_pieces/"}, {"author": "euphoricunknown", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1699210585.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "17oiv65", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": false, "locked": false, "name": "t3_17oiv65", "num_comments": 1066, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/17oiv65/last_texts_from_my_toxic_ex_boss_lol/", "saved": false, "score": 5881, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "Can you believe this guy?

I was a little bit in panic mode by then. During the first 2-3 months I applied to literally every single PM job offer I saw but I didn\u2019t even pass the second interview. Then a friend explained to me the 3-stage process she used to find her job. She also recommended a few AI tools that ended up being very useful. \n\nAfter 2 months of following her guidelines, I was offered 2 positions! 1 of them with a higher salary than the one I had in my previous company (ironically I took the other one, but for different reasons).   \nI learned that finding a new job is a job in itself. You improve with practice and by failing. So the 3-stage process is designed to iterate fast. In every stage, I focused on \u201cMastering that stage only\u201d and improving on 1 metric:\n\n**Stage 1 Iterate my Resume**\n\nMy main focus in this stage was to improve the conversion rate of my resume. The metric I used was the % of responses I received. I kept refining and tweaking my resume until I achieved a solid ratio. I started with less than a 5% response rate (from *resume sent* to *first interview scheduled*). \n\nIn a shell I did this:\n\n* Adapt my resume for every position (I used a few tools, mostly kickresume explained below).\n* When describing my previous experience, rephrase it using the exact key words used in the job offer. A lot of companies use software to filter resumes, so if they don\u2019t find certain keywords, you are automatically rejected.\n* Create a cover letter \u201ctemplate\u201d and leave some paragraphs to modify depending on each company.\n* I created a notion page with a more detailed resume, with links to previous projects and a lot of details about me. I added this when asked for a \u201cWebsite URL\u201d (asked in many offers).\n\nOnce I started getting first interviews with HR managers or hiring managers (1st interview), I shifted my attention to preparing and improving my interview skills.  \n\n\n**Stage 2 First interviews (usually with HR)**\n\nIn this stage, I aimed to increase the number of second interviews or technical exercises I was offered. This was a critical step in progressing further in the hiring process. I made sure to thoroughly prepare for these initial interviews, showcasing my skills and experiences effectively and I used a few tools (below) to practice my interviews.\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked the same questions again and again in these interviews with HR. With Otter you can transcript the meetings. So I created a document with \"Hard Questions in Job Interviews\" as a quick reference during interviews. I have the answers written there for all the typical questions. If you do online meetings, you can keep the doc open on your second screen \ud83d\ude1b\n\n  \n **3 Use case (or technical exercise)**\n\nMy metric here was the number of job offers I received. This stage varies a lot depending on your role. I was applying for Product Manager, in case you are also applying for this role let me know and I can give you some examples of exercises I prepared in advance\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Here are the tools that played a significant role in that process: \n\n **1 ChatGPT - Turned into a job interview trainer** \n\n You start by training ChatGPT on your resume. You can use this prompt:\n\n>As ChatGPT, you\u2019ll be participating in an interview simulation for the position of Product Manager at \\_\\_\\_\\_. I\u2019ll provide you with your Resume in an upcoming message. Following that, you\u2019ll receive the interview questions along with guidelines on how to respond. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Then you copy&Paste your CV on ChatGPT. And you give it this new prompt:\n\n>The focus of this interview will be on your soft skills. When answering questions be clear and concise, using everyday language. Create convincing responses that an interviewer would appreciate even if they are fictional. However, ensure that your answers align with the experiences mentioned in your resume. \n\nThen ask ChatGPT the interview questions you may get and it will be generating perfect responses to any question.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **2 kickresume.com**  \n\nUse it to improve your resume. You can do several things with it. Start your resume from scratch or modify one, create your cover letter with AI (it uses ChatGPT on the backend), or ask for feedback on your resume. I still needed to do a lot of manual changes in the version it creates but it is a great start. For cover letters, which can be quite a hassle to customize for each job application, it was a real-time-saver. Another option is Rezi, I haven\u2019t tried it yet but it looks promising. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **3 Wave.ai** \n\nIt provided a written conversation with a real human coach, utilizing AI to offer guidance and assistance. The coaching sessions helped me develop habits for finding the right jobs and mentally preparing for interviews. I used it a lot in stage 2. I would go to Wave with the answers I replied on every interview and they would help me improve them with feedback. Ultimately, they also helped me negotiate the offers. I\u2019m so bad at facing conflict and asking for a higher salary, that my first instinct when I was offered the first job was to say OMG OF COURSE. I was able to raise the salary a bit and also the stock options they gave to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **4 Otter.ai** \n\nYou can use it during your online meetings to take notes. During job interviews, it is not only important the content of your answer, but also how your answer is structured. And the only way to improve this is by practicing. With this tool,  I could review the questions asked and my responses, allowing me to refine and better structure my answers. Write down your answers and then use ChatGPT to improve them and structure them in a way that is easier to understand! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n **5 Interview Warmup (from Google)** \n\nSimilar use to the first one with ChatGPT but in this case they ask you the questions. It simulates a real interview and gives you personalized feedback based on your responses. It can help you identify areas where you need to improve. Also, by practicing with these tools, I felt more confident and prepared for those higher-stakes real interviews.\n\n \n\nI hope this is helpful to you!\n\nAny other tool I should add?", "title": "I found a remote job in 2 months using AI tools and a 3-stage preparation process", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/13uxdwu/i_found_a_remote_job_in_2_months_using_ai_tools/"}, {"author": "PersonMan42", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1705794762.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "19bpn65", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": false, "locked": false, "name": "t3_19bpn65", "num_comments": 242, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/19bpn65/red_flag_phrases_in_job_posts/", "saved": false, "score": 5506, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "", "title": "Red flag phrases in job posts", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "url": "https://i.redd.it/cn58fyycgidc1.jpeg"}, {"author": "errorloadin", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1704222912.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "18wxjwa", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": false, "locked": false, "name": "t3_18wxjwa", "num_comments": 517, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/18wxjwa/i_just_want_a_job/", "saved": false, "score": 5381, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "\ud83d\ude2d like cmon now", "title": "I just want a job", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "url": "https://i.redd.it/yqcchuxot2ac1.jpeg"}, {"author": "Present-Amoeba-326", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1687394504.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "14fomea", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": true, "locked": false, "name": "t3_14fomea", "num_comments": 448, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/14fomea/in_tears_over_doubling_my_income/", "saved": false, "score": 5394, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "Just wanted to post my achievement here.

I had 2 calls and next was to be with the founder. Turns out the founder knew the CEO of my company. He called my CEO and said I was looking around. I was immediately fired with no severance. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve sent out thousands of applications and had tons of interviews. Most companies had 4+ rounds. 3 months later I get an offer but instead of remote like they initially said, they wanted me to work in their office on the other side of the country for six months before going remote.

I thought this would make them second guess their behavior because surely any rational person wouldn\u2019t want to make a potential employee feel unsafe? \n\nNOPE that\u2019s not how this went. They sent me long email back telling me that essentially the only way I could have this job is if I go to the owners house. They stated that they cannot hold meetings anywhere but their house due to \u201cinformation privacy\u201d concerns (please keep in mind this is not a government job or anything where sensitive confidential information would be exchanged). \nThey then went on to say that I could absolutely NOT bring anyone. So bottom line-I would have to show up to their home, alone. The kicker is they then stated that they\u2019re second guessing me as a candidate because I voiced these concerns and they only want \u201clikeminded\u201d \u201ccollaborative\u201d employees\u2026\n\nMoral of the story is listen to your gut and stay safe when searching for jobs.

I guess you can do whatever you want when you\u2019re friends with the supervisor.\u201d\n\nShe quickly deleted the message but not before me and 15 other people saw it. No I\u2019m not \u201cfriends\u201d with the supervisor, we are distantly related by marriage but have never been around each other outside of work. \n\nI heard she was turned into HR last year for bullying a girl into quitting but nothing came of it. I\u2019m on the fence of reporting her behavior to HR or just quitting for my peace.

I have seen some bad advice. \n\nFirst: Who am I? I work these days in technology but I've been a carpenter, I've worked in the marine industry as a boat captain and various scut work jobs, Ive been a graphic designer, and I have been a Product Management leader for 25+ years with VP, SVP and CPO titles. I've worked at huge companies, mid-sized companies and I've founded four companies, two of which I was the CEO. \n\nSo at the risk of pontificating, I thought I'd share some thoughts:\n\nFirst: People are looking for coworkers - meaning people who they like, who are at the same level of *competence* as the rest of the team (not experience), who get things done, who are reliable, and who are creative problem solvers. Even at unsophisticated jobs, being a creative problem solver is a huge plus. You have to come across as likable. And ideally you want the interviewer to start rooting for you to be successful. \n\nSo how do you do that? You have to arrive at an interview ready to tell stories that capture the interviewer's attention and illustrate your value. Most interviewers are not good at interviewing, so you need to help them along. \n\nThese days I screen for 4 things when I hire.  I believe these things are universally desirable and necessary in order to be successful at any job: Grit, Integrity, Empathy and Creativity. \n\nI believe that if you can exhibit and illustrate these four traits in an interview, you have a much better chance of being hired.  So what do these things mean, and how do you illustrate them?\n\n1. Grit:  this is the ability to get a task or project done, even if you run into obstacles. You need to illustrate that you have initiative, that you can identify and solve problems that are blocking you (sometimes this means asking for help, especially if you're junior), but mostly it means you keep on trying even if things get hard. \n\nSo have a story queued up that you can use to illustrate your grit. Tell a story about a really hard problem you had to solve. Summarize the background, explain what obstacles you ran into, and how you solved them. For a first job or if you're junior (1-3 years) telling a story that isn't work related is okay.  Or a situation where you recognized a problem beyond your skill level and escalated to get help from your boss or a senior colleague, and then completed the project. Sometimes showing that you're a team player and that you have the humility to ask for help is better than struggling alone. However, if you're more senior, showing that you know how to get things done independently is probably more important.\n\n2. Integrity: Are you trustworthy and reliable? Illustrate that you have integrity by telling about a time you had a moral or ethical quandary and had to make the hard decision to do the right thing. Or if you're brave, a time you did the wrong thing but learned from that failure. To be clear, I'm not talking about a time you made a mistake, I'm talking about the time you failed, the time you did the wrong thing, you knew it, you made the decision, and faced some consequences. Of course it's important that if you go down that path that your focus is on what you learned and why you won't make that mistake again. This can be really important if you have anything in your background that could become visible through a simple social media search or background check. Showing vulnerability in an interview, especially around integrity, can be the thing that gets an interviewer to start rooting for your success. \n\n3. Empathy: This is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, walk around, see things from their perspective, and make decisions based on that insight. I would tell a story about a time when you struggled to work with someone else, perhaps you didn't even like that person, perhaps you disliked that person. But then you suddenly had an insight into why they were acting the way they were, or what was driving them, you developed a sense of empathy for them, and were able to work through the issues. Maybe you forged a great relationship, or maybe you just found a way to get by with a difficult coworker. Either way this will illustrate empathy and the ability to collaborate with people even if they are difficult.\n\n4. Creativity: This one is a bit trickier. When I interview candidates, I ask a question designed to elicit a story about creativity. So be careful about how you interject this in the conversation. Tell a story about a time you figured out a solution to something difficult in a creative way, maybe talking about a business you started, even something as simple as a lawnmowing business as a kid or a project you did at church or a summer project.  I ask the person to tell me an idea they've had for a company or a product or a nonprofit or service and what is exciting about it to them. Then I ask them to think through several aspects of the idea and expand on it until they finally either prove that they can think things through and to end, or they run into a wall at some point. Either way, it's very illuminating as an interviewer.\n\nI hope this is helpful. Just remember, hiring managers are looking for team members. They're figuring out if they like you as well as if you're qualified. So it's really important that you let them look at you, the real you, so they can assess you for who you actually are. I've Filled people out of an interview process because they were too guarded and weren't letting me get to know them.\n\nOne last thing. As much as you are being interviewed, you should be interviewing them. Show up with good questions, do research about the company before you show up, and have a good reason for why you want to work there. If you discover that you don't like the people interviewing you , find out if they are someone you will have to work with every day or if they are not someone you will work with every day.

And still I have nothing to show for it.\n\nIt's completely soul shattering. I have no money and no savings left. My friends and acquintances have a life, do things, get married, make plans, give birth to kids, start mortgages, book trips. I can't do anything, because I don't have money and I am depressed because I feel like I have no future. And it's a self growing vicious feedback loop: I get constant rejections, so I get depressed, so I don't even bother applying because I will get rejected anyways, so I don't progress, so I get even more depressed.\n\nI spend every waking minute waiting for that email that could turn things around. Days go by painfully slowly. Some hiring manager that will care about me and give me a chance. But it never happens. And when Friday afternoon comes I get that oppressing sense of dread that comes from knowing yet another week has passed and now it's the weekend and no one will reply anyways, and then Monday will come and another week will pass and so on and so forth. It's a torture. It's exhausting.\n\nI am at the end of my rope. Not only I cannot find a skilled job, but I won't get considered for an unskilled one because I'm too old and qualified - not that a random unskilled job would help matters anyway since I'd barely have money to feed myself (my mom has to pay for my food right now) and I still wouldn't be building anything resembling a future and a career for myself, so I'd still be in the same place as I am now.\n\nI have studied for years and went repeatedly out of my comfort zone and now this.\n\nI've had an actual disease in the past. I still felt better than I feel now. At least I had something to be positive about. I had hope it would end. I knew that if I followed medical advice I'd come out the other side. Now it's out of my control. I can't control hiring managers deciding on a whim against advancing me to the next stage. I can't control the fact that even if I do a great interview there might still be something that I do worse than someone else. I cannot control the fact that each time there might be even just one single applicant who's slightly better than me. I can't control anything.

She didn\u2019t define \u201clook nice\u201d but I took this as dress up so that\u2019s what I did. I wore a dress, nice shoes, perfume, makeup, jewelry and had my hair curled. \n\nMany of my coworkers wore our company T-shirt and jeans. My boss wore jeans with a nice sweater but it was still jeans so not too dressed up.\n\nA lot of the clients talked to me like I was the boss. The division manager showed up (dressed on about the same level as me) and she gave me like this hateful looking stare which made me uncomfortable. Others said they liked my outfit but I wondered if they were just being nice. After looking at the Facebook photos and showing my family, they all said it was a nice dress.\n\nBut in the last two weeks, my direct boss has been kind of dismissive to me. I also feel like I was left out of a meeting I should have been on recently and some recurring ones that she scheduled. I can sense a change that I think is related to over dressing which was not my intention to outshine anyone. I just thought we were supposed to dress up. Any advice or similar experience?

If you want to contribute with your experience or advice, it\u2019s welcomed. Ultimately the theme is that people believe there is jealousy and insecurity in the leadership. Advice for how to handle this varied in the comments. I\u2019m taking them all into consideration in navigating this uncomfortable situation. Being the recipient of jealousy is indescribable really and is unfair to the recipient. I just hope everyone knows that someone else\u2019s talents, style, knowledge or potential is not a threat to who you are.
