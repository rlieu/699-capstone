Of those 8, 6 emailed me within days of applying for an interview. A CEO of a small contracting company also reached out to me when I added my resume on Monster. I'm not saying my resume is perfect (looking at it now, there are small things I want to change on it), and I'm not trying to brag. I just want to show that I must have done something correctly to just about get an interview anytime I applied, and I think it is because my resume is ATS-friendly and not cluttered.\\n\\nSo here is ONE of the resumes I created. Note that I actually made multiple resumes. For those that just made ONE resume and are trying to shotgun it to every job listing you see on Linkedin, or any other job board and have not heard a peep from any company, You might want to reevaluate our approach. You should be tailoring your resume to the job post. The Wiki mentions this, I believe.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf anyone would like, I can go over how exactly I created my resume according to the job post, either here on in a separate post.\\n\\nNow I will explain my resume format:\\n\\n**TITLE**\\n\\nThe title of your resume should be your job title. Plumber, Senior Electrician, Front-end developer, McDonald's Shift Lead, whatever. Generally, it's something people can understand from reading alone. My job title is what I had in the military and I couldn't think of a better one to use to cover all the radio things I've worked on so I kept it in. Normally the job title is also what you are applying for.\\n\\n**Summary**\\n\\nSummaries are supposed to be a short 3-5 line \\\"elevator pitch\\\". I strongly recommend you use a summary as it helps highlight and explain who you are and what you provide to the company. After I finished my interviews, I asked what helped my resume stand out and everyone said it was my summary. It's a little long, but I wanted to capture just exactly what I work on and also tailor it to the job post I was applying for. \\\\*Notice how I DO NOT have personal pronouns in my summary.\\\\*\\n\\n**Hard Skills**\\n\\nSo the section with bullet points is where I put my hard skills.  Hard skills are abilities that let you tackle job-specific duties and responsibilities. Hard skills can be learned and are job specific. They are NOT personality traits such as hardworking, organized, or time management. Those type of skills belong in a summary, in my opinion. You DO NOT type out a sentence for each skill. I keep seeing new people try to write a paragraph for each skill trying to explain how they got it or how they demonstrated it. Ideally, your work bullets will reflect some of these hard skills. A job post will have some listed that you can add if you're paying attention. I have slightly different summaries on my other resumes as well.\\n\\n**Certifications**\\n\\nThis field all depends on your career field. I cannot tell you what certifications you need. You should know what certification your career field requires or wants. If you don't know, start researching.  If you do have a certification, you just put the name of the cert, followed by the company that issued it and then the year you obtained it. That's it. If it is expired, renew it or remove it from your resume.\\n\\n**Professional Experience**\\n\\nNothing out of the ordinary here. I have the company I worked for (United States Air Force) and the location. I then have my job titles under it because my duties changed over the years as I promoted and moved to other locations. Your most recent job should have the most work bullets. Your oldest job and shortest job should have the least. YOUR JOB BULLETS SHOULD REFLECT THE JOB POST. If the job post is talking about working with or interacting with customers, you should mention something like this in your resume. Same for Engineers and developers. Again, creating bullets about an art project when you are applying to be a plumber makes no sense and should not be on there. \\n\\n**EDUCATION**\\n\\nThis is self explanatory. List the degree relevant to the job. A Master's degree in underwater basket weaving isn't going to do you any favors when applying to manage projects or write code. The job post will mention what degree the company is looking for as well as how much experience you need for them to waive not having a B.S. degree or M.A. degree. Some companies are very strict about it and will throw your resume away if it doesn't meet their requirements.\\n\\n**Technical Competencies**\\n\\nThis is where I would list things that I work with and am competent using. Here is where the specific radio equipment I've worked on will be listed as well as other equipment. For Networking personnel, this is where you mention the Cisco Switch, cable testers, Linux operating systems, and other things. You could also use this section for languages (code and spoken languages), software, or just anything you are competent with. THE JOB POST TELLS YOU WHAT THE COMPANY IS LOOKING FOR.   \\n\\n\\nAs I said before, this is only one of my resumes, but the format is exactly the same for all of them, even the master resume I pull my bullets from. My resume itself isn't perfect, but I believe it is easy to read and can give some new people writing a resume an idea of how a good one can or should look like. I currently have a job so I am not too focused on fixing up my resume write now, but I will add on to it over the years and tweak it every now and then so I am ready in case I need to use it again.    \\n\\n\\nFeel free to let me know your thoughts and I will be happy if I can help at least one person on here. Job search isn't always easy, and I want to help everyone succeed as long as they are willing to put in the work.

These are big mistakes that are potentially causing you to lose out on valuable opportunities and correcting them *should* improve the overall performance of your job search.\\n\\n# #1 Using the wrong layout\\n\\nThere's already another stickied post on this subject, but I still see people committing this mistake all the time. In short, don't use a two-column resume if you're submitting through company websites or job boards (i.e., Indeed, LinkedIn etc.).\\n\\n**Why?**\\n\\n**Short answer**: Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)\\n\\n**Longer Answer**: ATS reads your resume from top to bottom and left to right. When you add another column (or other incompatible elements for that matter, such as graphics or logos), you introduce another layer of complexity and make it harder for the system to properly read your resume. As a result, sections may get misread or not read all.\\n\\nUse a traditional, single-column format. I recommend creating your resume using Microsoft Word or Google Docs. There\\u2019s a basic Google Docs template in the wiki section of this sub - I\\u2019ll link it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wdkgpgU7lFoV801ysrBn8qrPaIpyUsUH/mobilebasic) for your convenience. \\n\\nI do not recommend using other programs such as Canva, Adobe InDesign, or Overleaf (LaTeX).\\n\\n# #2 Writing generic content\\n\\nTo begin, let me first define the term '**context**' which is going to be key here. Context is specific information that makes your resume and the descriptions within it unique to you. It allows the reader to understand and appreciate your story. A resume with zero context will sound generic - a lot like a job advertisement. Here's an extreme example:\\n\\nGeneric Statement:  \\\"*Achieved excellent sales results*\\\".\\n\\nSpecific/Contextualized Statement:  \\\"*Earned top spot in the company's 2019 national sales rankings for achieving 220% against annual sales target*\\\".\\n\\nThe second statement is much more informative and tells the audience not only what the achievement was, but also why it was earned. This is a good example of how you can use context to ensure your descriptions are quantified, specific, and informative.\\n\\nIn general, a good description will address three informational goals:\\n\\n* A **challenge** or problem to be solved. This doesn't always need to be explicitly stated. For example, in the second statement in quotes above, the problem is implied - to meet and exceed sales goals and rank high as possible on the sales charts.\\n* The **action**(s) you took to address that challenge. What did YOU do specifically. I don't care what your team or your boss did.\\n* An **outcome** that resulted as a direct result of your actions. What did your actions produce? It doesn't always need to be a monumental, earth-shattering impact, but it does need to be there.\\n\\n# #3 Failing to curate your resume to your targeted role\\n\\nIf you were to walk into your local car dealership looking for an off-road vehicle for travelling through muddy terrain and the salesperson tries to sell you on a two-door Volkswagen beetle, you'd think they weren't very good at their job.\\n\\nSo why would you do that to a prospective employer? By submitting a resume for a role it wasn't written for, you're demonstrating one of two things:\\n\\n* You don't understand the requirements of role you're applying for, OR\\n* You're too lazy to tailor your resume to the role.\\n\\nBoth of these are equally bad and often result in being ignored by the company.\\n\\n**How do you tailor your resume to the job?**\\n\\n* Step 1: Read the job posting carefully. Identify what they're looking for in terms of experience/responsibilities, skills, licenses/certifications, and education.\\n* Step 2: Put yourself in the recruiter's shoes. How quickly can you identify any given prerequisite from the job advertisement on your resume? Is it easily identifiable or do you need to dig in for several moments to find it?\\n* Step 3: Does the language used in your resume match that in the job description? Are you using the same terms?\\n\\nExample 1: Company A is requesting at least 5 years of experience doing X.  Your summary (if you include one) would begin by saying 'X Professional with 5+ years of experience in X'.\\n\\nExample 2: Company B is requesting CPR, AED, ACLS, and PALS certifications. You would include a section labelled as 'Certifications' and list these (exactly as they're presented in the ad).\\n\\n# DON'T DO THIS\\n\\n* Copy and paste the job description into your resume - it's very easy to spot and is disingenuous.\\n* Lie and/or embellish your accomplishments. You may get away with it, but if a clever hiring manager puts you on the spot, it'll be obvious (In my experience as a recruiter, I was privy to many of these situations during interviews and it doesn't look good - trust me).\\n\\nI hope you guys find this useful!\"", "title": "Biggest mistakes that impact your resume's performance and how to fix them", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/tq061t/biggest_mistakes_that_impact_your_resumes/"}, {"author": "StrikingStreet3083", "created_utc": 1700191748.0, "link_flair_template_id": "3d212a9a-f5cb-11ec-acef-1adb3b338801", "link_flair_text": "I need feedback - Asia ", "num_comments": 538, "post_id": "17x5wyw", "score": 1440, "subreddit": "resumes", "text": "\"I am looking for internship to build my resume but no response this I my resume need feedback I am doing wrong\"", "title": "Need feedback 200+ jobs applied 0 responses", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "url": "https://i.redd.it/3ga5b5vyut0c1.jpg"}, {"author": "McRibbitt", "created_utc": 1688760607.0, "link_flair_template_id": "68336c78-16bb-11ed-81ea-020fc04d0e6d", "link_flair_text": "Success Story", "num_comments": 122, "post_id": "14thyth", "score": 1331, "subreddit": "resumes", "text": "\"\"", "title": "This resume gave me a $74,000 salary job, almost doubling my salary", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "url": "https://i.redd.it/mwhkbad6olab1.jpg"}, {"author": "Capable-229", "created_utc": 1698694631.0, "link_flair_template_id": "0348e2a0-5e50-11e5-8349-128d650819bd", "link_flair_text": "Other", "num_comments": 307, "post_id": "17k1mwb", "score": 1310, "subreddit": "resumes", "text": "\"I graduated a few years ago from Harvard College, and recently left my position at a tech startup (amicably).

Even if it's not specific advice for me, I think it's helpful to open the dialogue. From my understanding, it seems that there are two main mentalities (and others in the middle). Either choose quality or quantity when applying or some of both. I find myself doing both usually -- investing time into tailoring a resume for dream positions and \\\"easy applying\\\" to others. To be picky is a luxury -- I realize this. But it's also nice to confirm that 100+ apps aren't all being tailored, despite what I see people advise others to do. There's really no harm in sending out resumes en masse, since getting through to offer seems so unpredictable anyway. I used to feel like maybe I wasn't trying hard enough if I didn't tailor my resumes. But now my personal takeaway is not to feel guilty no matter what approach I take.\"", "title": "How are people applying to 100+ jobs?", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1480943/how_are_people_applying_to_100_jobs/"}, {"author": "ExecutiveDrafts", "created_utc": 1570463463.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 32, "post_id": "delb19", "score": 506, "subreddit": "resumes", "text": "\"Hello all,\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt's been a while since I've made a stand-alone post to address some things I see happening in the job-searching and resume writing world, so I thought I'd pop in with a post just for Reddit.  There's no website link, there's no pitch to our services, it's just a list of things you can think about and act on to improve your resume and job searching strategies. I hope some folks find it helpful as we move into a tricky part of the year.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* As I mentioned, this is a tricky part of the year for a job transition. Most people have until just after Thanksgiving to get a job offer. After that, things slow to a crawl. Folks are out of the office, spending time with their families, and companies are waiting to approve head count after reviewing their quarterly and annual earnings.  These things put together means very little hiring happens. To compound it, many people want to \\\"hold off\\\" on the job search so they can enjoy the holidays. What ends up happening? January is a hiring fiesta and people scramble to prepare their resumes once they return to work and realize they're not so happy with their jobs.  This means you should either make a mad rush to get hired right now, or you should start updating your resume and job searching approach in preparation for the January rush.  If you're prepared now, you will be one step ahead of people when the new year hits.\\n* One of the most common resume mistakes I see is when people aren't thinking about how their resume looks to a person trying to hire them.  This sounds simple, but clearly presents challenges to people.  I am currently hiring an administrative position at Executive Drafts, and I've had well over 400 applications in only a few weeks.  Of those 400 applications, I'd say over half of them make no sense to me whatsoever (their careers are completely unrelated, they seem grossly overqualified, and/or they make no attempt at explaining to me the reason for their transition or interest, either in the summary or a cover letter).  It baffles me that someone with a Ph.D. or C-level experience would apply to an administrative assistant position at my company without even giving a slight reason for the obvious mismatch, and so those people are not going to get a callback.  If you are making a career transition, or if you're looking to take a lateral or downward step in your career, you need to be careful how you phrase things, specific about your job titles, and provide a brief but tactful explanation. In short, your story needs to make sense, because there's always another resume behind yours and we don't have time to call everyone and figure out what's going on with their career aspirations.\\n* Any decent job gets a ton of applications, which means you need to get the right tools in place (Resume, LinkedIn, etc.) and then you need to run the numbers.  It is very hard to go after one specific job and get it, and it's very hard to go after 100 jobs with a crappy resume and get anything at all. The sweet spot is in the middle: Get the right tools, then keep your activity levels high.  I know this can vary based on your urgency, your specific career, etc., but I think anyone serious about getting a new job should aim for around 10-15 applications a week. This ensures you can give each one proper care (making small revisions from job to job, for example). People who apply to 2 jobs a week, as well as those applying to 50+, are both showing different bad habits with the same disappointing outlook.\\n* Standing out isn't an effective strategy. So many of our clients ask how they can stand out better to recruiters. One thing I've learned over and over again is that recruiters aren't stupid and they don't fall for tricks. A lavender scented resume with glitter stands out, but isn't likely to get you hired.  Extensive graphical design elements aren't effective in the long run.  Eye-popping catch phrases don't work.  Mostly, we're looking to filter out obviously unqualified folks, and then we're hoping to find someone who seems like they understand how to write professionally, they've done the kind of work we're looking for, and they \\\"fit in\\\".  I wish the bad advice wouldn't circulate as often as it does, but maybe this is why our clients end up with an advantage.  You are far better off showing yourself as a strong match for the job than finding a way to \\\"stand out\\\".\\n* People are often frustrated when transitioning careers because they're so sure they can do the job, and they just need an employer to take a chance on them.  In a perfect world with plenty of opportunity, this sounds totally fair.  However, employers aren't looking to be mean and deny you an opportunity. Rather, it's a simple matter of \\\"Do I take this person, who has worked as a server for six years and wants to be a customer success agent, or do I take this person, who has worked in customer service for six years and customer success for two?\\\"  Employers can usually find people who have already done the job they're hiring for.  This is where networking helps. This is where freelancing or contract work helps. This is where temp services can be helpful.  Sometimes, it's even a good strategy to take a position that might pay less if it offers you a doorway into a new career path. You can always re-evaluate in 12 months and apply for a role at the same company or an entirely different one, now that you have experience.  I meet so many people who say \\\"I really don't want to take a lateral move.\\\" Yeah, nobody does. But sometimes that can be the best decision you've ever made.  I know so many people who want to transition out of sales roles and into something else in the corporate world, but are afraid of losing a few thousand dollars a year. Commission jobs tend to pay well, and if you want to give up that stressful sales quota and work as a project manager, it's probably a good idea to take even money to re-establish your experience.\\n* Let's talk about something a little less heady: Skills sections. I would say the average person has a skills section on his resume, but the average person probably doesn't need one. Highly technical positions benefit from a \\\"Technical Skills\\\" section. However, many resumes would be better off simply mentioning those skills within the body of the resume. That lets you talk about your skills in context.  To add to the problem, many skills sections come off as very weak, using low-level soft skills that act as filler.  I see many skills sections with things like \\\"problem solving\\\", \\\"critical thinking\\\", \\\"beginner german\\\", etc.  None of those skills, when said without any context, are likely to get you hired.  Instead, they drag the resume down.  Skills sections are great if you feel your professional overview could benefit from a single grid of say, 12 keywords that you know are highly sought-after and searched for (IT guys, software developers, obviously this is very relevant to you).  But project managers, people who work in operations and only have a few software applications they need to know, and other such professions can easily mention a couple of keywords in their summary and the rest within the body of the resume itself.  Simply put, ask yourself if your skills section really adds meat to your resume, or if it just feels like extra fluff.\\n* Lastly, let's talk about fluff in general.  I read bloated resumes every single day.  I'm wordy and often need to review my writing to cut it down to something shorter and easier to consume (this post is living proof).  When people try to write something impressive, they use far more words and phrases than they need.  They say things like 'Successfully handled in-bound calls for a law firm' when there was really no point in using the word \\\"Successfully\\\".  They try to make their college job at burger king sound like a master class in multi-tasking and customer service, when really it's just a job that helped you pay the bills in college, and employers have no problem with accepting it for what it is.  Most resumes should be shorter. Most should be very plainly written, more direct, and stick to quickly relaying what kind of tasks you did, what kind of results you achieved, how you approached specific problems or projects, and what skills and abilities you picked up along the way.  When you write a resume this way, and when you write it so that you're only offering a prospective employer the info he needs to bring you in for an interview, you drastically increase the chances your resume will get read, and the chances of your message getting through to them.  Long resumes with extra sections, nonsense soft skills and excessive detail are killing your chances of success.\\n\\nI hope everyone's off to a productive week in their job search.  I'll be quite active on Reddit this week, weighing in on as many resumes as I can, and I'm happy to take questions here, via PM, or anywhere else we see fit.  You guys are all here to either offer help (thank you so much!) or ask for help (congratulations, you came to the right place).  So let's help as many people as we can get job-ready so they can move on with their careers.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nJeremy\\n\\nExecutive Drafts\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Redditor caught a typo and alerted me.

To be honest I was not the brightest student, but try my very best to learn.  I have struggled to find a job upon graduation and had no luck for about 3 months. Been getting denials due to my GPA and that is where it hit me the most. I know in reality that GPA was not important once you gain experience but as a recent grad it was my mentality at that time. I was applying to lower end jobs such as a technician to just gain experience and work my way up. Plus the pandemic slowed down the hiring process.\\n\\nBut anyways it was a struggle but I try to keep my mentality positive and kept applying, change up the resume for different job postings, etc. Eventually got a call for interview and the process took about two weeks and now I am in Houston,TX working as a NASA Contractor (Jacobs). I have been looking into space industry for awhile and my wish was fulfilled.\\n\\nThe point of this is to not brag, that I work for NASA. I want to tell all you redditors (if that make sense lol) that this can happen to anyone. Cause in the end, there is always a reason why it happen. Who knows you might get a call you would not expect and you will be glad that it happen. I was offered a position in Raytheon,Blue Origin, and Northrop but was not selected in case you don't know. My advice is to just keep applying and change up your resume based on the job posting. Keep moving forward and be positive don't let negativity get to you, whether it is about not being selected, not getting calls, etc. I have been in your route before and am pretty sure everybody else has been. It will be a struggle at first but will be worth in the end because you never know where you will end up.\\n\\nResume that landed the job: [https://imgur.com/TOi7Sqk](https://imgur.com/TOi7Sqk)\\n\\nPlease excuse any grammar or spelling errors.\\n\\nI know this is not the best place to post but I figured I share it with everyone as it can apply to them.
