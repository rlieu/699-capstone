Today the Admins reached out a second time about reopening the subreddit, this time with more urgency. I have been reluctant to do anything as I was not the founder of this subreddit and I didn't want to overstep. I was also torn regarding the issue facing Reddit. Then I received a direct message from the Admins that I had to respond too or else a new Mod would take over. On the one hand I completely am against the API changes. But on the other hand this subreddit provides the community with a valuable function. Many people come here looking for help on making a career change or even finding a new job. Many people come here desperate because for most of us we cannot be without work for too long. \\n\\nSo going forward the Subreddit is back open.

This got worse with age. 10 years of professional therapy, couseling, and three rounds of job coaching (with different coaches) have not made this better. I tried to exercise, do\\u00a0breath-work, rest well, do yoga, masturbate, you name it, in the mornings of those job interviews to take the edge off and feel more at ease. It's safe to say (and extremely disappointing): nothing worked. No matter the amount of times I reviewed my career achievements, pat myself on the back, worked so hard on my self-esteem, it's like this trauma never ends. It's like once I hear about getting an interview with a new company, I am glad for 2 seconds, and then revert to a child-like state (although I don't even think this is the right term, a child might not be so terrified of this), or a dumbfounded state where I lose all confidence and ability to believe in myself. \\n\\nI prepare thoroughly for interviews, over the past year(s) I've created as many as 100 different, real-life scenarios for whatever they might ask, research the employers, read everything I can, ask around for other people's experiences with that company...you name it. When I get on Zoom (or in the room), it's like my insides blow up and I simply cannot feel safe, at peace, or at ease within myself. I did rehearsals with my coaches and some friends, but the thing is I seem to always be less anxious in those (since I trust those people I am.not able to replicate the real world interview settings) so they tell me I sound great and confident. Finally, the advice \\\"be yourself\\\" gets the worst of me. I feel that I cannot sound prepared, interesting, assertive, and relaxed all the while AND remember everything I want to say. This baffles me, because I am a relatively good public speaker and if I make a speech for instance, or do a talk in front of an audience, I am able to improvise my way out of forgetfulness or painful \\\"uhmmm's\\\".\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\nOn Tuesday I am invited to interview for a big company, in a VP role. It's laughable, because I don't understand why they called me. I believe (genuinely) that I must have tricked them. Some of you might come to tell me that this is trauma, or impostor syndrome. I know people who have impostor syndrome. They are doing better. I, instead, feel cursed, and have seen the effects of this panic and fear in action, and how they sabotaged some seemingly great opportunities.\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\nI am afraid of the interviewer,\\u00a0and that advice to picture them naked or \\\"just a normal person\\\" doesn't move me. I, interestingly, do not have this fear if I, say, interview with a potential client in freelancing.

(My company doesn't give out \\\"officer\\\" titles) I have 15 years of experience in accounting. I loved my job when I first started, it is remote, no one watches what you do, there are deadlines, and no one cared if you take a random Tuesday off with no notice, just get things done by the deadline, and you are golden. It started about 4 months ago, the owner started to ask me about urgent things last minute, and most these urgent things had something to do with me. Like \\\"I'm about to enter a meeting with a client and need xyz reports right now.\\\" I would do it, but ask the office assistant/AP person when the meeting was scheduled, just to find out that he knew about the meeting for weeks and could have asked me without such tight time limits. Lots of examples like that. Lots if texts at 7am and 8/9pm asking for similar things.\\n\\nThen he started asking me to do these really meaningless tasks that make the whole process harder and more complicated if I'm involved. Like for instance, he will tell me to call a client and ask why they haven't paid an invoice(even if it isn't due yet). I informed him I have an automated system in place where everyone gets an email from me 5 days before an invoice is due, reminding them of the balance, due date approaching, and asking if there are issues with the invoice that would cause them to not pay. Then another one goes out the day after it's late. He said I need to be texting and calling them regularly and I need to update him weekly. Here is the thing, if I call them, they normally always have a reason for not paying, but the company is in the construction industry and the customers have very advanced reasons for not paying something. I am not on the job site, and even if I was I wouldn't know what I am looking at, and when I talk to these people it's clear I have no understanding of their questions and just am taking notes down for the owner of the company and also the project manager of their project. And they will talk for up to an hour about their questions because I had no understanding so they'd have to explain really \\\"simple\\\" things to me for me to even take real notes. Then I will call the owner to update him, read back my notes. Then he will say \\\"oh call them back and tell them they are wrong.\\\" And I'm like.... I can't do that, I don\\u2019t understand any of this, they want to talk to you or the PM, someone needs to explain why they are wrong. I never should call them, only the PM or owner understands their questions. I've become a glorified middle man. This has somehow become a large part of my job, and same deal, it's an \\\"emergency\\\" that this needs to happen all the time with no notice. Now I find myself checking my email and texts for messages from the owner 6am-9pm is when he will contact me about these \\\"emergencies\\\" and then I get embarrassed for not knowing I should have called someone about an invoice. There are so many of these middle man things, where it would take nearly no time for him, and really is not my job. \\n\\nMost recently I was in a meeting with the owner and CPA. The owner had reached out to the person who used to have my job, had them go over the year end numbers and come up with a standard financial report. They said our Net profit was 69k. The owner did not tell me he had asked them to do the report too. He also asked me to do it. I came up with 1.4m in net profit. In the meeting with the CPA he revealed he asked the old controller and she got to a different number than me and obviously she was right. The CPA looked shocked and could tell how awkward I felt, and said that he had already reviewed our books before the meeting and that I was correct, not her. Right after this meeting I felt good and thought things would change and I'd get respect. I was wrong. He sent me a link for a seminar coming up for people considering being accountants in the construction industry and asked if he should reserve a spot for me. Exactly zero times since working here has he found me to make an accounting error, WTF.\\n\\nI'd like to continue aspects of my job, the ones I was originally hired for. Invoicing the clients (our invoices are not standard, they are very time intensive and require an insane amount of back up information) and to keep the accounting books clean and accurate. No more client contact, no more administrative work, I just want to be a 1099. I'm going to send him a letter today explaining this, and offering to do this for half my pay. (Which I think is a steal) I can do all of this in about 40/44 hours a month. These are the things the old controller also did exclusively, except she took way longer to do them because she'd have to go back and fix her errors which is very time consuming for the type of invoicing we use. \\n\\nI'm highly anticipating him saying no, giving me a very emotional call and plead to not do this, and saying if I do, then I'll need to stay for months to train a new person. I feel terrible and like I'm burning a bridge which will destroy my resume. \\n\\nI also work for my husband's law firm and we are currently building a large complicated home 3 hour away, I'm going to need to be at our job site frequently and can't deal with last minute emergencies. The owner knows all of this, he even knows we are planning on having a baby soon, this is unreasonable.

I've been here for almost 5 years. It's been quite the journey. I've got this incredible tech lead who's been a mentor to me, and I swear, I learn something new from him every single day. I've tackled big, complex projects and managed to deliver each time. Funny thing is, I didn't go through formal training for this gig; everything I know, I've picked up through hands-on experience and, of course, good ol' Google.\\n\\nSo, I recently updated my LinkedIn to reflect my current role as a Data Engineer and recruiters started flooding my inbox with messages. Now, here's where I'm torn. I actually enjoy what I do right now, plus having such an amazing mentor is priceless. But on the other hand  I know I'm underpaid for the work I do, and I'm currently in the process of buying a house alone, having a stable job seems like a smart move.\\n\\nThe thing is, I'm not sure if I'm ready to take the leap just yet.

This is a throwaway account.  \\nBasically, physics Ph.D. applications didn't go exactly as planned. I'll try to be vague, but I attend a public school ranked in the top 50 physics universities in the U.S., towards the upper end. I personally felt that I worked very hard in undergrad, I studied a lot and kept my GPA right around my goal of a 3.8, worked as an undergrad researcher since the beginning of my sophomore year which resulted in some presentations at my university, and spent two summers at a national lab where I was published in a sub-journal (if that's the right term) of a very well known journal, as well as some other miscellaneous conference papers/abstracts. My recommenders knew me well and were, as far as I know, very complimentary. I must note that I did not take the general or physics GRE. However, all that apparently was not enough. When applying to Ph.D.s, I reapplied to my home institution and the rest were applications to schools in the top 15 just hoping one would stick. I was accepted to my home institution, but rejected from all other schools. I was especially disappointed in a rejection from a public school in the top 10 for my chosen subfield, since I was able to tour a lab there and meet the current grad students. I don't want to make any excuses for myself, but I think I was just unaware how well qualified my competition was, and how hard it is to break into these schools when coming from outside the top 15. The smartest kid in my graduating class was rejected from most of the the top schools he applied to as well, and he is genuinely the smartest person I've ever met, even more so than the people I know who ended up going to top 10s for undergrad. All this is making me question what to do next. I'll try to say this without sounding arrogant, but I feel like a very well rounded person, in that I have many hobbies, friends, and things outside of physics that make me who I am, but all these rejections are for the first time in my life making me question how far I can make it. It's just weird as well since none of the individual rejections hit me hard, if it all, they were all just kind of like \\\"damn another one\\\", it's just the totality of them all is getting to me.  \\nThe thing is, I really don't NEED to go to a great school to get the jobs I want in industry or the government. As of now, I want to continue with physics research as a career, but I certainly don't want to work as a professor or somewhere that requires me going to a top 15 school. I think the thing is I'm very competitive and wanted to be among \\\"the best\\\" at what I do, and this process is making me feel as if I'm being told I'm not, and looking at these grad admissions forums and seeing other's results are certainly not helping.  \\nMy dream career is working as a physics or applied physics researcher in industry. But after this process, I'm questioning it. Doing research these past few years has taught me that most of the enjoyment I get from research is the actual process, i.e., the programming (especially ML), experimentation, etc., rather than the results at the end. Granted, my research has been in topics I'm not too into, but it has opened my eye to other career paths like data science, engineering, etc. Plus, I'm really not sure if I want to spend another 4+ years in my college town. I really want to enjoy my early-mid 20s, and I'm not sure how many opportunities I'll have to do that in my college town.  \\nThis is all to say, I'm basically at a crossroads here and am unsure of what to do. I'm definitely not going to wait a year and reapply with a GRE score, since I'm not sure that would change anything. I've decided I'm going to take the offer at my school, but I'm strongly considering mastering out. I just don't know how marketable my physics masters would be to physics adjacent jobs like the ones I've mentioned. I also could commit and see if I can just do my Ph.D. as fast as possible, maybe <5 years if I'm lucky. I think I'm just looking for guidance or seeing what other people have done in circumstances similar to mine. It's just a little dejecting when my friends are are getting into good masters programs, finding good jobs, and I feel as if I under-performed, even though I should probably be thankful I made it into a relatively high ranked Ph.D. program at all.

By the time I would start my master's program, I\\u2019ll have 8 months of full-time work experience.  \\n\\\\- I've been accepted into the MEng program at UC Berkeley, focusing on Mechanical Engineering in Robotics. Although I've received some funding, the exact amount is still unknown, which makes the cost a significant consideration.  \\nI'm torn between two paths:  \\n\\\\- Pursue the MEng at Berkeley: This option is financially more challenging, but it could potentially open doors in the Bay Area, especially given the program's prestige and location. I\\u2019d be leaving my current job with just 8 months of experience, and after graduating, I would try to find a full-time role in the Bay Area, leveraging the OPT.  \\n\\\\- Defer the MEng program: If possible, I could defer my admission, allowing me to save more money and be in a better position to comfortably afford the degree. This would also give me more time to gain additional work experience before pursuing the master's, possibly making it easier to find a job in the Bay Area afterward.  \\nGiven these options, I'm looking for advice on:  \\n\\\\- The value of the MEng from Berkeley, especially in the field of robotics.  \\n\\\\- The impact of having only 8 months of full-time work experience before pursuing a master's.  \\n\\\\- The financial aspect of pursuing an MEng, considering the unknown total funding amount.  \\n\\\\- The feasibility and potential benefits of deferring the program to improve my financial and professional standing.  \\n\\n\\nAny insights, experiences, or advice would be greatly appreciated to help me navigate this decision.  \\nThank you in advance\"", "title": "Pursuing MEng at Berkeley vs. Continuing Work", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bg0uya/pursuing_meng_at_berkeley_vs_continuing_work/"}, {"author": "RealAd1811", "created_utc": 1710545191.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 10, "post_id": "1bfrqee", "score": 7, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"Long story short, I\\u2019m in customer service and had an order come in for 20 KG of material.

I quit after the company was shrinking due to new competition and covid.  \\nStudied mechaical engineering for 3,5 years, which i finished recently.  \\nWithin those 3,5 years i had an internship at a small sustainability-focused engineering office. I learned a lot about the engineers role in forming a more sustainable future, to make our precious little planet last a little longer.

They have a very scientific, no/low bullshit approach to sustainability and operate in various industries. I enjoy working with a creative and somewhat puristic motivation with mutuals. However the current impact on the large industries is not that big and future impact is always unsure. Every project almost feels hypothetical, or like a low odds gamble.  \\nOffer 2 --- \\\"Big automotive manufacturer Big OEM You see their cars every day\\\" company  \\nStongly efficiency/economics-focused. Basically the ones we tried to change at my internship. The nature of their approach is not as attractive to me. However my direct industry impact would be huge compared to Offer 1. At the job interview it also seemed like they have some interest in my sustainabilty knowledge. But these people also tend to just say whatever sounds good.  \\nPay is no point in this discussion. 2 pays better than 1, but both are good enough to make me perfectly happy, so this matter can be excluded.  \\nto destill it down:  \\nIn the battle for sustainability, should i join the front, or should i trojan-horse that shit?

Pays well enough to me is hopefully cracking six figures within five or so years.\\n\\nSome options I\\u2019ve considered are moving back home to work and save on rent and trying to self-teach or bootcamp CS or programming (or maybe look into a degree), or maybe stick out law school and try to leverage the JD into Compliance or HR. I like to be creative and always learn new things and solve puzzles which makes programming intriguing to me, no STEM or CS background though.

I just know I got a lot of time but I\\u2019m ready to make a change. I also think my self confidence is bad. Because I\\u2019ve never achieved anything difficult.\\n\\n#1 Finance Degree: I have a passion for investing. Specifically stocks and ETFs and real estate investing but I think I like stocks a bit more. I also like going on Reddit and answering peoples budgeting questions and would love to help tell someone how to budget and invest. I also would like to look professional and wear a suit and be organized. I did bad in math in high school but it\\u2019s probably because I goofed off with my friends and it was boring to me and I just couldn\\u2019t focus. But I have no idea how good I would do in the math portion of things because I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m confident in myself to pass the math part of finance. But maybe I can learn basic investment equations if I put my mind to it and really get into a focused state. I think some tax loopholes to learn about would be cool as well. Everything else in finance that I didn\\u2019t mention I couldn\\u2019t really care about. I like how you can have high income potential as well. But I am not confident in starting my own financial business. I think I\\u2019d stick to working for a small company and work my way up to a large firm. But I am uncertain about how good of a job I can get after college and since it\\u2019s competitive I don\\u2019t know how likely I am to get accepted into a large firm with experience. But my uncle is in financial and own his own small financial business so he can guide me maybe. But I also know finance people usually work long hours and I hate getting up early but if it\\u2019s something I like I will get up early for it. I also don\\u2019t know if I would be able to handle 16 hour days either but I could handle 11.\\n\\n#2 Pilot \\nI like this one because I think flying jets is cool. Not the Air Force kind. But I would like to be a airline pilot or a private jet pilot. I also know this a is a great paying field depending on what job you pick in it. But many people have said that it takes a long time to become one and others have gotten in fast. Also a lot of people say don\\u2019t go in if your just in for the money. There\\u2019s also a massive pilot shortage and it\\u2019s causing pilots to be paid more. I went for a discovery flight one time and enjoyed it I also landed the plane perfectly but the experienced guy next to me did all the speed controlling and all I did was control the direction and the stick. I don\\u2019t know if being a pilot will be boring but from what I see it sounds like a awesome job. I think  it\\u2019s cool to travel around and stay for a little and experience the area and get up the next day and fly out. I like how professional pilots are and I remember seeing them in the airport and thinking man it looks so cool being a pilot. I also love going on planes whenever I go on one.I have seen people say go hard it is to get into delta  and the major airlines that pay more but if you work hard or get enough hours in you can really make a lot . As far as I\\u2019ve seen the more flight hours you have the better. And I would also be going to college because the major airlines prefer a degree in aviation but used to require a degree. But since there a shortage and demand for pilots it\\u2019s easier to get in. Some people make the process sound miserable by saying you can loose your job easily if something goes wrong medically because since your responsible for all passengers you cannot have anything wrong to interfere with your flying. But some people can get a job with there aviation degree in something else and it doesn\\u2019t just have to a pilot as a backup.you do have to pass a medical exam so that is why. I also don\\u2019t know if I can memorize the controls. But maybe I can but I think once I start doing I I think I may like I a lot. When I went go the discovery flight I was thinking It would be scary and I didn\\u2019t know how I was going to figure out all the controls. I also thought it would be hard to control the plane but it wasn\\u2019t bad after all and was pretty fun. I also think it\\u2019s a badass job to be a airline pilot. The last thing I don\\u2019t like about it is that how much math you have to do and I don\\u2019t know if I would get bored learning about cockpit controls. I also don\\u2019t know much of a quick thinker you have to be to calculate everything. In the air.

Many thanks!\\n\\n\\n\\nHi all,\\n\\n  \\nI am a contemporary sculptor and have an MA in molecular biology (2012, previous career) and an MFA (2018, current job). Was doing wedding photography in between. I've been working hard to become a full-time artist since I graduated.\\n\\n  \\nI have a gallery representation in my city. It's promising but new and small, focusing on growing, running through different artists, and fine-tuning his stable niche at this moment. I realize I have to start to broaden my network beyond my city myself. I started to find stable remote job opportunities, so it would be easier for me to go to shows, and openings that I am part of, and keep my art practice going and doing out-of-state artist residencies in person. Studio space is expensive. Plus, sometimes people just don't pay on time, exp there is a hotel chain that pays me 4 months later than their promised deadline.\\n\\n  \\nAfter some research earlier last year, I chose UX design, based on my interests and background, and some articles say it should still be in high demand within the following 5-10 years. I just started my UX design boot camp at the end of January this year and realized how brutal and low the entry-level salary is. I made about 30K in art last year. The lowest range of my boot camp graduates last year falls into the same range.\\n\\n  \\nUnfortunately, I also got divorced last year. My ex generated fake documents and took everything. We are in a family lawsuit now. So even though I live in low-income housing and costs down tremendously. It's hard to control my monthly expenses.\\n\\n  \\nI guess my question is, I feel in the long run UX and trying to get into tech I have a higher possibility that I can have a smoother and more stable life while I grow as an artist. But seeing how saturated it is, I started to doubt it. Maybe it will be a better choice for me to try to find/ create remote art teaching jobs etc. I have some friends who work in tech but also try hard to turn their side hustle in a completely different creative field into their day job. They seem to balance well but they all work in tech for more than 10-15 years. But for me, having two careers seems impossible in terms of my ability and age.\\n\\n  \\nAny suggestions to help me think things more rationally would be super helpful! Many thanks.  \\nPs.

The pay is around 75K with a potential 10% bonus. The job looks interesting (better title than the previous one but  same pay) but is one hour driving from my home (Miami to FLL) with no traffic and at least 4 days in person (uggg). I honestly don't think I could do the commute everyday since I hate driving and we considered renting a place in FLL for the week and spending the weekend in Miami (we own here). I countered asking for 95k (originally told them was looking for 100k) but they said no. It s a manager role so I think the pay is not great but the company looks good with growth potential. \\n\\nHowever, my husband works in Miami so we would potentially not see each other during the week and even a shitty place in FLL to crash during the week is expensive. \\n\\nTHE ISSUE: I am waiting to hear back from another job (100k base, remote, and a DREAM, working in research I believe is more beneficial for society). I made it to final round and really, really want it. I reached out asking for an update and they said \\\"Thank you for following up. We are interested and appreciate that you have other things to consider.  Please allow us until next week for the final decision.\\\"  \\n\\nHowever, the current offer wants an answer by tomorrow Friday (I officially got the offer today, Thursday). I asked for the weekend to review offer and speak with my husband and they said no, which I also find a little rude since during the interview process I was very understanding with rescheduling interviews and needing an answer in less than a day I found to be unusual. \\n\\n I don't really know what's best and am scared of giving up on a sure thing to maybe end up with nothing lol. Also, I have not been the most responsible in the past and want to do better and take my career more seriously. \\n\\nEveryone keeps telling the market is terrible and I should take it.

But for someone who is, if they start asking questions about our consultants roles with our clients, it can get blurry for me since I never worked directly with one of our clients.\\nI also find things very difficult since as a consulting agency with consultant fees, we cannot go after smaller clients and typically have to aim for much larger organisations (think Fortune 500) that themselves already work with much larger consulting firms such as McKinsey, BCG, PWC,Deloitte etc..\\nSo typically if they get a message from me they will either ignore or say they don\\u2019t need me at all, or that they already work with someone.\\n\\nMy current strategy consists of lies to leads about being a consultant myself and wanting to have a chat with them, which does result in a much higher response rate, but once we get to a call a real consultant has to be there with me to answer technical questions (which to me is extremely frustrating ) and then we use those leads to promote our company with our newsletter/ podcast/ events etc.. but we\\u2019ve completely cut out the direct sales approach because it just wasn\\u2019t working.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve started this role in August 2023, and so far I have not signed any consultants into a new company, I knew it was gonna be hard, I didn\\u2019t know it was gonna be near impossible.\\nI typically mainly use LinkedIn for prospecting since it\\u2019s the less invasive way of contacting our leads, maybe I should focus on cold calls?\\n\\nMy personal opinion is that my company does not have enough recognition to be focusing on sales just yet and should be focusing branding, marketing and networking as opposed to full ok sales calls/messages. But that\\u2019s just me, maybe I\\u2019m trying to justify my poor performance on the industry but I want some unfiltered external advice.\\nI ask because I\\u2019ve decided that I want to quit this job, but so far the only offers I\\u2019ve gotten are in Sdr positions, albeit in very different industries and in companies with a more organised sales team.

Get specific! E.g., \\u2018my kid staying home sick from daycare 99.9% of the time\\u2019 is better than \\u2018parenting.\\u2019\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThen, decide what percent of your total stress each item is causing. For example, if you divide 100 percentage points among these stressors, how much does each one take up? So, for example, perhaps your constantly sick kid is causing 30% of your total stress.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIf you have a lot of items, I find it helpful to tally up some high-level categories. For example, \\u201cwork\\u201d and \\u201clife\\u201d. When I did this, I discovered work accounted for 60% of my total stress, which was a helpful insight in and of itself!\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThen, draw a good ole fashioned pie chart so you can visualize your most significant stressors at the moment. If you have too many to fit nicely in a pie chart, you can skip it and just rank order them in a list\\u2026 but it\\u2019s Pi Day, so it\\u2019s worth a shot.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nLast step: Answer the question, on an average day in the past week, on a scale of 0 to 10, how high is my stress right now? (Zero being not stressed at all and 10 being the worst stress possible).

I had to keep budget in mind, consult with people, reach out to distributors,  and etc. \\n\\n I'm just basically a restuarant manager in NYC  for really big restaurant groups. my normal day to day duties involve things like doing schedules for like 50+ people, overseeing day-day operations, keeping guests happy, ordering goods, keeping the owners happy, handling our events schedule, team building, and doing lots of administrative work on the side when im not working the floor to boost sales or keep customers happy.\\n\\nI've also been a freelance/contract photographer for the last 8 years, which I doubt counts whatsoever, but I've basically overseen/managed bigger projects/campaigns in regards to my photography. From drafting concepts for clients, to reaching out to models/stylists/designers/assistants/Hair+Makeup/Creative-Directors for specific projects, to researching locations, analyzing work from similar brand projects, managing big teams during long term campaigns, managing budget/costs, making sure everything is organized well and scheduled correctly for people, dealing with any issues that come up, and delivering an end result for paying clients. \\n\\n\\nI've been really looking to switch into a more operations or large scale management role outside of the hospitality industry but have trouble getting even entry level jobs as a project coordinator or some junior level to gain more direct experience, as my resume is moreso restaurant management/operations experience and managing other places (like at a big art gallery and also as the operations manager at a ferry company in nyc).\\n\\nIs there even a point to trying to pursue the PMP certification without that relevant project mgmt job Or Is my experience enough?

I'm wondering if I should be honest in my exit interview or not. I marked personal reasons for my reason for leaving the job because over time the job has changed me. I definitely went into the job with high hopes, but now I look like the stardew valley character before they go to the farm. \\n\\nThe points that I think lead me to feeling I had to leave were: \\n\\n1. Lack of communication about my job. They did not disclose to me that I'd have to do yearly public speaking meetings. I am not a good public speaker and was caught off guard when I had to suddenly do it. I would've preferred time to prepare myself for it. \\n\\n2. Lack of training set me up to fail. In my department, they said we would be doing a job rotation so that everyone would have a back up or coverage for when they'd take vacations. On the surface, this sounds like a good idea but over time as I learned my new position I realized I was forgetting everything about my old one. \\n\\nWhen it comes to being set up to fail, the reason I felt this way is I had a vacation scheduled, months in advance to the point I had to wait for the vacation time to be scheduled to apply for it. And the time when we were doing the job switch, just so happened to be during my vacation. So I had less training than everyone else and a gap between when I started and when my training ended. So I did not retain the information I was learning very well. \\n\\nMy boss also told me late that training was my responsibility and I should've started at the same time as everyone else did, and it was bad that I hadn't started a week prior to when I did. I have only ever worked in retail and my family's small business, so I did not know about this expectation. \\nSo in the end, I had 2 weeks less training than everyone else, and my boss put a lot of pressure on me to do better when I didn't have the resources to. \\n\\n3. Office Politics. Office politics really pushed me over the edge when I learned about then. My boss confronted me in my cubicle about having too many piles of paper on my desk (it was only 3) I tried to explain to her the system I was making with the piles, she interrupted and raised her voice at me while giving me an ultimatum, and I had an anxiety attack as soon as she walked away. \\n\\nMy boss knows I have diagnosed anxiety and that cubicles have been a hard adjustment for me because I'm anxious about being perceived. \\n\\nWhat makes this worse, is in our next 1on1 during my performance review, she decided to explain Office politics to me and explained its very petty. Who on earth wants to be a part of that? Then she socialized with me, in my opinion, as an attempt to raise rapport after expressing to me that I've become unapproachable and I need to socialize with the team more. \\n\\n4. Favoritism of certain people on the team made it blatantly obvious to me I could not go to my superior if I had an issue with someone else. I felt I had lack of resources compared to other favorite team members and it made it harder to socialize with them in the end. \\n\\n- \\n\\nShould I be honest about these things?

I've been spending the last year trying to fix that and start building up an e-fund again, but it hasn't been easy and I've only managed to put away about $3k-$4k in cash.\\n\\nThe second problem is that this is the 4th job I've had in this industry in 5 and a half years.

I did some good work with it, but never was able to quite get it to the finish line and was let go after a year.\\n\\nI've started applying to new jobs and have been told by recruiters this looks pretty bad. On the plus side, I spent over a year at every job, so I'm very confident in my experience and abilities. On the other hand, I feel like my resume makes me look like either a textbook job-hopper or someone who's incapable of holding down a job for more than a year. It also doesn't help that the 2 jobs I was let go from were my two most recent.\\n\\nIt's only been a day, but I did the math and if I bring in $0 of income, I'll be completely out of cash in just 3 weeks.

Even if the job market for my industry is great right now, in my experience, the time from submitting a full-time job application to getting an offer and starting work at said job is like 4-6 weeks *at best.*\\n\\nSo... yeah, I'm absolutely terrified I'm not going to be able to provide for my family.

It's kind of spurred me wanting to go back to school and get an engineering degree, hopefully an FAA DER and focus on the development side of things. CAD and wiring diagrams I find oddly satisfying and feel like I could do all day. So, I'm starting to feel a pivot in my career (maybe with the same company, maybe not) however, I'm not sure how to get there from here.\\n\\nMy life feels insanely busy. I'm staving off burnout as it is and have traveled far too much for my taste. I'm not afraid of work, I'll work a 40 hour work week job no problem. However I admit I've enjoyed my current gig because, despite the travel which even that has been getting better, their work life balance is unparalleled. Need to take off early second time this week to hit up an errand, go. Never been denied PTO. Optional on call days if my work is all caught up. It's one of these deals where I KNOW the grass isn't going to be greener on the other side. However, I know I could get paid a lot more for less technical work somewhere else. So I'm starting to wonder what I could do to position myself to do MORE of the SME type work. Maybe make more money. Potentially even from home.\\n\\nA couple of the DERs I've worked with do pretty much exactly that. Even though my experience qualifies me, the FAA will likely not give me the authorization without an actual degree. Or so I've been told. The fear I have from school is that first, Academia and I have never really gotten along. I struggle with homework on boring subjects and real life constantly seems to get in the way. So I could quit my current job and go to school full time, but that brings me to my second concern. Retirement. Men in my family have a nasty habit if not living long past retirement age, so I would really like to position myself to be able to retire early. But at 36, I feel like my retirement is not nearly as far along as I wish it was. I feel like my 401k has been stuck right around the $100k mark for the last 4 years. Not going up nearly as fast as I'd like despite contributing decently above minimum, just shy of maximum. So quitting and living off of the GI bill BAH doesn't feel like a smart move as it'll effectively pause my retirement growth for 4 years. \\n\\nI have a supportive wife who makes more than I do. I just really don't want to shoot myself in the foot because I feel like a DER, even after a degree and almost 15 years of aviation experience with steadily growing responsibility leading into engineering style work, is still not a guarantee. I'll be right back at being an Avionics Technician slugging away until maybe the FAA approved me for my DER just in time to start thinking about retirement way too late.\\n\\nShould I just shut up and enjoy the comfortable lot I've got in life, or aim for the more satisfying type of work I yearn for?

It also allowed me to earn/save money because after this gap year, I intended to move cities and commence university. During my first year of university (2023), my mental health started to decline. I noticed a real shift in the grades I was getting, and eventually things snowballed and now I have very much fallen behind in a lot of my subjects. I started my second year (2024) and found that things had only gotten worse for me, and it was almost embarrassing showing up to class considering how much knowledge I was lacking. My deteriorating mental state has truly stunted my capabilities. So, I made a rather last minute choice yesterday to suspend/defer my studies for a year. In 2025 I'll return to university as normal to complete my second year, and then of course I'll go on to complete the rest of my degree. I'll graduate when I'm 23. \\n\\nNow, in my mind, I think this is a smart choice.

But will this matter? Is this a black mark on my academic/education history? Does this make it seem like I have a poor work ethic? I still have massive career aspirations, however I just needed this time. Long-story short, should I be worried that this choice is going to impact my reputation, and make me less attractive to future employers?

I'm mid-level in my career, and have historically been pretty career driven. I am mid/late 30s, but completed a career change about 8 years ago, which has made me feel that I am behind where I \\\"should\\\" be in my career at this point.\\n\\nI have wanted a promotion for a while now, and have put in the work to go above and beyond to gain a promotion over the last year / year and a half. I finally was promoted in late Nov (2023). However, I'm considering stepping back into my old role at this point for a number of reasons, outline below:\\n\\n- PAY -- I would actually get a (albeit small) pay *bump* if I were to step back. I was slightly above the mid point of my old pay grade, but am at the low point of my new pay grade, so only got a 2.25% pay increase with this promotion (even though it jumped me two salary grades). The company has a new comp philosophy that did not allow for any negotiation. This was already a raw deal from my perspective, but the real kicker / cherry on top is that this promotion actually meant that I wasn't eligible for a 4.5% company-wide comp adjustment that everyone else got on Jan 1 (because my promotion took effect in Q4, and promotions in Q4 were decided to be ineligible for the comp adjustment). *And even though* my manager told my I would get the comp adjustment when she made me the offer and I was trying to negotiate my salary (unsuccessfully due to the stringent new comp philosophy, where every position had a pre-approved hiring start rate that was non-negotiable). She didn't know at the time that I would be ineligible for the comp adjustment (I truly believe that is true), but nonetheless, she did tell me I would get it, and I didn't. So at the end of the day, if I demoted myself, I would step back into a rate that would actually be 2.25% *above* my current pay. (I've already confirmed that they would honor the 4.5% adjustment in my old role still.) Though it's not a big increase we're  talking about here, the entire situation just really, really rankles me....\\n\\n- SCHEDULE -- I'm in a supervisory role now, which means coming into the office 3 days/week instead of 2 days/week. My company recently implemented this increased RTO in Feb this year, up from 1 day/week previously. For me, this is a huge downside. I have come to very, *very* highly value work-from-home, and the shift from one day in office to three these past 6 weeks has been r-o-u-g-h. My only hesitation with this as a considering factor in whether or not to step back is that I do not believe the 2 days/week for non-supervisory roles is going to last. I believe that once they've figured out the space constraints issues of being in office, everyone will be back in 3 days/week. I just don't know when that would happen.... Could be a couple months, could be till the end of the year. Who knows. If it were till the end of the year, that might give me enough time to find another job that hopefully would be remote (I'm looking, but the market is trash right now).\\n\\n- MANAGER -- My current manager is one of the biggest reasons I'm unhappy. She didn't used to be as bad as she is now, but in the last 1.5 / 2 years, it's gotten really bad. We have a new CHRO, and I think our old CHRO kept a level of humanity to the overall culture thats since been lost. With my manager, especially lately, I feel like my opinion/thoughts never matter, it causes great anxiety to ever request any time off or schedule adjustments (I'm salaried, but even asking to leave an hour or two early for a doctor's appointment feels like pulling teeth), she is always argumentative and always has to be \\\"right\\\", never let's you have a dissenting opinion or different idea, has no respect foryour time (example: I had a meeting a few weeks back that was supposed to be an hour with her; she was 25 min late, then kept me on with her for 2.5 hours after she joined; yes youbread that right, two and a half hours). She frequently has emotional outbursts, talks trash about everyone (including us, her own direct reports, to each other), and has made myriad off-color comments related to team members' pregnancies and leaves of absence. One of our team members has actually just raised a formal complaint against her to our CHRO and CEO. If I were to demote myself, she would no longer be my direct manager. Awkwardly, one of my (new) coworkers (who is currently a level below me) would take my place. I don't have a good sense for what he'd be like as a supervisor because he's pretty new still, but I have to think he'd be better than it is now. I also think I've developed a pretty good relationship with him thus far, and think he'd be generally more chill, but I don't really know.\\n\\n\\nThese are the main reasons I want to step back. The reasons I want to stay are:\\n\\n- TITLE -- The title for my resume. As I've said, I already feel behind in my career, and I worked hard for this promotion. () I had hoped I could take this title and leverage it into another job, which I'm still trying to do but the market is suuuper crap right now. \\n\\n- THE JOB -- The job has issues and isn't still as autonomous as I'd like it to be, but it at least has *some* level of discretionary decision making to it, which I've been wanting more of for years. I usually take pride in being an excellent employee and doing good work, and kind of get excited at some of the work opportunities that come with this role (though in all honestly, I've had a really hard time motivating lately, especially with the extra-crappy promotion that decreased my pay and put me in the office *more*....so tbf I'm not producing work to the level I usually do.....).\\n\\n- MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CO-SUPERVISOR -- I have a direct counterpart who was also promoted to the supervisory role at the same time (these are two new positions that were just created), and I feel like we've trauma-bonded these last few months because of our manager, lol. It would suck to have to change our dynamic because it's one of my only silver linings to this job lately.\\n\\nWHAT WOULD YOU DO???\"", "title": "Should I demote myself?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bea1pt/should_i_demote_myself/"}, {"author": "aspen_carols", "created_utc": 1710391696.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1bed3ou", "score": 1, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"\\ud83d\\udcda Ace your IBM C1000-127 Certification with our ultimate preparation guide! \\ud83d\\udca5 Unlock your potential with sample questions and expert strategies! \\ud83d\\udd17 [Click Here](https://youtu.be/RoGGk9_VWKA) link in to get started!\"", "title": "Preparation Guide: IBM C1000-127 Certification | Crack Exam | Sample Questions", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bed3ou/preparation_guide_ibm_c1000127_certification/"}, {"author": "Medium_Rip2329", "created_utc": 1710390994.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1becw3t", "score": 1, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"I have some experience working in sales, real estate, graphic design and interior design.\\n\\nI have a degree in computer science, but soon after graduating I felt like I wouldn\\u2019t do very well working in the tech industry as I wasn\\u2019t really into programming and coding and gravitated more towards website design and then an opportunity fell into my lap to work for a prestigious construction company as a sales person, so I took it and I was successful and was able to generate leads and help close multiple deals however because of my shy and introverted nature I felt like all the pushiness of cold calls, emails and basically constantly nagging people seemed desperate and wasn\\u2019t for me so I quit. \\n\\nI then leaned into my passion of interior design and became a self taught drafter/ renderer of interiors and yet again I was able to make a living out of it, but it isnt a high paying job especially in this economy for a single mom trying to make it on her own.\\n\\nI have also some experience under my belt working in graphic design, especially digital design but I feel like most graphic design jobs require a lot more softwares than the ones that Im already familiar with and the pay isn\\u2019t great either.\\n\\nSo Im looking for career advice that utilizes my strengths and hones my skills and any suggestions on what softwares, courses I should take would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\nI realize that my experience is very broad and I never stayed in one job to get really good at it, which is why In trying to find a career that aligns well with my set of skills as well as my personality.\"", "title": "I need recommendations for a high paying careers for someone with experience in sales and design.", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1becw3t/i_need_recommendations_for_a_high_paying_careers/"}, {"author": "techperson1234", "created_utc": 1710390488.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 1, "post_id": "1becqef", "score": 1, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"Without going into too much detail, \\nI am a leader/ machine learning engineer in technology, what I would consider to be an overachiever (I poured my heart and soul into this startup) and have been working for the last 3.5 years with a good salary at said startup. \\n\\nWell, startup could not raise enough money given the current state of the economy during scaling and cut the fat in december to just a tech team of 7.

I finished a semester early due to taking a bunch of online classes during all summers due to covid. From September of 2019 - December of 2022 with my actual graduation being June 2023. So i\\u2019m a recent graduate-ish.\\n\\nSince August of 2021 i\\u2019ve been working remotely for a Staffing Agency based in the Bay Area as Marketing / Communications. They have been flexible and accommodating so they have kept me on while i\\u2019ve been job hunting. They underpay me (still a great company & culture) but since i\\u2019m the only person in their marketing department I get to learn a lot. Most of the time it\\u2019s me figuring everything out by myself and working with the CEO, HR, and IT departments. So I don\\u2019t have the most cutthroat knowledge of marketing but I have grown the company\\u2019s revenue and reputation since I started. I also have a couple additional clients that I do occasional design/ marketing work for. \\n\\nMy skills include Adobe Creative Cloud: Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator; Market Analysis, Content Writing, Email Marketing, Social Media Management and Content, Design (graphic and multimedia), learning some UI/UX now too as i\\u2019ve been put on a web project. Anything design and creative marketing oriented i\\u2019m good at. I just don\\u2019t have much on the analytical side. I also just redid my portfolio site and have all my work showcased there, I think it looks professional and gives a good idea on what I can do. My resume is geared more towards marketing than design. I label myself as a digital designer / digital marketer as I do a little bit of everything.\\n\\nI have been looking for a new job more full-time in Toronto (trying to get something more full-time in canada as on work permit and eventually aiming for dual citizenship) for a year now with little luck. Either no responses or I get a couple of interviews that only make past 1-3 rounds before they let me go.

I\\u2019m applying for entry level, associate level jobs but I only get interviews for Lead positions or positions under a director to help manage teams or additional projects.

But my situation is a bit unique and I was hoping to get the input of others.\\n\\nBackground: I'm an engineer living in Washington state with 8 years of experience.\\n\\nMy current job has a 3 minute commute, is nearly stress free, and pays 95k. I go into work, do my stuff, and then leave. I am just a staff level employee. I also do not work Fridays. My current schedule also allows for me to really help with my family (wife and 3 young kids). My coworkers are good, and my boss is great (best boss I've had). I am VERY comfortable where I'm at.\\n\\n\\nIn comes the second job. I was basically sought out due to my certain skill set (I have some advanced certifications not many people have), and before my current job I actually was a manager for 6 years (until I switched jobs and stepped down into my current staff level job). They heard of me through a friend of a friend of a friend. I spoke with a recruiter and immediately within 10 min I was offered a job. No resume. Just a casual conversation. I told them that 1: I'm never working Fridays again and 2: I only want to work 36 hours a week. And the recruiter said he'd have to ask the higher ups. I then went home thinking that that was the end of the conversation due to what I thought were nearly impossible requests.\\n\\n\\nThe next day I get an official offer for a manager position, for 115k, and a 10k sign on bonus. Note: I haven't even interviewed yet. The recruiter asks if we could set up a meeting to get interviewed at the new job. I figured I'd hear them out so I agreed. I get to the new job (only 6 minutes away vs 3 minutes) and the office is sort of depressing. 5 other employees with older computers/equipment, dimly lit, etc. The particular company was recently bought out twice within 2 years and is now part of a larger company. I interview with a guy named Jim and he seems to really like me. And I reiterated how I can't be available outside of my scheduled hours, despite them wanting me to be a manager. Jim didn't seem to care. After talking with Jim about what he expected I got the feeling that the particular office I was at wasn't doing great and was struggling and wanted me to breathe some life into it. \\\"We are looking for strong leaders to come in and prop this business up!\\\"\\n\\n\\nI left the interview not very excited about working there. I get another phone call from the recruiter who asked me what my offer was: \\\"was it 115k and 20k sign on bonus?\\\" I replied, : no it was only a 10k sign on bonus.\\\" So this recruiter then says \\\"oops my bad, let's make it 20k sign on then!\\\"\\n\\n...\\n\\n\\nThat's pretty much the background. My question is: would it be stupid to turn down this offer of 20k more salary and 20k sign on bonus?\\n\\nIt would definitely be more work as a manager, and like I mentioned before I'm very comfortable where I'm at now. My main goal in life right now is to focus on my family (but one can make the argument that getting an extra 20k in salary with a nice bonus would be focusing on my family as well as I'd be able to provide for them better).\\n\\n\\nAny thoughts?\\nThanks for the help in advance!\"", "title": "Should I take a new job for an extra 20k and a promotion?", "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bde5y4/should_i_take_a_new_job_for_an_extra_20k_and_a/"}, {"author": "wirlfirr", "created_utc": 1710329358.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 4, "post_id": "1bdp5u6", "score": 1, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"I am 3 months away from graduating from my masters in Architecture.

A few years ago I relocated temporarily with my partner, and worked at a factory where I learned how to use a CNC faster than anyone they had ever seen. Before I left, they offered me a management position to entice me to stay. I had been there less than 6 months. We left because my partner\\u2019s contract ended. They knew all this when hiring me and chose to take the risk on my candidacy, and felt it well worth it by the end of my stay. \\n\\nI also present well, and I am cordial and conversant in person, so I feel like some business must have a weird role that they can\\u2019t fill by requirements, where I would be a shoe-in to take on the role and learn it from scratch in all the required nuance. \\n\\nThe job market seems to suck right now (based on 6% unemployment rate despite 40k new jobs, and everyone on Reddit lamenting the current market).

When I first planned the LOA, I also planned on using this time off to job hunt as I am sick of my current position and feel I have gotten all I can out of the role. Taking the LOA instead of resigning was designed as a kind of insurance policy, meaning that if I didn't manage to find a new role then I could return to my old job at the end of the 8 month period. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nFortunately, on my last project before the leave, my then-client offered me a position which is directly linked to my new area of study. I expressed my keen (and genuine) interest. I am also fortunate in that they have been understanding of my need to take time off for my wedding, and that when I do return to work I would need to work in a part time capacity so to continue my study and also care for my elderly father. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nFor context, I dropped to a 4 day work week in my current role in early 2023 after my father was diagnosed with dementia so I could take some extra time to support him (although, given I work in consulting, this was not really honoured as part of the deadlines and I ended up work a huge amount of unpaid overtime). \\r  \\n\\r  \\nFast forward to today, with my study in full swing and wedding taking place a week ago, the recruiting contact from the client has reached out to me again so we can resume discussions about a potential role. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nHowever, since the start of this year, my father has taken a steep decline in his health. A bit out of the ordinary, but my father had me and my brother much later in life, meaning he is >80years old, whilst my brother and I are only in our mid-late 20s. He is steadily losing the ability to speak and I have discovered this week he no longer has the ability to write whatsoever. He mentioned in conversation with me this week that he knows now that \\u2018his time is limited\\u2019, and whether it be that I have been partially distracted by my marriage, the prospect of a new job, or starting new study, this stark realisation that he may not live until the end of the year has left me heartbroken and confused.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAdded, my father has always been a **very** difficult person so - I mean this literally - he does not have any relationships other than with myself and my brother. He has another son (my half brother) who he has no relationship with, and he and my mother are not on speaking terms after a bitter separation a few years back. \\n\\nHe lives alone at present in our family home, but has also flatly refused to ever be put in a care home and erupts at the idea of an in home carer saying that either scenario would see us cut off from him, so setting the expectation that my brother and I will be the ones to take care of him when he can no longer do so for himself. My brother and I have somewhat begrudgingly accepted this given our own individual relationship troubles with our father, and because we have career/life ambitions for our 20s, however, we have accepted it. Now this reality seems even sooner than I had originally anticipated. \\n\\n**My question: How do I approach the discussion with the would-be recruiter about the potential new job?** \\n\\nI want this job and I know they want to hire me given how accommodating and positive they have been, but I am worried that even if I were to work in a 3-day a week capacity, my father's health/requirements are such that in a couple months time I will not be able to fully commit to the role. \\n\\nI don't want to waste their time, nor mine and whilst I do feel comfortable explaining (at a high level) my situation to the person wanting to recruit me, I feel I need to come back to him with a proposal rather than just my problems. \\n\\nI think I could: \\n\\na.  Start the job in a month, try juggle it with study and dad-duties and see how it goes \\n\\nb.  Ask him to check in with me again in 6 months (although this feels like stringing him along)\\n\\nc. Put the career change on hold and ask for a guaranteed start at the beginning of 2025 (which I am fairly confident he will agree to as he mentioned it in the past) \\n\\nEach option has its drawbacks - slowed career progression, missed $, potential to pip the recruiter off, or miss out on precious time with my dad, who despite everything, I love. I also don't want to ruin my chances at this role by continuing to request a move in my start date. \\n\\nIs there another option I am not thinking of?

Come meet me at this day spa. \\n\\nAs we're sitting in one of he sauna's, she tells me, that she's starting to work for this commercial loan brokerage and if I want, to interview and if I get hired I can be a part of her team. I said, hell yeah! And she said maybe she could get me a membership to the spa so I could go whenever I wanted. This is after not knowing this woman as anything more than a very distant aquaintance.\\n\\nAnd two weeks later she invited me to her apartment and made me a home cooked meal and shared some really personal stories about her past. This little voice in my head was saying, \\\"Is she *love bombing* me?\\\" Like with the spa and the invitation to her home, the cooking, *and* the really intimate details about herself? This isn't a normal progression of a relationship, be it friendship, or coworker etc. I was aware of this and had my antennas up but proceeded forward.\\n\\n A few months ago I asked someone what he thought I should do for work and a commercial loan broker was what he recommended. \\n\\nAND a mentor I was paying a few months ago recommended this job to me too, out of the blue. Without even knowing what the job title was.\\n\\nI blew off both of these recommendations because I had a 9-5. Fast forward to now I quit my job and Elle comes out of nowhere and says to try out this job. \\n\\nAlso like ten years ago I got hired to work for a law firm and I worked for the commercial real estate agents on deals that always would have a broker involved. \\n\\nSo now I'm here looking back and thinking, this is meant to be.\\n\\nSo I interview, get the job and am excited. I get the questions I'll need to have on hand for potential clients and after a few networking events I finally meet someone who does a call with me. \\n\\nElle, gets wind of this situation and says, get me on the call, I'll lead it since I know what I\\\"m doing.\\n\\nI think to myself, I can do this on my own, but I can't say no, because she is my \\\"team lead.\\\" And I also want to know if she knows what she is doing and I want to see how she does business.\\n\\nWe have the call. She bombs it. She doesn't ask the right questions. She word salads, confidently. I stay silent. I can tell it's already over.\\n\\nThe deal drags on and with every following interaction she makes it worse. Thank god it was finally over and obviously the potential client went with another company. It was so embarrassing. \\n\\nAfterwards I asked her, even though in the contract it says no such thing, do I have to do every deal through her? (AKA split my commission with her). She said yes, until I \\\"know what I'm doing.\\\" She even used the word *mentor*. Which I would have *died* to hear someone say to me just a few months ago. But now it didn't feel right. I got royally scammed by an entire mentorship community and a psychopathic narcissist ex, the cream of the crop manipulation that now I had my eyes peeled for people looking for opportunities to take advantage of me more than ever before. I know that I'm vulnerable. And I'm learning, but predators can still probably smell me a mile away as an easy target.\\n\\nAnyways, I said \\\"okay\\\", but as soon as she said this I had a very strong reaction in my body. It was so unpleasant and powerful it reminded me of how I used to feel when I was with my toxic ex. It was my body telling me something bad was happening and I needed to listen. It took me hours to shake this feeling.\\n\\nSo what I need advice on is, now that I know my intuition is like, \\\"Bitch do NOT work with her, do NOT split your commission with her.\\\" I feel like after not listening so many times in the past and getting my ass whooped I need to let this \\\"opportunity\\\" go. When she first invited me to the spa and then to the dinner I started to put together some ideas in my head. I know that she's worked in the RE world for decades and never quite made it enough to be a team lead, so I figured that since it wasn't working out, she saw this as an opportunity for her to move into a new role, be a team lead and have a bunch of little team members working under her and giving her a split of all of their deals and poof she finally leveled up and made it. \\n\\nI understand that. Nothing wrong with that. Buuuuuuuut if I feel like she ran the deal well and I felt like I could learn from her, and there was no weird vibes I was getting, and there was no love-bombing and everything I just shared then I would happily be a team member but after that I feel like I could honestly do a better job on my own, which was my original plan, AND because that's what's on the independent contractor contract. It's only a verbal agreement that she is a team lead, but my contract says that my commission is to me only. SO \\n\\nI'm in this pickle where, ( and to give you context I'm unemployed right now, no savings, and zero prospects for incoming deals right now, driving uber and BARELY paying my rent every month ) I am trying to figure out what to do. Also I might add that even working alone with this company so far has made me lose faith and motivation because it doesn't  seem like they know what they're doing and they're literally preventing me from being able to do my job well because they are cockblocking me from the lenders so how the living hell am I supposed to effectively sell a product if I don't know it well myself? There is a person between me and the lenders who will not really answer my questions and doesn't seem to know the answers about the products they offer. So ..\\n\\nMy plan a week ago was to:\\n\\n1. Prepare to work independently. I want direct relationship and communication with my lenders. I want to know their products and the people that offer them. No middle men. I need to know exactly what I'm selling and who I need to look for to connect them.\\n2. I need a title. I have no background experience in anything real estate or business or finance so I figured the closest thing I can do is to become a MLO. Get some letters next to my name, so when I meet people I can tell them that's what I am and at least I will have state certified training and a NMLS#. Also if worst comes to worse I can always be an MLO and sell mortgages for homes.\\n3. Find my own lenders. Then, find people who need them. \\n\\nThis is my plan. But I have lost motivation because now I'm scared to leave this company. What do you guys think? Does this plan make sense? What am I missing?\\n\\nThe only thing else is that I'm not sure if this is the proper career for me. I don't have any experience in business deals and negotiating. I'm not creative with solutions and problem solving. And I'm not always the best when it comes to maintaining relationships and being \\\"likable.\\\" Also I hate the idea of having to have my face plastered all over social media promoting myself. I usually work best alone unless the people I'm working with have the same goal as me and are on the same team as me as in my level. They're not above or below me.\\n\\nThe alternative path, that I don't even have money for, but that is lingering in my brain, is to take a completely different path. And the reason why it's in my brain is because I think the lifestyle might be more suited for my personality, or lack there of. Having my own business through selling a product. Having my own brand (but I wouldn't be the brand). So not those social media influencers who *are their own brand* as personalities, but where I would pick something like a head band, product it, and sell it under my own brand and then hopefully scale up and build wealth that way. I won't have to work with so many people, I won't have to constantly be wheeling and dealing, I won't have to constantly be working for clients and on the phone with no time off, AND I wouldn't have to be working in a heavily male-dominated field where I honestly do not have the skills to hold my own at the moment. \\n\\nI know *nothing* about having a business and have almost no money to my name so I couldn't even start it now.  But I feel like maybe being able to run my own show would save me a lot of trouble because I would be the only one having to deal with myself, if you know what I mean, and I could run things in my own way, which I have to do everything, differently. \\n\\nSo what do you think? Any advice would be helpful. I will tell you that my work history is pretty sad. I've never stayed with a job for too long. I'm not great with commitment and persistence if I smell any type of bullshit going on, which is everywhere. And I haven't really built up the confidence and tactics to be able to hold my own against manipulators yet. Also I'm really not that smart. I just want to break out of this hourly wage situation and live a life where I can support myself and not be in poverty anymore.\\n\\n&#x200B;\"", "title": "Commercial Loan Broker or Business Owner?

I worked at a company and did their marketing for a few years started very under paid but worked my way up with a manager who became a friend. He ended up leaving the company and I was looked over for the position for an outside source. Also the turn over in the company and especially sales team and marketing team is crazy. In the time I was there the sales and marketing team had always been around 7-10 people and I\\u2019ve seen every single position on the team go through at least 3-4 times. I was the longest standing person on the team and that was just 2 years. When interviewing for the management position the CMO (who is a very petty man and it\\u2019s his way or the highway. He get very upset quickly and likes to talk down to people to make himself feel smarter and then I front of more people he acts nice a total douche.) He told me he was impressed with my interview and skills but I was lacking experience and hired someone else who ended up not really knowing much and I ended up doing all the work.\\n\\nFast forward the manager \\u201cleft\\u201d the company because he wasn\\u2019t happy and kept getting chewed out by the CMO.\\n\\nNow I interview for the promotion but the next day a family member passed away and took a week or so off and WFH for a month to be with family. When I come back to office I am told I didn\\u2019t show my manager skills or step up for the position and am getting passed up again for someone who used to be a sales manager that left the company but was called to return because she wasn\\u2019t happy at her new job and because the new sales and marketing manager (she has no marketing knowledge or background).  She has a meeting with me and says she doesn\\u2019t want to get in my way of growth so let\\u2019s make a plan to grow in the company and gives options I can do. I accept she always acted nice in front of me and talked shit about the CMO behind his back about how unreasonable and shitty he was but would brown nose hard in front of him. She said that\\u2019s the game and gotta play the game.

But now she has me looking for someone to replace the missing team member. She ends up interviewing and finding another girl. (It\\u2019s also been heard that the CMO preferred younger girls on the team and people and even the manager have noted he\\u2019s very icky about it) any way the Friday before the new girl starts I get sent to a meeting with her and the manager and tell me I\\u2019m getting let go. The CMO who has been very involved and micromanages the team didn\\u2019t come in or say a word to me. \\n\\nI\\u2019m shocked at this point.

This means I need a mentor to sign off on my paperwork to earn my certification. I have a master's degree in my field and I'm halfway through my CFY (clinical fellowship year).

I see pediatrics and parents often cancel or no show due to things going on with their kids. I am  not paid for any of those. So I will be sitting at work not making money when I had scheduled appointments.  I feel my boss is exploiting me (the pay rate is very low) and I have asked four times for health insurance which was promised. I've been there 6 months and was supposed to get it after 60 days. I'm in a healthcare field constantly exposed to germs (got Covid from work a couple months ago) and I don't have health insurance through work... kind of ridiculous.

I have anxiety due to the commute, learning a whole new way of doing things, new supervisor, etc. I also might have a ton of paperwork to do in this job, IEP meetings, etc. They are not giving me much detail and when I asked or tried to find out info, I was snapped at. There's a lot of unanswered questions. The special ed director was very curt and rude. She would not be my direct supervisor, but she is the lead supervisor. The thing is, switching CF supervisors can lead to a lot of headache because then you have more than one person you need to sign off on your paperwork. Sometimes they are reluctant to do  it for you. I also don't know this new supervisor so I have no idea what to expect or what they will be like. Your CF supervisor literally holds the key to whether or not you get your certification in the field so a lot of power is in their hands. This is part of my anxiety.

I would qualify for unemployment at that rate if needed because it a W-2 contract position. I was not given a lot of details about this job. When I tried to ask, the SPED director was very curt and short with me.

Over time, I've transitioned into more creative roles within the company's operations, particularly in marketing and communications.  \\nFast forward to now, I've landed a full-time role as a marketing and communications specialist after graduating. However, my luck seems to have run out, and I'm at a crossroads trying to figure out my next move.  \\nFirst off, my bosses are incredibly unsupportive and unreliable. My direct supervisor, Will, is unprofessional and consistently passive-aggressive, undermining my work with comments like \\\"AI can do your job.\\\" Meanwhile, my other boss, Jenny, tends to complicate even the simplest tasks, making it challenging to meet deadlines, which she sets herself. A recent example is a major project I'm working on \\u2013 building a new employee website from scratch \\u2013 which she's derailed multiple times, diverting my focus to trivial matters like setting up for office events.  \\nBut here's the kicker: despite being in this marketing role for almost a year now, I only received a job description yesterday. Without it, my bosses have been assigning me tasks outside my scope and refusing to consider me for a salaried position. Going through the document, while it secures my job, it doesn't bode well for a pay raise. Currently making $20 an hour, which is decent but not great for Connecticut, I'm disappointed to find myself squarely within the middle of the salary range ($35,000 - $50,000), hinting that a raise wasn't on their agenda. What's more infuriating is that my boss's nephew, doing similar work to what I started with, earns nearly $10,000 more than me, despite my longer tenure and more demanding role.  \\nThis nepotism doesn't end there \\u2013 his friends, also hired through him, enjoy similar pay disparities.

To give a bit of background, this a career pivot for me. I was originally going into social work and found myself working for an attorney for a few years instead and that is when I realized I did not want to pursue social work anymore. I spent a few years working in both legal and social work field and realized I could not do it long term as I lost the passion and felt I would burn out by time I reached my 30s. \\n\\nFast forward a year and I am now working in higher education as an administrative employee. I currently have great benefits, especially the health insurance which was basically the only reason that I took this job. The pay absolutely sucks. I am making less now than I made while in my last 2 years of undergrad so thats saying a lot. I love my coworkers, the job is not bad but it is not what I want to do and I cannot see myself doing a higher up role in this field. My resume is pretty bad as far as diversity and work experience, I have 3 years legal secretary, 1 year social work, now 1 year at the college. \\n\\nMy issue is I am not entirely sure what I want to do with my life. I was hoping I could break into the HR field but it just seems like a very oversaturated field and I also feel like I will not enjoy it as much. I am really only thinking about HR because I know it is a stable field with many options within various industries. But now I am thinking that is just not what I want to do either. \\n\\nI do not graduate with my MBA until Fall of 2025 and I would really like this time to explore career options and maybe snag a couple internships or two. Currently, I am leaning towards financial analyst/planning field. Something I have always been interested in, however, its more of a hobby than anything. I have a total obsession with investments, analyzing stocks, planning future financials etc. I have been indulging in the stock market since 2020 and have been completely OBSESSED since. I have gained a lot of money and have been very successful at it. Over the past year the obsession grew so much to the point I created my own mini books and accumulated knowledge about the stock market. My boyfriend even stated \\\"you need to make a career out of this.\\\" Well maybe I can? \\n\\nI know financial/planning analysts its not all about the stock market, it comes with more in regards to helping those expand their finances to obtain profit and so on. Here is where I need advice, should I leave my job where I have good benefits but little pay to explore other job opportunities? There is currently a firm in my town that offers many internships in the financial analyst field, but only part-time so I will making less money. But not going to lie, working full-time (sometimes overtime) it has been really hard for me to keep up with my studies. I just reached my 1 year at my new job and I feel like I need to explore other options to find my niche. I am also very worried I won't find a job post-MBA due to lack of experience. However, I am very comfortable and need my health insurance. I would lose all my benefits and even retirement (need to stay for 3 years to receive the match). But, my boyfriend and I (8 years very serious relationship) are discussing us eloping so I can be on his health insurance so I can look for jobs or internships I would like to pursue instead of just jobs that offer health insurance that I don't even want to do. He also is head of household and makes enough money where I could not work at all and we would still be fine. So working part-time would not be an issue for an internship or job to gain experience. \\n\\nThe last 2 years have been non-stop waking up with intense anxiety and just all around being a miserable person because I am spending all this time and energy on things I don't want to do.

On one hand, this placement could provide invaluable experience and a significant edge in the job market post-graduation. On the other, the commute and extended duration of my studies are significant considerations. Plus, the uncertainty of securing a placement next year if I decline this offer is a constant worry.\\n\\nWhat would you do in my shoes? Accept the placement and adjust my course duration, or take a gamble and search for opportunities next year, potentially closer to home or in my penultimate year?

I\\u2019m having a hard time figuring out what I want to do with my life. I\\u2019m 29 and really would have liked to have a career by now but it is what it is. \\n\\nThis is probably really long so TL;DR at the bottom.\\n\\nI have a bachelor\\u2019s in psych and am currently a \\u201cfull-time\\u201d substitute teacher (I\\u2019m still considered per diem but I work in two large districts with sub shortages so I work every day). I enjoy it but miss some aspects of my last job. \\n\\nSo I worked in the ABA field as a behavior therapist (BT) for about 6 years (basically behavioral therapy with mainly autistic kids). I loved many things about it. I loved the science, the process, the outcomes, etc. I didn\\u2019t expect to love it when I started I just wanted a relevant job in the field while getting my BA. I even started to pursue licensure and got my BCaBA (asst supervisor basically) and worked as a mid-level case manager which I loved even more. Designing my own programs, following up with parents, etc. the only thing I didn\\u2019t love was training new hires and performing monthly fidelity checks with every BT (important to do but not my fav). I even began to pursue masters/licensure. But I burnt out really really hard. \\n\\nThere were a lot of reasons why, and a lot of reasons why I wanted to tough it out but I ended up leaving my company and basically went back to being a full time BT except in school. During this time I came to love the classroom environment but behavioral therapy left such a bitter taste in my mouth so I decided to look into teaching. That was about two years ago now and I\\u2019ve been subbing for about 1.5 years. I enjoy a lot of it and I have been interested in seeking a teaching credential to go full time.\\n\\nBut the past year has been a lot of work figuring out who I am and what I want the rest of my life to look like. And regarding my career I am very interested in teaching but I realized something: I really miss helping people. I miss seeing my clients grow and change. I miss forging relationships with them. Honestly, I even miss managing crisis situations. They are tough and not fun but very rewarding, and honestly, I kinda of crave them in a way, I never WANT them to happen but stepping in and de escalating situations made me feel like\\u2026 idk like I was meant to be doing it? I\\u2019m not sure how to explain but I felt very in my element.\\n\\nI can definitely get some of those from teaching but not to the degree I had before. I\\u2019ve had great moments subbing long term for the same classrooms. I love the creativity of making my own lessons and I love being with a student with learning challenges, because figuring out how to get them to understand and then seeing them do it is sooo rewarding for me. So here\\u2019s my dilemma. \\n\\nBasically I loved ABA but I burned out very hard on it. I like teaching but I am not sure if it\\u2019s exciting enough for me. I\\u2019m interested in other psychology fields or even special ed but I have no experience in the former and the latter has its own issues. \\n\\nSome things I enjoy: I like doing my own thing my own way, I like starting things by the book and finding creative ways to teach/help/solve a problem. But I also very much like collaboration. I like helping people. I like working with kids (big brother syndrome lol). I like a mix of both laid-back and challenging, otherwise too easy I\\u2019m bored, too challenging I burnout. I like forging a (professional) relationship with clients/students. Also, I like when I can be very fun while still being productive. Being too professional all the time is boring to me. \\n\\nThings I don\\u2019t want: too much oversight. Fields where it\\u2019s \\u201cexpected\\u201d of me to overwork. Lack of consistency with clients, hours, schedule (especially schedule that\\u2019s a big reason why working in schools interested me). Having to go back to school that will take more than 2 years at most.\\n\\nTL;DR I\\u2019m subbing in elem schools rn, and I have a psych/ABA background, but I\\u2019m unsure of whether to continue with teaching or go back to psych/behavioral health field.

Then I enjoyed it so much that I decided to move here for good in September last year. The weather is obviously great, I've a good group of friends here, I enjoy learning a new language, I'm dating a girl that I really enjoy spending time with and so on. It has always been a big wish of mine to live abroad and I'm finally doing it. So far so good.\\n\\nAnother big goal of mine is to have my own (small) business at some point and I always try to build something on the side in the hopes that one of these experiments gets some traction and provides value to people. Because of that and also because I didn't feel that I was growing anymore in my current company, I decided to quit it to go into freelancing.\\n\\nUnfortunately, as you probably know, the market is really bad atm and I barely get any response from any potential clients I reach out to but I already got two amazing offers from big companies in the German market with compensation packages that I never thought would have been attainable to me. However, both wanted me to come back to their office in Germany which was the reason I declined them. \\n\\nThis is my first month without a job and I'm currently sitting on a runway of about 6 months, so my main goal at the moment is to figure out my next career move. I'm using my time to reach out to potential freelancing clients every day and keep myself interview-ready by revisiting DS&A and system design topics. I also continue building my current side project. \\n\\nExperiencing this market, however, I feel more and more that it might not work out since most clients want somebody with more years of experience and I might be forced to also send out some applications for full-time positions. Looking into the Spanish market makes me afraid that I won't be getting some decent money (minimum 40k) and a position that I'd like to work in.\\n\\nNow I'm reconsidering all my options. I'm thinking about sending applications everywhere in Europe just to check what opportunities I'm having and then take a decision, even though I'd like to stay in Valencia. I value a healthy and balanced lifestyle but I can definitely work hard and would also love to contribute to something meaningful. There are also definitely companies that I'd like to work for, e.g. Stripe, Spotify, Apple, to name a few...\\n\\nWhat would you do if you were in my situation? Would you continue trying to score a freelancing gig? If you were to send out applications, would you focus on the Spanish market first and only look abroad if nothing is appealing?

TL;DR at end. If you want the lean meat of it, skip the backstory. Its there to help better understand, and more for me to document how I ultimately felt, as I never honestly had an outlet to turn to.\\n\\n**Backstory**\\n\\nA not so quick backstory, I work for a private company with a few thousand workers, but makes billions in profit. The company is family owned, and for all intensive purposes is what some would refer as to a place for \\\"good ol' boys\\\". To keep a long background short, I work in a department as a Software Developer, and I'd love to advance in my position to the next title at this company. I do not hate this company, wish any ill will, and have a fantastic working relationship with my immediate coworkers.\\n\\nAgain, I enjoy my coworker, and I care about the company and it's values; however, my situation has begun taking a dive to where I'm beginning to lose confidence. Last January, John told me that I've been exceling and producing great work, I have exceeded in my goals, and I have really become a mentor to my other team members, and if I continued to meet these goals I would have a strong case for a promotion.\\n\\nIn March yearly reviews came and I got great marks that I met goals and someitmes exceeded expectations, I asked of the defined goals, and was told I'm by all means already doing everything a Senior Software Developer in this role should be doing, and said he would talk his manager about looking at moving me into that position, and that getting a perfect review is something they don't do, but he was going to advocate for me to get a promotion. John has been in my back corner.\\n\\nMonths passed, and our one on ones did not yield much. He spoke to Bob (Middle manager) about it before, but it is a long process, and the companies HR is particularly slow. I accepted this for the time being, but as time passed, and October came and my job responsibilities and challenges became harder to deal with I ultimately asked for another follow up in October 2023.\\n\\nIn this chat, John agreed and reiterated his position that he believes I am ready for this position, but it is out of his hands. He told me it may be benefitial to talk to his manager Bob, but warned me it may be out of his hands as well. I took this advice, and reached out to Bob.\\n\\nMy chat with Bob was less than ideal, and ultimately confusing. This meeting was not short and sweet, but it felt like it flew by. It has been awhile, so the details escape me, but we had some at the time odd conversations. I asked him questions about the organizational structure, titles, goals, etc. and I was given questionable responses that left me feeling a bit confused as he didn't exactly answer my question, instead asked me questions about the company, organizational structure, etc. And I gave him my personal feedback, and every answer had a rebuttal that we respectfully agreed to disagree on. However, the gist of this meeting was that he heard great things from John, and would make an appeal, but iterated to me the same thing that HR is slow, but I'm free to follow up with him for updates. So, I can summarize that what John told me reflected what Bob told me. That was definitely relieving, and I could accept that. I'd love to give more detail. but I never felt the need to document any of this as up to this point I felt everyone was on my side.\\n\\nA few more months had gone, and from talks with John, he assured me that he KNOWS and is positive Bob did make an appeal, and it would just take time. This time it was December, and I felt it was time for a follow up to Bob for an update or if there was anything I could do such as talk to Bobs manager, or HR to learn more, as well as get feedback from him, and just catch up.\\n\\nSmall aside, around this time in Decemember, emails circulated of congratulating many higher ups on new roles and promotions. This is what ultimately led me to want to follow up, as it was a good sign the company had it in their mind.\\n\\nThis is where I started to question Bob. Our conversation started normal; however, he avoided talking about the promotion, and only reiterated it would take time. I probed a little deeper, and he became visually a little more frustrated.\\n\\nTypes of questions/responses he began asking me:'Why does the title even matter? I personally believe they don't, why are you so fixated on this role?'\\n\\n'The roles and levels at this company are different than other companies. A senior here may not reflect the level of a senior in another role.'\\n\\n'The pay of this company matches to standard of the area.'\\n\\nI asked him questions about defining the roles and responsibilities, but he never answered any of my questions, only asked more questions out of me, and rebutted my questions.\\n\\nI found these questions/responses to be a bit odd and out of left field, and frankly a little defensive, but the tone of it was an honest, but blunt discussion which I do not mind. The end result was the same as before, a weird conversation met with a less than optimistic hope of a promotion.\\n\\nI talked to John, who reassured me, that March was rolling around in a few months, which could be a good time for raises and promotions, as that is when annual incentives come around.The last time i followed up with Bob (my middle manager), was in mid December, it was now March of this year. My last conversation left me with little hope he would give me a straight answer. Yearly reviews came, and I got marks that I Overly Exceeded Expectations, at our company, there is not a better review you can get, and is exceeding rare for an employee to get according to my manager John. Yearly incentives came, and I didn't receive anything more than the next employee. I was a little disheartened, and ultimately talked to John, who said there wasn't much he could do, and that Bob had put me in, but again it will just take time. A week and a half ago, I decided to pull myself up by my bootstraps, and talk to HR to ultimately ask about promotions within the company, and if I could have some visibility into the situation, as at this point I was confused by Bob's last conversation with me.\\n\\nDisclaimer, I told them I did not care if I did not receive the position, all I wanted was information on my current job role, and how I can tend my goals to reach the next role.\\n\\nHR reached back out to me that they followed up with my leadership chain, and there would be value in continuing to address my converns with my leadership. They also said their understanding is that progressions are not gauranteed and factor in more than just time in a position/years of experience.\\n\\nThis is where I became confused. I am at a time in my career, where I should be moving to that next step,had been performing above my role by many means consistently, with Johns stamp of approval.\\n\\nWhy mention years of experience like that as if that is my argument when it isn't? That was a little confusing. I asked if they had received anything from my leadership, any appeals, or what have you. HR responded by requesting my leadership have a chat with me to make sure nothing has been miscommunicated.\\n\\n**Present**I was contacted by my middle manager, Bob, as a follow up to my concerns. The overall tone of this meeting was unproductive and a little hostile.\\n\\nThe meeting started out with a statement, and a question he had asked before. 'You said before you were not concerned about titles, so why are you so fixated on titles now.' I responded that I actually had changed my mind a little on this topic after much thought.\\n\\nWhen I responded before, I told him that the title didn't necessarily matter as much as feeling valued, and a financial increase due to my merits was just as well a sign that they value my efforts and make me feel like I am making progress at this company, not as a job, but as a career. My responsibilities had increased, and even if i didn't have a title, the pay increase would be a sign that they acknowledge that. He said that makes sense, and agreed to that extent.\\n\\nThis time, I stated I feel the titles do matter. As they set clear bounds and objectives for what my role performs and expects out of me, and without them the bounds are gone, and it's hard to tell where they begin and end. It is hard to know if you are making career progress otherwise.\\n\\nHis rebuttal to this has been irking me. He stated that at the company, titles don't mean anything. Junior developers can be given AWS cloud architectural tasks, and seniors can be given simple defects. The umbrella has these titles, but everyone is equal in the eyes of the company, and everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and are allowed the opportunity for these challenges.\\n\\nOpinion: This is a nice thought, but I personally think it has a lot of flaws. In my company many are overworked, where some are cruising by. Talent is leaving and coasters are keeping the status quo.\\n\\nHe said he was comfortable in his position, and doesn't even know how much he is paid at this point, and doesn't care. He says he know he will never be VP or anything like that, and is okay with it, and said I shouldn't care either because two years down the line I will be in the same position asking for the next thing, and there is only so much movement in the company that there isn't a point. He stated the roles themselves have a high pay range, which offsets the number of positions.\\n\\nThat would be fine, but I haven't seen a raise based on individual performance, despite excellent reviews stating I have consistently been exceeding expectations, so I don't know how to feel about that.\\n\\nOpinion: I feel he is one of those cruisers, and may be projecting some of this onto me.\\n\\nThis next conversation leads to my biggest talking point, that is causing me a lot of stress. About our yearly incentive raises (company wide inflation raises), the yearly incentive raise came, and he asked if I was not happy with it. I responded, well from what I gathered it was a company wide thing, and everyone got roughly the same (which is from conversations with other coworkers who freely gave this information).\\n\\nThis is the response that fueled my stress, and this post. I could accept the previous stuff, but I felt really wrong about this.\\n\\n>\\\"Wait, wait, wait.... How did you even know that everyone made the same amount?\\\"\\n\\nI responded, well, everyone has been talking about it.. and..\\n\\n>He interrupts,\\\"I don't know what you think you know, but you aren't supposed to do that. ive been working for 30 years, and I don't know why you think this now, but you can be fired for this. This can be grounds for firing.\\\"\\n\\nI made the most confused face at this point. The way he said it didn't feel like he was threatening, but I knew for a fact that this is dead wrong. I wish I had recorded this, and in retrospect because of this statement, i will document all further interactions. I can't change that unfortanetly.\\n\\nside note: a coworker recently quit, and stated that another manager had told them not to discuss their raise with anyone else. So this may not be isolated to just this manager.\\n\\nI told him I disagreed completely, and he stated I don't need to be discussing that with my coworkers, that it was toxic, and in all his years working has done nothing but breed toxicity.\\n\\nThis was a bit unprofessional on my part, but I stated \\\"I disagree, what about 40 hour work weeks? I think a lot of good has come out of talking about your salary and working conditions.\\\"\\n\\nThe conversation further devolved when I said, I just wanted to make sure I was valued what I felt like I was valued. I know from previous conversations he doesn't care about market value and thinks it is trash, while siting sites like levels.fyi as his source for comparisons. Not a productive chat, but ultimately lead to this question he asked me.\\n\\n>What do you feel you are valued at?\\n\\nObviously opinion, but what I said: Currently, my total compensation is \\\\~$120k. I stated $130-140k was a fair valuation based on market, peers, and my understanding of my role.*Fair warning, he misunderstood me in this moment. He acknowledged my total compensation, but when i stated my values, he thought I only meant salary, without the annual incentives and total comp.*\\n\\nHis reaction to that; however, misunderstooding or not has really felt horrible. He laughed, not just a chuckle, but a hardy, head up belly laugh, followed by his nose to the keyboard. He simply said \\\"I very much disagree\\\", and I stated, \\\"Oh I meant total compension, not just salary\\\" and he reeled back and was like \\\"Oh okay, that makes more sense\\\".\\n\\nBut that kind of reaction felt unwarranted. Anyways, I ended the conversation telling him it's okay to agree to disagree, and I respect him and the company, but I didn't feel much better about the situation, but I can accept it.\\n\\nThat may have been a lie... I haven't been able to accept it. It's really been bothering me.\\n\\n**TL;DR**I talked to my middle manager and he stated that he submitted me for a position, but it hasn't come. When I followed up, I was met with some hostility, told I've overstepped my bounds by discussing salary with other employees, and ultimately had none of my questions answered when it comes to my goals and jobs responsibilities.\\n\\nWhat should I do? I really enjoy the company I work for, but i don't know if my middle manager is truly reflecting the companies values or if he is reflecting his own.\\n\\nShould I approach HR again and see if his thoughts are truly those of the company?\\n\\nShould I just drop it, tuck my legs, swallow my pride, and look for another job?\\n\\nDid I doom myself?\\n\\nHas anyone created a stressful situation like this for themselves? How was it resolved, any advice is appreciated. Thanks.\\n\\nEdit: I am a full time employee, in regards to the legality of the statement made. Thanks for the heads up on including that.\\n\\nEdit: I am on my 6th year of career experience.

I\\u2019m looking for some advice before I get even deeper in wasted time and debt. I really don\\u2019t know what to do with my future regarding both my actual professional career and possible future schooling. I have the privilege of still living with my parents and having this time to figure things out. \\n\\nHere\\u2019s a little bit about me:\\n- I recently graduated with a B.S. in neuroscience and cogsci. I prefer the cognitive side of things, but don\\u2019t completely exclude the other.\\n- I\\u2019d like a Masters and have looked at programs in the UK (I\\u2019m American) because they seem to be better quality + my partner lives there. Not sure if this is worth it other than for experience and certification in something more specific. I also don\\u2019t want to drown in loans for no reason (the process of taking out loans also seems more complicated for international study). \\n- My strengths lie in writing, analysis, research-related skills, and so on. Some things that have piqued my interest are science writing, intraoperative neuromonitoring, and in general, developmental neuroscience. \\n- I worked as a lab RA for a non - wet lab for a while and I liked it, but the pay I\\u2019ve heard the higher ups get is unfortunately not anywhere near what I\\u2019m looking for. I also do not want to work in academia, especially as I have family that does and I know what the culture tends to be like. (I flat out don\\u2019t want to deal with the university staff and students either, lol) I\\u2019ll likely work at a lab again soon just for experience. \\n\\n\\nI would seriously appreciate any ideas regarding careers I might like and paths I could take academics-wise. More direct paths sound good at this point (i.e., get this certification and know you\\u2019re doing it to get this job right after finishing) because of job security, obviously.

I started PRN and was wanting to move to a part time position as that would work best for my lifestyle and provide an adequate enough income.  ( My husband is in his medical residency and works 80+ hrs a week, we have 3 dogs, we recently moved to a new state where we don\\u2019t have any support system, and are trying to conceive our first child due to medical reasons. ) \\n\\nFast forwarding the long backstory: I took a FT night position I never wanted. I work w/ th/ fr \\n\\nPros: \\n1. Quieter and less drama amongst co workers \\n2. Usually (not always) small patient load \\n3. I work consecutive nights each week\\n4. I generally like my co workers \\n5. FT pay \\n\\nCons: \\n1. I physically don\\u2019t see my husband for a few days \\n2. When I do see my husband our sleep schedules are so different our time spent together is limited \\n3. My sleep schedule is erratic and I live off of melatonin to try to sleep, but my dogs wake me in the day. My Fitbit tracks my sleep and I get an average of 3 hrs at a time since working this shift. \\n4. It\\u2019s affecting my mental and physical health. I feel drained most of the time. \\n5. I don\\u2019t have anyone to ask for help at 2am \\n6. The CALL SHIFT once a month sat- sun 36hrs \\n\\nI live 45minutes away from work and I work Friday 5:45 pm until Saturday 6:15am then I IMMEDIATELY start my 36hr call. This has been an issue because each time I\\u2019ve done this I  get called in typically 30min -1hr after getting off and it\\u2019s not just one patient it\\u2019s usually 3-8 patients (Saturdays are busy). Usually at this point I\\u2019ve been up 20hrs.  My one weekend of call I worked 30hrs and got next to no sleep and I didn\\u2019t even get to eat bc I was trying to sleep. I broke down hysterically crying by Sunday afternoon. \\n\\nI made it clear in a meeting I didn\\u2019t feel safe doing this and she agreed to fix it. (Without my knowledge they were hiring a part time person which made me upset because that\\u2019s the position I wanted but was told they weren\\u2019t going to hire part time. I felt manipulated into taking the least desirable shift because they knew they would be hard pressed to fill the position. ) I found this out right before the meeting. BUT bc we had this PT  it was decided that night shift would split the shift and each do 18hrs of call and the part time person would take one of our call shifts so the rotation would still be once a month. Which was significantly better for me. We did this for a month and it was tolerable. \\n\\nPRESENT DAY: the part time person declined the position and now the other night shift employee won\\u2019t split shift anymore because  it requires her to do 2 sat a month and me 2 Sundays a month. Instead she would like to do schedule change every week to accommodate call but I will not because I can\\u2019t have my sleep schedule jump all over the place. \\n\\nCONCERN FOR THE FUTURE: I am on call \\nEaster and it happens to be the same weekend as my call. Instead if of 36hrs of call I will be doing 48. CONSECUTIVE HRS OF CALL call ( w/o sleep because I work Friday to Saturday.)\\n\\nI have terrible anxiety and don\\u2019t know what to do or if it\\u2019s even legal.

I feel it would be different if we didn\\u2019t see so many patients but Saturdays it\\u2019s usually 4-12 patients Sundays 3-8 patients.

Read it and tell me if any of these advices are bad and if there is anything you would like to add that I missed. You may have noticed that I listed behaviors and mindsets, I did not draft specific answers to specific questions. That is a conversation for another day.\\n\\n1. Take Gas X before an interview. \\n\\nThis way, you do not fart during the interview. \\n\\nTaking Imodium is a way to ensure that you will not need to get up in the middle of an interview to go to the bathroom. Telling the interviewer, in the middle of the interview, that you have to go to the bathroom and you cannot hold it, is really emabarassing. \\n\\nYou should go to the bathroom before getting in your car to leave for the interview. That is a wise decision just generally, before you begin car travel, go to the bathroom, even if you do not need to. That way, you will not need to go to the bathroom while in the car. \\n\\n2. If possible chew on some breathe freshening gum before the interview. \\n\\nThis way, your breathe will smell good. \\n\\nAlso, do not smoke or drink before the interview. It is illegal for the interviewer to ask if you smoke or drink, but there is a very good chance that the interviewer will smell it. \\n\\n3. Do not arrive more than 10 minutes early. \\n\\nYou should not be more than 10 minutes early. This means that you should not enter the building more than 10 minutes early, there is nothing wrong with parking in the parking lot more than 10 minutes early. That said, aim to arrive in the parking lot approximately 30 minutes before the interview is supposed to start. Wait until 10 minutes before the designated starting time of the interview before you actually enter the building. \\n\\nIf the interview starts at 2:00 p.m., aim to arrive in the parking lot at 1:30 p.m. Wait until 1:50 p.m. before entering the building. \\n\\n4. Bring a water bottle. \\n\\nIf you experience dry mouth, you will be able to take a sip of water. If the interviewer asks you a question and you need a moment to think of a good answer, you can sip your water while the interviewer waits patiently to hear your response. \\n\\n5. Do not sit in the interview chair until you are invited to do so. \\n\\nStand there and wait to be told to sit down. \\n\\n6. What if you cannot think of a good answer? \\n\\nEither\\u2026 \\n\\nAsk the interviewer if you can email him/her the answer. \\n\\nOR\\n\\nPolitely ask the interviewer if you can go back to that question later. \\n\\nTo see Richard McMunn explain how that would work, click this link ( https://youtu.be/3PCE7GalxJU?si=Fyue2uiUXCUR5ikQ ). \\n\\n7. Do not say \\u201cthat is a great question.\\u201d \\n\\nThere really is not much to explain here. The interviewer clearly agrees that it a a good question, or else he/she would not have asked it. Just do not say that. \\n\\n8. Do not speak negatively about your former employer or coworkers. \\n\\nIf you where that negative about your former employer or coworkers, that is a red flag to the employer that you will be negative at this new job. \\n\\n9. When the Interview asks \\u201cwhy should we hire you?\\u201d don\\u2019t just give one reason. \\n\\nGive at least three reasons. \\n\\n10. When the interview tells you to introduce yourself. \\n\\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to be interviewed for this position today. Having studied the job description, I am confidant that I have the skills, qualities and qualifications necessary to excel in the role. I am a fast learner, I possess excellent problem solving capabilities and I can manage a significant work load. I have an impressive track record of achievement. For example, when I completed an internship in college, my supervisor said that I was a pleasure to have around and that I made the work that we did more interesting. I acted as a positive role model for younger students. I will surely take responsibility for my ongoing professional development. If you hire me, I am sure that you will see a positive return on your investment. \\n\\nAlso, ask the interviewer what it was about your resume that they liked. Then, reference that strength as much as possible during the interview. \\n\\n11. Take a phone interview as seriously as you would an in person interview. \\n\\nDress up as you would for an in person interview. The interviewer will not see you, but psychologists believe that dressing up makes you more likely to act professional. Make sure that your battery is fully charges. \\n\\n12. Claim that the job description is perfectly aligned with your experience and qualifications. \\n\\nThis is a brilliant thing to say and it will resonate positively with the interviewer, if in fact it is true. \\n\\n13. I have researched the company in detail and I am impressed with your values, the way you treat your customers and the way you strive to improve. \\n\\nSay this to the interviewer. This will show that you are passionate about the role. \\n\\nWe spend many hours at work. If you are passionate about what you do and if you are passionate about what you do, you are more likely to get the job. \\n\\n14. Do not move anything around in the room. \\n\\nIt is the way that it is for a reason. Do not even ask about why something is arranged the way that it is, it is none of your business. \\n\\n15. Do not tell the interviewer that you are nervous. \\n\\nInterviewers love confidant people. However, you do not actually have to be confidant, you just have to appear confidant. If you are nervous deep down, that is fine. However, keep it to yourself. \\n\\n16. Do not ask; what does your company do? \\n\\nYou are supposed to prepare by doing your research before the interviewer. Asking this question makes it obvious you did not do that. \\n\\nAlso, be prepared to answer the question; What can you tell me about our company? \\n\\n17. Do not say; I will do anything. \\n\\nWhat you should say is that you are flexible, adaptable and willing to carry out tasks outside your job description, to assist the company. \\n\\n18. Never say; It\\u2019s on my resume. \\n\\nIf it is on your resume, then you should remember putting it there. Just answer the question as though the person to whom you are speaking never read your resume. \\n\\n19. Do not say that you are a perfectionist when asked about weaknesses. \\n\\nYou could instead say something like; \\n\\nI try to solve problems on my own when I should be asking for help. \\n\\nI am not very good at public speaking. \\n\\nI have a hard time saying no, so I take on too many responsibilities. \\n\\n20. Do not request time off during an interview. \\n\\nThis tells the hiring manager that you are already thinking about not being at work and you have not even been hired. \\n\\nWait until you have been offered the job, before requesting time off. \\n\\n21. Closing statements. \\n\\nTry one of these. \\n\\n- Thank you for the chance to be interviewed for the role. I have thoroughly enjoyed the process, and in particular learning about your company, your plans and how I can help you achieve them. I genuinely believe I can add significant value to your company and I would love the opportunity to prove to you my worth. Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you. \\n\\n- I just want to say thank you for inviting me to the interview today. I have been nothing but impressed with the professionalism and the manner in which the interview has been conducted. I genuinely want to work for your company, and I think you will see a strong return on your investment if you hire me. If you need further information, do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you in due course. \\n\\nIf the interview did not go very well and there where several questions you where unable to answer, try this. \\n\\n- Thank you for taking the time to interview me today. I apologise for not being able to answer several of your questions. However, having studied the company in detail, I really do believe I am a great fit for your company long term. If you hire me, I will work hard to repay the trust you will have shown in hiring me, and I will help your business to thrive. Thank you very much and I look forward to hearing from you in due course. \\n\\n22. Do not say that you do these things in your free time. \\n\\nWatch television, play video games, go out drinking with your friends and scroll social media. \\n\\nThis makes it sound like you do not make good use of your time. \\n\\nAlso, do not tell the interviewer that you spend most of your free time working. If you claim that you will also be working elsewhere, it will lead the interviewer to believe that you will not be 100% while at work. \\n\\n23. When the interviewer asks; what makes you unique? \\n\\nDo not tell the interviewer that you are hard working and professional. That is a basic requirement of all jobs. \\n\\n24. A second interview is NOT merely a formality. \\n\\nYou should put just as much effort and preparation into your second interview as you did your first one. \\n\\nOften, there will be someone at the second interview who was not there for the first one. This is because the interviewer is seeking a second opinion. \\n\\n25. Never say that you have no experience. \\n\\nInstead, focus on your strengths. \\n\\n26. At the end of the interview, ask the interviewer for his or her contact information. \\n\\nThis way, you can send a thank you email.\\n\\nThat is what I believe is a smart strategy for a job interview.

I am 2 months into working at an R&D facility in a Fortune 500 company. This job is VERY detail-oriented and focused on manufacturing. The issue comes in with the fact that I am struggling with all of the details and catching mistakes. Many of these mistakes are like switching around/ writing down numbers, not realizing when something looks wrong, etc... A lot of the data I am producing is being seen by global and regional leaders so when I am making these \\\"little errors\\\"  they are being scrutinized by leaders in the company.\\n\\n There are other interns and they seem to be catching on much quicker than me so that shows me that this is a personal, not an executive issue. I have no complaints about the management they have been so patient with me and are very easygoing. They genuinely seem to want to help me out. This being said I have been put on a PIP since I am not where I need to be. I am working hard to improve but every time I leave work and think I double-checked everything, I am wrong. \\n\\n I do have ADHD and have always struggled with this to the point where I see it everywhere in my day-to-day life.  I have tried to make task lists and write down all my mistakes no matter if I catch them on my own. I am improving however very very slowly since I need to re-train my brain for this attentiveness. This is causing a lot of extra work for my managers trying to explain my mistakes to higher-ups and trying to help me improve.\\n\\n I genuinely have the best intentions and feel that I am working hard, but it's gotten to the point where it is playing to my weaknesses and not my strengths. I have realized this is not the field for me, despite this I want to be the best intern possible until the end of my contract. I don't know how to react to this and I feel like a failure. I have gotten in my head about it so much that I am nervous to go to work. Additionally, being such an anxious person I feel like this is the world telling me that I will never succeed. I know I am working myself up way too much about this but I can't help it. Has anyone been on either side of this situation before? Or have any advice for engineers with ADHD?

I am currently employed full-time at a company that has a mandatory weekly office day and working hours are flexible. Job requirements between current and new job are similar, but new job would have more client facing responsibility. I have also been in the industry for 2.5-3 years and was referenced this open position, so they know I\\u2019m cut out for the job. Interviews also went amazing and it\\u2019s clear that they like me personality wise enough to fit with the team. \\n\\nThis past month, the recruiter and reporting managers for this new position mentioned that 2 days would be required in office which I was fine with since my current job has a mandatory weekly office day. I even recall asking which specific days of the week to get a sense of the work schedule. The team I would be joining is very small and mostly spread out across 3+ countries, so I can imagine most team meetings would take place virtually. \\n\\nThen, upon reading my contract, I noticed that it mentioned I need to be in office for a min of 3 days and that travel may be expected from me time to time. This honestly confused me since we discussed general details about the work schedule/requirements throughout the interview process, and there was never any mention of travelling so not sure what that entails. I have extremely bad travel anxiety and I would have never considered a job that required this in the first place. \\n\\nAfter skimming the contact, I reached out to the recruiter and HR contact on the thread mentioning that the hybrid schedule was advertised as 2 days and implied that this would be a step down from my current work accommodation. They replied saying this was non-negotiable and I\\u2019m considering reaching out to the reporting manager for my team for more clarification on why this has changed and if there is room for flexibility. \\n\\nMain reason for job searching in the first place is that I would love to get a significant salary raise this year and that is currently only possible if I switch companies in the near future - internal raises as we know are not that high. A big attractive factor for this new job was the fact that they advertised just 2 days in office since my mental health is significantly better working a hybrid schedule with 3-4 WFH days and I\\u2019m infinitely more productive. As much as a salary boost would be amazing, I don\\u2019t want to sacrifice my happiness with changing my current work life/balance - small ask, I know. \\n\\nSo depending on what the reporting manager for this job says I\\u2019m going to make either of the following decisions. \\n\\nIf they mention that 2 office days is fine and no travel is required, I\\u2019d asked to get this in writing and likely accept the revised offer. \\n\\nIf they mention that 3 office days in-fact non-negotiable and travel is a possibility, I\\u2019m considering providing two counter-offers:\\n\\n1.  Begrudgingly accept the 3 day in office requirement, but request a 5-10% salary bump on top their original offer. Request to remove the travel requirement entirely. \\n\\n2.  Push back on wanting the 2 day in office requirement that was originally advertised and mention that I would be willing to stay at the current offered salary if this was met. Also request to remove any travel requirement. \\n\\nWould these be reasonable counter offers? I understand that they can always rescind or decline, but I feel like I have enough leverage with my skill set and the fact that even if I don\\u2019t get this job, I\\u2019m still employed with my current company.

My point in sharing this is because I didn't necessarily want this to be my career path. But it kind of fit my personality and interests (cars/computers). Here is basically how the last decade+ of my life has been:\\n\\n**Work Experience:**\\n\\nI started as a temp building police radios for Motorola. Then was moved to a warehouse picker (forklift) because I assembled shit too quickly for the assembly line to keep up with, lol. After that company, I then moved to another company as a customer service rep in Ocean containers, then became the dispatch manager/customer service manager for that company for a couple years. I literally ran this company, it was a small one. I even did their accounting. After I left that company, I wanted to get more experience in the industry so I took a job at an Airfreight/LTL trucking company for a few years, and was a dispatcher there.  I left that company and joined a trucking company that worked in Tradeshows. I became the tradeshow coordinator for huge tradeshows at America's largest convention centers/shows (SEMA, TwitchCon, ShotShow, RSNA, CES, etc.)  and was very good at it because I'm anal and detail oriented and think/plan according to what could go wrong before it does go wrong. I say this with confidence that I don't believe they will ever beat my records for the shows that I did. I made them a ton of money with the contracts I got for them. COVID happened and that was that. Since COVID, I have been a driver, doing Courier work.  I think it's safe to say I really know what I'm doing in the logistics world and have faced just about any problem you could imagine and resolved it.  At every single one of these companys, I was the \\\"Go-To\\\" guy whenever big problems needed addressing/resolving. I've got perfect ratings as a courier too.\\n\\nOutside of actual work experience, growing up poor I have always fixed my own cars, home problems, computer problems, and am very tech savvy. If you've ever watched the movie \\\"Joy,\\\" what her life was like, is what my life has been since I graduated high school. But I grew up on computers because we couldn't afford to go out. I'm good with my hands, i figure out how things work, and have taught myself how to do a lot of shit like soldering, using tools, building stuff, refinishing, refurbishing, etc. I can't afford to take my stuff to a technician so I have to fix them myself, that's how it's always been and honestly it taught me a lot.\\n\\n**What I need help with:**\\n\\nThe problem with this industry is that it has never paid me well. The pay was always just *barely* past \\\"surviving,\\\" where I live. I never got paid on commission, only hourly/salary, and never over 50k a year, with all that experience.\\n\\n**One side of me wants to leave the industry entirely and give up on it because company's don't pay. But at the same time, I know that there** ***are*** **people who make a decent living off this. I just don't know what angle I should pursue next. I have always pursued further education/experience in the industry, and now I'm at a point where it's like the knowledge I've gained in my time here, is transferable amongst other angles of the field. Like for example I could easily slide into a company that delivers cars, or produce. I haven't necessarily done exactly that before, but the previous knowledge will easily transfer is my point. I've dipped my feet into everything.**\\n\\nWorking in this industry with limited vacations and barely taking days off has started to take a toll on me and I'm getting burnt out. I really don't know which approach to take next. My reasons for leaving companies was ***always*** pay. They would make promises that they'd increase my pay in the beginning and always give excuses as to why they can't pay more in the end. Frankly I'm tired of it. I'm tired of knowing more than my bosses, and being better at their jobs than they are (from a leadership standpoint too). I'm tired of making those guys rich. I'm not trying to be arrogant but it's actually the truth. When I leave companies, they start getting negative ratings. It's because I try to do best for the customer and my colleagues, which I've found to be rare in this industry.\\n\\nSo my reason for this post is, if you were me, what would you do next? Please consider that I have been in this industry for years, barely surviving (no savings), and cannot afford to go to school to pursue further education.  I am doing courier work now, and still barely surviving.\\n\\nAny help would be appreciated.\\n\\nIf you are a recruiter please do not DM me and spare me with any advertisements.

The second was a suggestion to get more involved in different types of work (which hadn't been mentioned to me until the review, essentially, and was never brought up). To my knowledge before this review, I was performing as expected.

Overall I enjoy the role but am not interested in still being in this role passed 4-5 years. \\nMy issue with the role is mainly the Pto situation and the on call system. First there is no Pto structure here, if I want to take off I can take off but no one will cover for me. The 4 days I have taken in the last year have consisted of me receiving work calls the entire day. I\\u2019m Not talking 1-2 I\\u2019m talking 30+. This is basically the same with my boss.  My wife and I want to start a family soon and I don\\u2019t want to be harassed when I need to take a day off. From what I can see this situation does not get better until you leave the operations side of the company. Next I am not a fan of the on call system. Since we are a gas company we have leaks/emergency\\u2019s. I am on call once every 5 weeks but even when I\\u2019m not on call I still get calls at all hours for mostly pointless stuff. \\nSo there is the situation, the questions I have for y\\u2019all are:\\n1. In your experience are all operations management roles like this? If not what field have you experienced?\\n2. Are all propane companies like this? I work for one of the top 3 companies and have been curious about smaller companies. \\n3. Lastly does it seem like I am being underpaid? I cant seem to figure out what a role like this should garner.\\n\"", "title": "Should I switch industries or look for a better company structure?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1balbvo/should_i_switch_industries_or_look_for_a_better/"}, {"author": "AKindNitroKid", "created_utc": 1709970463.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 5, "post_id": "1bacfkz", "score": 3, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"\\nAn employee in our agency is seeking advice from me regarding his raise.

I worked my way up from a grocery clerk to a Frozen Dept.Manager to Dairy/Frozen Manager over the course of just a few years until my store was unfortunately sold and shut down.  I worked a year in a grocery warehouse as a pallet picker until I learned that a new grocery store was opening near me.  I applied and was thrilled to see that it was my old Manager from my original store who would be running this new one.  He instantly hired me, but it was for a Dairy/Frozen Clerk, not a Manager, because they had a 40 year grocery vet filling that role, and my one other new coworker was also a Dairy/Frozen Manager at his last job meaning my entire department was made up of previous Department Managers.  Fast forward 2 years and my Dept.Manager was promoted to Assistant Store Manager, leaving the Department Lead position open.  Needless to say me and my co-worker (Now my best friend after working together since the store opened) both applied for the position, and after almost a week of interviews and waiting it was decided that he would receive the promotion, not me due to him having managment experience from multiple departments in the past and not just Dairy/Frozen.  We went out for drinks to celebrate and made sure we were both cool with the new situation and not harboring any bad feelings about how it turned out.  Fast forward a couple weeks and I learned that my store is hiring for a Front End Manager position which would come with a 3 dollar per hour raise bumping me from 21 per hour to 24 per hour and eventually 26 per hour after two more years.  Upper management is pushing me very hard to apply for the position, implying that they want me to have it and would rather not post the job publicly.  I was even approached by two of the other front end Managers asking me if I'd be interested in the position and trying very hard to convince me to take it.  I feel very conflicted because all I've ever known is Dairy/Frozen.  I always imagined myself being a Manager in that department for my entire career, but now that my co-worker got it I won't have the opportunity to move up for several years at the earliest.  Should I take the Front End Management job that pays much more but I'm not as familiar or passionate about? Or should I stay in my current position and just do what I'm familiar with for less? I think I know in my heart that the right answer is to take the promotion, not only because of the massive pay raise, but it would also diversify my resume so I could potentially earn a Dairy/Frozen Manager job in the future when we expand to another new location.  Does anyone have any advice or experience with a similar situation? I only have one night to think about it before they post the job to the public.

My end career goal is to work in the Live News industry, I have made an effort and have connected with a few people inside of the News industry - I ideally would like to be in a video editing position, but also I am quite of a geek when it comes to computers and tech so I would also like to be a broadcast engineer for the news industry. \\n\\nDuring my time in the film industry I've noticed a heavy majority is contract work, to which I'd rather have a permanent position - and noticed News companies (although they do have contractors) tend to have more permanent positions.\\n\\nNow, back to my current stage and would like guidance on. I wouldn't know, If I wanted to be heading towards the news industry, to carry on getting film jobs (to which I have had a great struggle at finding), graduating from university with a communications/networking degree (computing degree for 3-4 years), Joining the Army (minimum 4 years but they provide you apprenticeships if you want to have a signal Corp roles (cyber engineer - British army) then to join the news industry with qualifications gained, or even to just try and find apprenticeships (which is almost as hard for me to find jobs). \\n\\nI'm not sure which route would be best, keynote: I have a girlfriend of already 4 years to which lives in another country - I ideally would like to leave the UK to migrate and live with her as I believe the costs / affordability is way too expensive to live here. With her plans, she's going to university and would likely graduate in about 4 years time. \\n\\nMy own thoughts, if I continue with jobs it will always be a cat and mouse game finding job to job. If I go to university, I do gain great qualifications but it's a problem with student loans (yes I only pay if I earn over a certain amount but a loan is still a loan) and probably won't have money in the time I would like to move out or even migrate. I have been considering the army for a few years but of course there's a risk of my life being cut short, and with the way politics are you never know what's coming in the next few years; but if all is fine in the end, I'd have a lot of money just simply saving since there's almost no expenses and ideally I'd have qualifications too. If I go down the apprenticeship route, I'd definitely need more help finding courses for me, I wouldn't know how to find a lot of apprenticeships and not sure if the majority of them are paid courses or not (as in I have to pay to be a part of apprenticeships).\\n\\nAny help anyone? \\n\\nIf you need more questions answered then let me know I'll be more than happy to answer.\\n\\nThanks all for the read,\\n\\nANY HELP PLEASE.\\n\"", "title": "19M looking for guidance", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b9xk1n/19m_looking_for_guidance/"}, {"author": "JustAChickenStrip", "created_utc": 1709914021.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 2, "post_id": "1b9rp5s", "score": 2, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"I 29F started out going to school for Graphic Design and Illustration (I know, I know).

It can be mind numbingly boring, projects move at a snails pace due to bureaucracy and even when it's busy the work itself is not stimulating for me. I've been applying to other departments in government but the hiring process is extremely slow and competitive so it hasn't resulted in anything in the 2 years I've been looking.

I could sell it and rent something more affordable (difficult in Ontario's housing market) but I feel like I'd be shooting myself in the foot by getting out of the market now that I'm in it. I can afford the full amount of the tuition for the programs I'm looking at now, I just can't keep up with everything else without my current income.\\n\\nSecond, is that the art industry is extremely competitive and does not pay all that well, at least for entry level. I think I would be taking a 20-30k pay cut, but it may be worth it to do something I'm passionate about.

At the same time, bc there have been issues, it's a chance for me to make changes that will make my job easier next year, if he implements them. The piece he followed went well. The piece that he didn't follow, though, garnered complaints from our stakeholders. This, combined with low engagement from the stakeholders, makes me wonder if he doubts himself and is leaning on me.\\n\\nIn Week 3, he asked for more feedback on a different process. I gave it to him, with a clear description and examples. In Week 4, he asked if we could meet to revise. I told him I didn't have the time, but sketched out a solution and advised him of the issues in it that I wasn't sure how to resolve and he could do what he wanted with it. Again, it's not my job.\\n\\nIt's now Week 5, we have to start implementing the process. He emailed me yesterday saying that my co-workers and I could just work off my sketch and design the process, but was also open to any suggestions. My 2 co-workers are new this year and have not done this project before.\\n\\nI sent a frank response. I told him I appreciated his confidence in me, but that, essentially, this is outside my job description and specifically within his. I attached the policy that says so, which I'm not sure if his boss gave him. I also advised that I did not have the time to do as much, anyway, in terms of time and managing the team with coworkers. One of his issues that he himself brought up in his message is that he and his family have been sick the last few weeks. So, at the end of my email, I said I hope everyone recovers and as a parent, who similarly to him, lives away from family, I totally understand that it is hard but eventually will get better once community is built.\\n\\nI thought I kept the mail as neutral as possible and spent 1.5 hours crafting it. We work in a very political environment, with several different nationalities.

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, but medication helps for a while and then stops (we are still titrating, and I am in CBT). Maybe I'm overthinking this bc rumination is an ADHD tendency.

I know my boss would support me (lead has another boss), but I don't want the lead to malign me to his co-workers, who can be my lead on other projects.

She ignored what I showed her and told me I was never supposed to be using it, despite her being the approver for my timesheet and always approving them with those hours. \\n\\nI was also surprised to be accused of \\u201cslacking\\u201d.

I was told this during the same conversation where I was told my performance for the past year is the second highest rating (~20% employees receive) and that a person under me who I had to work tirelessly to have promoted (they deserve it) did go through (happy for them) - to my level. I was told that it was simply because 2 months ago as part of a reorg where I was put onto this new team, my new manager, who this convo was with, was ghosted by my former manager. He said he didn\\u2019t have the words to write or answers to give during calibration sessions to put me forward for promotion, and realized that meant he couldn\\u2019t promote me.  He says he didn\\u2019t know enough about me and wasn\\u2019t getting responses from my old manager. So ultimately an org change out of my control negated a year of very hard work, relationship building with key stakeholders and leaders, and obviously positive results given my rating. \\n\\nThis does not sit well for a myriad of reasons. First, I have 3 current employees working for me at the same level (Sr. Manager) one of whom was laid off as a director last year and brought back in under me with a demotion in title and level, but no change in salary. He is managing one of the 4 programs I am accountable for. I had to have his comp review yesterday where I shared his raise, bonuses, long term incentive and total comp in the 10s of thousands above me. I have 2 more I\\u2019m currently hiring for out of 7 that will be the same level as me and target comp is higher than mine. \\n\\nSecond, the promotion process is months long with many forms to fill out, calibration session to make your case against similar level prospective promotions cross functionally, and back and forth waiting. It\\u2019s clear to me that my former management \\u201chad better or more important things to do\\u201d since I was no longer under their org structure, and my current manager is promoting the people he knows and worked with for a long time over me because he \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t know me.\\u201d So the promotion process and org change effectively cancelled my promotion to director even though it\\u2019s been acknowledged as earned and deserved. \\n\\nThird, my boss told me next promotion cycle (6 months from now) I\\u2019ll be considered again. I\\u2019ve had a lot of carrot dangling happen in my career and somehow find myself back in that spot for the 3rd time (for a promotion to director). He\\u2019s signed me up for some in-house leadership program as a consultation, even though I\\u2019ve clearly shown and demonstrated leadership skills effectively and much more so that I see many other directors whom I work closely with showing.\\n\\nFourth, another reason I was told it is not happening is because I only have 3 employees currently. Soon to be 10. But since I don\\u2019t have that bigger team yet, they won\\u2019t promote me yet. This is bologna. I work with 3-4 director on a daily basis who have 0 employees under them. There is no requirement like this. \\n\\nLastly, I was hired to do strategy work and somehow  find myself leading multiple very large programs because I stuck my neck out and contributed where I didn\\u2019t need to.

This is mainly due to being undiagnosed ADHD for most of my life, which meant school was difficult, and I spent a lot of my life thinking I was stupid and not trying. It took my seven years to finish my bachelor's degree, I spent a lot of my 20s traveling and teaching English in different countries. I finally settled in the USA around the age of 30 and got a 'real job'. \\n* I know I am accountable for my own career and path - but navigating it has always been 10x harder due to being ND. I'm not looking to argue this with anyone, but that's the reason. I'm in therapy, receiving treatment, and the first year after I received treatment, I received glowing reviews for my improvements at work. I'm never going to have a job I'm enthusiastic about due to my ADHD - I just want a job that I can tolerate, so I can enjoy life on my own time. \\n* This promotion is extremely valuable to me, and will be key to me getting out of the 'entry-level customer service' trap that many find themselves in. I understand that this is a great opportunity and I'm extremely grateful for it. \\n* I'm worried about coming off as ungrateful, but I know if I phrase it correctly and approach it in the right way, I won't. You don't get what you don't ask for, right? Worst that can happen is I'm told 'no'.  No one is going to advocate for me, that is up to me. \\n* I have already accepted the position, so I may have screwed myself in that respect.  \\n\\n\\nAny advice on how to navigate and approach this?  \\n\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\"", "title": "Interim Promotion, No Raise", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b82lss/interim_promotion_no_raise/"}, {"author": "vittorioe", "created_utc": 1709720671.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1b7weyl", "score": 6, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"I\\u2019m waiting to hear back from a recent interview, but otherwise my prospects are not obvious at all and I\\u2019m not keen on the \\u201cspray and pray\\u201d method of job applying if I can help it.

Luckily, my family didn't throw me out of the house because of my sexual orientation or my religious beliefs (I'm not religious) because, according to them, they still \\\"love me\\\", but they are still homophobic (especially my mother, my father is much less homophobic and he even had a gay male person as a friend and schoolmate, but he is still not entirely in favor of me having a different sexual orientation although he rarely expresses it) and my mother is resentful that I abandoned Catholicism. Maybe she almost never causes me problems because of my sexual orientation (although sometimes she annoys me a little in a notoriously irritating way for not being a religious person like her), but she does because of other things and that is too frustrating (and rarely sometimes she infantilizes my autism in a subtle way, which is, without a doubt, very irritating for me). Anyway, I'm also not entirely open about my sexuality with my parents because of their same homophobic attitudes... Also, I don't really trust them at all, so I'm not entirely open with them anyway.\\n\\nSo, well, I have a conservatively religious mother who is a b&tch that I really hate, a more libertarian conservative father but who still doesn't fully understand me nor does he understand at all how my own feelings work (by the way, my dad also has autism spectrum disorder like me and I still can't believe that we are still both different people) and a centrist semi-closeted lesbian sister with an introverted cold character; very simple, superficial and shallow speech; and with a propensity to get very irritated if someone or something bothers her too much. \\n\\nThe thing is, well... A lot of things have happened since I finished high school in 2020. I don't want to mention details at all. The story is very long, complex and... I just don't feel like telling any of it.\\n\\nThe thing is that I will go back to university this year.  I will study at USAT (Universidad Cat\\u00f3lica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo) here in Chicayo, a private university and the most prestigious in the Lambayeque region (there in the United States there are \\\"states\\\" and here in Peru there are \\\"regions\\\", thank you). My parents cannot pay more than that, they say that me being in other cities is more expensive for them and they prefer that I stay in Chiclayo. My biggest dream (although, at the moment, that dream is impossible, pathetic, impractical, very expensive and very far away from where I currently live right now) is to be a creator, director and writer of animated series and films.  I also want to be a musician and music composer.  And I also want to be a writer, cartoonist and illustrator of my own novels and/or comics... And I would also like to be a film actor.  And, well, my biggest dream is to be an artist, to be recognized, to make a living from my art and to be happy with my art.  I really want to be an artist and I feel like I was born to do it.  However, that dream is impossible now (besides, art degrees are not available in USAT nor in my city... What did you expect? I live in a third-worldist country in a crappy third-worldist provincial city!)... And, well... And now, thinking about it, everything I just said above about my desire to be an artist is completely pathetic and stupid... I guess I will never be happy... Why do I continue living then?\\n\\nAnd, well, there are doctors who make a lot of money and are respected, but I'm not interested in medicine and I'm not interested in working long hours (if I want to help people, I prefer to do it in a different way). There are the engineers who make a lot of money and are respected because they are logical and cold people and not pathetic dreamers like me, but I am not interested in mathematics... Yes, I used to get decent grades in mathematics in school, but I still consider that I have math anxiety and that I hate math. If I have just offended mathematicians for this, I apologize, right now I grant you permission to insult art, colors, shapes and artists, because we artists are dumb and stupid beings who do not easily recognize that we are inferior to STEM people, thank you. Kindergarten, elementary or high school teacher? No, thanks. I wish school teachers good luck, but I am not interested in suffering more than necessary with work, administration, and/or rowdy students, nor am I interested in making less money than I would like to make. Police or army?  No thanks, I'm a weak, sensitive crybaby... Plus I'm not interested in initially earning less money than I would really like to earn. Sex worker? I don't even know where the gay brothels or gay bars are in my city... And although Grindr makes things easier, sex would be completely boring for me (the first and last two times I had sex last year as a bottom I didn't I didn't feel pleasure nor was I attracted to the people who f$cked me which made the sex disappointing)... Also, I wouldn't want to earn less money than I would like to earn nor would I want to suffer sexual abuse, so... No, being a sex worker would not be ideal for me. Studying Audiovisual Communication or Journalism? No thanks, being a journalist doesn't interest me. I am not passionate about telling stories that are not of my creation. I am also not interested in studying Audiovisual Communication since I am not interested in creating live-action films and/or live-action series (in addition, I studied Audiovisual Communication for a while at another university (in the city of Piura in the Piura region... Yes, the names of that one city and that region are the same) before abandoning it... And in the end I abandoned the career for many reasons and one of those reasons is because I did not have a bit of creative control in the audiovisual works that were done in groups... They told me: \\\"it's okay, but that's not how it's done\\\"... URRGH!!!).\\n\\nBusiness administrator? No, I don't think I'm suitable for that career. One of the reasons my semi-closeted lesbian sister chose that career is because she told me in a cold, dry and direct tone of voice: \\\"I love capitalism.\\\" And, well... The thing is that I'm not such a fan of capitalism, to be honest, but hey. And also, on another occasion (maybe last year), while I was with her and her girlfriend in a taxi, she told me in a dry, sarcastic, mocking and provocative tone: \\\"I like my career, because it is focused on finding SOLUTIONS.\\\"  And she said the word \\\"SOLUTIONS\\\" in an even louder and more mocking tone meaning in an implicit tone \\\"you are a useless failure.\\\" Yes, I'm a useless failure. She is right. In addition to the fact that I am not a die-hard fan of capitalism, I am also not interested in managing companies or people in areas that do not interest me or that would not make me happy.  Yes, I want money and I want it no matter what, but... I also want to be happy.  \\n\\nDo I have to be willing to be very unhappy and very miserable to finally have the opportunity to make more money? Do I? :''(\\n\\nAgain, at the university where I am going to study and in my city, there are no art degrees at all.  Furthermore, I have discovered that I would also not like to work in a minimum wage job for life until I die and that is why I decided to return to university with financial help from my father. Also, please, make fun of me for being a useless idler who isn't willing to work a part-time job or two. Yes, I am a useless idler, a hateful failure and a botched abortion for not wanting to suffer working one or two part-time jobs while studying at university, but, for the moment, I do not want to work one or two part-time jobs, because I would like to concentrate better on my studies and because I value my free time a lot. Insult me if you want, humiliate me if you want... You can even say me that I must commit s$&cide for being a burden to society. You have permission to do so.\\n\\nAnd, well, the only option I had left was psychology... A few weeks ago, the pressure to choose a career was great because time was running out so I chose psychology. However, that choice was not a completely random choice. Lately I have had a certain interest in what lies behind human emotions, human behavior and human relationships. Also, some of you may already know me as the Reddit user who asks a lot of questions... So I hope you guys know what I'm talking about. \\n\\nHowever, I'm not sure... Have I chosen my career correctly? Have I? I'm not sure and I'm really scared. I am very afraid.\\n\\nBut hey, the thing is that I will have to endure 5 more years in hell until I can graduate at the end of 2028. From the time between the end of 2028 and the beginning of 2029 I have to take action and get out of that damn shitty place (Chiclayo) forever away from my family in search of my own life... I don't know if I will have to move immediately from Chiclayo, but if there is a chance to leave and have a more comfortable and happy life in another Peruvian city better than Chiclayo, in Lima (the capital and largest city of my own country) or in another part of the world much better than my own country, I would do it.\\n\\nI just want a very happy, comfortable and calm life in the future with many opportunities for people like me. In a place or in a city where I can finally be myself, be free and be able to fulfill my biggest and most cherished dreams in the future (I hope that is possible, but hope is not my strong suit, man). A future where I can get a boyfriend with whom I truly fall in love, with whom I can marry (I hope that one day, in the future, we gays can get married here in Peru) and with whom I can form a family in the future if we both achieve the stability and economic abundance that we dream of achieving so much. If possible, I hope that we can both move out of the country to another place to find a different life where I can finally meet my goals or that I can leave the country to find a different life where I can finally meet my goals and find my future love of my life in that same different place. \\n\\nHowever, that is not possible now, I first have to concentrate on achieving goals here first in Peru, which is the most realistic, pragmatic and convenient plan available for me. However, Latin America is a land where political, social and economic uncertainty is the norm, which is why, personally, I am very afraid and I even wonder if it's really prudent or intelligent for me to think about achieving goals here first in Peru, but hey.\\n\\nAnyway: 1.

Based on patient, peer, and colleague feedback, I feel I have been doing well and I am learning quickly and efficiently, despite having no previous experience in the specialty that I work in. I am seeking advice on how to communicate/ask for positive feedback with the physician I work directly with who is also my boss. Here is the background: I am a very reserved and polite individual who has never needed a \\u2018pat on the back\\u2019 to know I\\u2019m doing a good job, whether it was at school or previously held jobs. I\\u2019m 100% aware that constructive criticism is essential to the learning process and always welcome any type of feedback.

A few examples:\\n1. giving me peer-reviewed research articles to learn from (which is great) but saying that he found articles with \\u2018words that I will understand\\u2019 when the article discusses very simple pathophysiology which I understand or am already familiarized with these concepts before and if I don\\u2019t understand I know where to find reliable resources to clarify explain the concepts\\n2.  during surgery, he will \\u2018pimp\\u2019 me which just refers to doctors asking medical/PA students questions about the procedure/anatomy/pathology to assess knowledge. I usually know the answer and have studied in depth before I go into the surgery, but when I answer incorrectly (which has happened 3 times out of easily over 100 questions he has pimped me on) he gets very upset and yells at me in the operating room and in front of the other staff members instead of having a professional discussion and making it a constructive learning opportunity. It\\u2019s very embarrassing and awkward in front of my colleagues \\n3. asks me to give a detailed report on a patient with specific information regarding the history and exam findings (even if it is not pertinent) and when I do he says that my report is too long and that \\u2018all surgeons have ADD and zone out during report\\u2019. I am always as concise as possible while still including what he requested and keep it under 30 seconds. At least once a week, he will get angry at me for not including a certain piece of information when I very much did include it, but he is usually on his phone when I give report and not paying attention. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t let constructive criticism affect me mentally/emotionally, but after 4 months of never getting positive feedback and the only feedback I do get is condescending, it is beginning to make me less confident in my work and im developing anxiety and avoid asking him any question at all to avoid being berated and embarrassed, which makes me look like I am not interested in learning. I have approached him twice and very respectfully asked if we could have a debriefing once a week about what is working/not working, what I should focus on more, etc because I am still training and I want to do the best job I can for our patients and daily work flow. He says sure but seems uninterested when I try to bring it up at an appropriate time when we are not busy.

When I graduated I did a year in college studying psychology, decided college sucks, and dropped out. Worked retail for 2 years, then got an entry level job in customer service and sales ($10/hr) at a large photo studio company (Many locations across southeast US), eventually transferred over to over to photography department, and became a manager ($19/hr), pretty much doubling my salary in two years. However, we had slow seasons every year, so my salary was more like $36,000. I was a photography manager for a little over a year and a half, so 3.5 years at that company, before I got laid off last month.  Now for the jobs:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nJob A: This guy was a former fighter in a big league (I want to keep things vague but he was making $45k a fight at least), and left that to join the sales team of toy manufacturing company (current annual revenue of \\\\~$30 million). He was there for over 10 years and when he left he was the director of sales for the East Coast of the US (people under him were making $200k/yr so I'd imagine he was making a lot more than that). A few months ago, he left that company to start his own toy manufacturing company. He was able to use relationships from his previous job to get some real good contracts going; he's got licenses with TMNT, Sonic, etc. However, he's unable to keep up with the workload as the only employee, so a mutual friend of ours referred me and I was hired this week as his executive assistant. I make $20/hr to start but he's stated multiple times that number will go up.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nJob B: I got a reply to my application to this job the same day I my friend told me about Job A. It is a photo editor for, coincidentally, a *very* large, international toy company. They are the owners of the best selling toy of the year and are worth at least $100 million. I did very well in my first interview, they told me they'd get back to me in a week, but they got back to me in less than 24 hours. I have a second interview tomorrow and if I had to guess, I think I'll get the job. It pays $60k/year, which is almost *double* the salary I was making at the last job.  With that out of the way, I'd like to list my pros and cons of each job:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Growth:**\\n\\nIn Job A, the potential for growth is crazy. If he can get the company off the ground I could be looking at a 6 figure salary in a few years, which is something I never dreamed of. Meanwhile, at Job B, they said I'd need to spend 1 year in my role before I could transition into another one. However, it's a huge company and they are continuously growing, and the interviewer said that growth is very common in the company.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Freedom:**\\n\\nIn Job A, there's a lot more freedom by nature of it not being a corporation and there only being 2 employees. I had to step out for an hour and a half today and even though I just started, he was totally cool with it and still paid me for when I was gone. I wouldn't have to jump through HR hoops to get time off, if I was a few minutes late cause of traffic it wouldn't be a big deal, etc. Job B is a huge corporation, and I'd imagine small decisions would have to go through multiple people before changes happen, at least that's how it was at my photo studio job which was also corporate. There is benefit to being so large though, as the brand would look great on my resume and it would likely be much more structured and a fun place to work. It's also a lot more stable and less likely to fail (although from what I've seen from Job A it seems unlikely that it won't be profitable).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Career Field:**\\n\\nI know next to nothing about the toy industry, but I do love toys, so it will be cool to get the upper level, insider knowledge on that in Job A. I'll also be able to develop skills I don't have yet as an executive assistant. With that said, Job B is in a field I know I already excel in and have a strong passion for, and have extensive experience working in. I think I would enjoy the projects in Job B more. Job A isn't really a creative job, but he did say  I would be able to work on projects like product photography and packaging design in the future.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Commute and Hours:**\\n\\nJob A's commute is 12-20 minutes depending on traffic. Job B's is 30-45 minutes depending on traffic. However, Job B is 4 days in office, 1 day WFH, 8:30-5:30. For now, Job A is a 9-5, but once I get trained and knowledgeable in the industry, I will be able to decide my own schedule.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Responsibilities:**\\n\\nIn Job A, I'd get more responsibility. He's swamped with building up the company right now so he'll have no choice but to give me some big projects (which he's already said he wants to do once I'm ready) to help with his workload. If the company gets big, I'd likely also get my own team as well and be able to set policies and precedents there.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Team:**\\n\\nIn Job A, it's just me and him for right now. He's a super cool guy, and I like working for him, but unlike me, he doesn't have much interests in the licenses he has and we don't have much in common. Not really a huge con, but most of my friends I've met through work so it'll be a little weird not having that environment. In Job B, I'd likely be surrounded by young creatives who I'd be able to form friendships with and have things in common. By nature of it being a large team though, communication may be difficult as opposed to working directly with the only other employee in the company who is also my boss.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Pay and Benefits:**\\n\\nJob A is $20/hr which is \\\\~$20k/yr less pay than Job B's $60k/year for now. If it picks up though, I could be making a whole lot more than Job B. Both jobs are higher than my \\\\~$36k/yr at my last job though. Because Job A's company has just started, he doesn't have any payroll or quickbooks or anything set up, so there are currently no benefits, but I've been told they will be coming in the future. Job B has 2 weeks paid vacation with it going up a week every year. There are also 9 sick days (I've never worked in a job with limited sick days, but I rarely get sick so I don't think this will matter). Health insurance is 100% paid for by them, but I don't know if it's any good and I'm pretty happy with my current insurance anyway.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy friends aren't sure which one to pick either and think I'll be happy in either one, but I don't want to regret the decision as it's going to affect the rest of my life. I'm losing sleep and my appetite over which job to pick lol. Solid advice my friends have told me is that I can probably nail a corporate job in the future, but unlikely to have an opportunity like Job A again. On the other hand, Job B was the 25th application I did and was the only one who reached out with an interview, so I don't know how easily I could get a job like this again. One friend who used to be my boss said I would probably be a better fit for the less strict Job A, compared to the HR and paperwork of Job B. Other friends have stated that working for a recognizable brand like Job B is super cool (and tbh I do think it would be cool to say \\\"I work for Job B\\\"), and likely comes with some cool perks like previews at new toys before they're out, working with licenses I love, and maybe even getting free toys.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR: I've got 2 really good jobs lined up, Job A, which doesn't pay too much right now but has the potential to make me a lot in the future, and Job B, which is in a field I love and has above average pay, but in a corporate environment.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI'm really stressing over this choice so any insight you could provide is much appreciated, thank you.\"", "title": "Having a really hard time picking between 2 great career opportunities", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b7oly2/having_a_really_hard_time_picking_between_2_great/"}, {"author": "Pace_Fluid", "created_utc": 1709705749.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1b7so8m", "score": 1, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"Hi all, \\n\\nI applied for a company in a data analyst position.

I do have an interest in technology, and have done some very minimal coding in python and I don't mind it, however, I just don't think I have the brains to do all those classes that come with a bachelors of science. I didn't do pre-calculus in high school and all the universities in my province require pre-calculus 12, but to have pre-calculus 12 I need to do pre-calculus 11. I have enrolled to do pre-calculus 11 online but I just don't understand it. It's also so hard to do the online pre-calculus class after working all day, going to the gym, cooking dinner, still having some chill time and have a bit of social life. It also doesn't help that I just don't understand it. I know it's an excuse, but it's rough lol. The only main reason I've been thinking about computer science to be honest is because it's a good career field. I like technology, I like that a lot of the roles are remote, and the income is good. I can start at my local college, but I would need to have both math courses done before September. I think if i really focused and reduced my hours a bit at work I could possibly do it, but if I'm struggling this much with high school pre-calculus, 4 years of university doing harder stuff (university calculus, chemistry, etc.) will probably be rough. But, I think I could do it if I really tried.

The course has quite a lot of coding type courses, but also has a business emphasis which is interesting to me. I do also have all the requirements for this program so I don't need to do anything extra. My only concern is how employable the degree will be and how much I may struggle to find a job with this degree (though I may struggle to find a job in general). Though, from what I've seen, it seems once you have experience in the tech field experience is preferred over your degree. I also feel like I may regret not getting a computer science degree instead. But, I don't know if I even really like coding.\\n\\n  \\nLately, I have been thinking about maybe going into political science to become a policy analyst or something similar. I actually am quite interested in politics/world affairs/history and I enjoy writing and doing research type projects or things. I don't want to dox myself, but I work for an indigenous band office and currently have two years experience there as an administrative assistant. I am not indigenous, but I have been quite involved growing up with indigenous events/protocols as my sister-in-law is indigenous who I am very very close with. I have noticed a lot of indigenous organizations hire policy analyst and having almost three years experience working for a band office may give me a bit of an advantage. I have however learned recently that actually for a majority of policy analyst roles/jobs they accept political science degrees or business administration degrees. My local college apparently has an amazing business program and I think I would actually enjoy going to school for a business degree. But, once again, I am worried about job prospects for either a political science degree or business degree.\\n\\n  \\nI have also thought about going into a trade, maybe become an electrician or work in HVAC but I just don't think I am cut out for the blue collar life LOL.\\n\\n  \\nReally, all I want is a job that pays well and allows me to have a good work life balance (not having to work 10 hours a day, having a consistent 8-4 job). Though, I guess everyone probably wants that. I would ideally like to make 70k-90k a year. I would LOVE to make 100k-150k+ a year if possible, I actually would really like to make 150k-200k a year at some point if possible. I honestly feel like social media has really ruined my perception of money. I use to think I wanted to get a coding job making 250k+ a year working remotely working 35 hours a week, but I have realized just how uncommon that is and only a very few lucky individuals get that opportunity. It seem everything online nowadays says you need to make 200k-300k a year, but honestly making 80k a year is super good and I realistically would like to make that.

I don\\u2019t mean the occasional disagreement more so an attack on my ability to maintain the facility accompanied by screaming. This stems from two things. Firstly a lack of decisiveness from the board to either renovate or shut down a pool (which has people in an uproar) as well as a cut in funding resulting in sports leagues having less money for refs resulting in lower quality refs. Which causes people to cuss and scream at me as I am not managing the league adequately. Due to this I no longer feel this company is worth working for. \\n\\nI have an MBA, 3 years marketing experience and 2 years management experience. I currently make 50k in rural Michigan. I would like to stay in Michigan and move into a full time marketing role but I need help creating and exit strategy. \\n\\nSide question is this normal? Do other people experience community members telling them no one likes them, they should go die, and scream at them every day? All with no support to remove these people from management as we are a community facility. \"", "title": "How do I create an exit strategy?

The new position's cap would be 141k.\\n\\nNow, I did agree with him on a couple things he mentioned about my group vs the potential new group. He said I could get pigeon holed since the new position has the need for something pretty specific, whereas my current position offers pretty broad opportunities for growth. He also claimed that the new group is onsite all the time (although the company does offer 50% remote). My work life balance is important to me right now, but if I'm making significantly more money and working on something I'm passionate about(which I would be) I can try to balance coming on site more. \\n\\nAnyways, there's more context I can provide if asked but my question is, do you think my boss is just trying to keep me and deter me from looking elsewhere? Is this new opportunity actually better for me? Especially since I plan on leaving before 3 years, it makes logical sense to me to maximize the money I make. But I know it's also important to weigh every factor. So, ask me questions or provide your insights please.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"", "title": "Do I stay or go?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b76pue/do_i_stay_or_go/"}, {"author": "Low_Function248", "created_utc": 1709662761.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1b7cb4m", "score": 1, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"internship \\\\* \\n\\nhi, i am currently pursuing a BBA.

When I joined my company, i was working on a platform that was accessible (I am a blind screen-reader user), and I could get a lot done. I had some huge improvements, and that department still remembers me because I was one of the main developers. Most of them were performance fixes or huge quality of life fixes that made the lives of internal employees better.\\nI was moved around a bit, and ran into accessibility issues, which lead to me being fairly slow to get tickets complete, and also progress like I want. Recently, I've started resolving a lot of these issues. I found the right connections and time to let me spend time filing accessibility bug reports, as well as help organize and put priority on these tickets, and then work closely with the dev mostly doing all the accessibility fixes on the frontend to provide advice, testing, and most importantly to thank her, because she is the reason I'm gaining my job confidence back.\\nI'm working on fairly large issues again, and making really great progress in learning the new codebase and contributing. I'm also working on networking across the company so that I have more contacts and resources, can have more of an impact across the company, and can help move initiatives forward with regard to DEI as it includes accessibility.\\n\\nAs my side job, I am co-managing a team of 8 contractors that I worked closely with my co-director to recruit, hire, onboard and provide constant training and feedback for. I schedule one-on-ones once a month with them, and I've received great feedback so far; from the recruitment being one of the best they've done to us being great managers to work for. Our turn-over rate is really low. I believe this is a combination of willingness to advocate for them with the company they are contracted through, as well as spending time to provide one-on-one mentorship and help as needed. This part is particularly easy for me because I love working with each of them, and if I'm proud of anything, it's how much the team has grown.\\n\\nThe team also uses a portal that I built specifically for this work, using Django. The cool thing about this is I can iterate as we have business needs, and it works to deliver what we need in terms of time tracking, task management and timesheet generation.\\n\\nI'm also working on building out an app geared toward mental health that market research has shown will be really useful. I am doing all the back-end work for this, devops, and most of the front-end as well. I plan to hire someone with working eyeballs to make it look good, but my goal is to turn over a fully complete app and let them touch it up with colors, graphics and animations.\\n\\nI have two questions with my novel out of the way. First, what resources can I lean on to build and become stronger? I'm always reading articles on software development, joining talks, listening to videos and anything else I can. I also started reading books on management when we onboarded our contract workers because I really want to try to do the best I can there. Some people talk about a coach or mentor, and I'd really love to find someone I can bounce ideas off of/chat with in my field outside my current company.\\n\\nFinally, I'm really curious where I go from here. I feel like I've hit a point where I'm struggling to find goals or things to work on. Not because I think I'm the best or the top of my field by far, and more because 2 years ago I would've never invisioned myself co-managing a team like this, working with the company directly and having the impact that we do. I'm really interested to find some paths or ideas I can start working toward that will have a meaningful impact on my career and my progression and would love any advice or tips.\"", "title": "Software dev looking to level up/improve", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b65d2s/software_dev_looking_to_level_upimprove/"}, {"author": "Sea-Device-6442", "created_utc": 1709538677.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1b65cft", "score": 1, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"\\\\-I'm an infj, empath, highly sensitive person \\n\\n\\\\-I'm a marxist lol \\n\\n\\\\-I enjoy children and elders but need more mental stimulation for the long term\\n\\n\\\\-currently majoring in environmental politics \\n\\n\\\\-I love mental stimulation but above all I must be doing something that is deeply impactful and emotionally fulfilling.

Well, that crumbled when I destroyed my shoulder which required multiple surgeries.\\n\\nSo, there I was in a sling trying to figure out what to do next. For some reason the prospect of teaching was the first thing that ever interested me. I was always great in English and history, not to mention that working with kids sounded like a difficult but rewarding experience. Yet,  just a couple years have passed and so quickly everything has changed. \\n\\nI currently still live near the university with my wife whom I married this past June. We met in high school  and she is not only an absolute knockout  but an exceedingly hard worker. She finished nursing school a bit before I graduated and has been working at the hospital for the last 10 months ($32-$45/hr ish depending on a few factors). Meanwhile, I have been working as an auditor for Courtyard for $19 per hour.\\n\\nThe job was great while in school, but now my wife and I want to move back home which is 4 hours away. I am desperate for a better job to start supporting my new small family. I have been looking for a job there for about 3 months and haven't had much luck. I've applied to hotel positions as I have worked in hotels since I was 15, and the prospect of a career in hospitality doesn't sound too bad. I am also working on my teaching certification but in the mean time, I need a new job. Hell, if I end up liking it maybe I can teach later on in my career. Lastly, I could go the safest route which is as a fishing guide for my dad's small business. The work is tough, and I would spend a ton of time away from home, but the compensation is pretty good.\\n\\nMy wife has about 20k saved to my 5k. I have a car that's about half paid off that I would like to sell or trade in for a cheaper truck (my current vehicle is much too sporty for the more rugged area we are moving). I am learning how God damn difficult it is to get started but honestly, I know I'm already pretty damn lucky at the end of the day. I just want nothing more than to put my head down and start making as much money and working  possible. I have no issues working, and the dream one day is that my wife can return back to school and get her masters. \\n\\nThe meat and potatoes: With this degree, I am finding it very difficult to find any jobs with relatable experience. It's also hard for me to answer the \\\"how much do you think you should make?\\\" Question from employers. I know that I bust ass and help my coworkers and that I am a person who can pick up day-to-day operations quickly. However, I am young, inexperienced in most fields, and lacking reccomendations in relevant areas. Most of the time,  I say an amount on the lower end of their pay range. If any of you could drop some advice, I'd appreciate it. I'm really trying to branch out to other areas and apply for anything that interests me. The area we hope to move to is where we are both originally from, and the cost of living is fairly high. I've been looking primarily for jobs that pay 45,000-70,000 per year. An income in that range should allow us to live very comfortably for the foreseeable future. I am just so torn with what to do. While I feel like the skills and certifications I possess are worth something, I just don't really know how high I can realistically shoot right now and still stand a chance. If I ditch the guiding and stick with getting my teaching certification while still pursuing a potential separate career, am I damned to work at minimum wage?

I'm currently facing a challenging situation and could really use some advice or suggestions. I'm a 26-year-old (turning 27 in May) working as a Scientist in Analytical R&D for a reputable Pharmaceutical MNC. I completed my Post Grad in November 2021 and started working in January 2022. Despite performing well in my job, I'm losing interest in both work and life in general. The routine feels monotonous, with little to no work-life balance. I come home just to sleep, and this cycle repeats for 5-6 days a week.\\n\\nMy main concern is that I feel undervalued and undercompensated for my work. Despite being rated as a 'High Performer' in two appraisals, I'm only earning 25k INR per month. I don't anticipate a significant raise in the upcoming appraisal either. I'm also skeptical about the future career growth in my current role. While the pharmaceutical industry offers stability, I see limited opportunities for advancement or higher pay. It's frustrating to feel like I'm not fairly rewarded for the profit my company makes from my efforts.\\n\\nI'm exploring opportunities for a career switch, preferably in a life science-related field, where I can receive fair compensation and better prospects for growth. On a personal level, my parents, who were both teachers in a small private school, are retired, and my grandmother requires care due to health issues. Their combined pension of 4.5k isn't enough to cover expenses, especially with my current salary. We don't have any ancestral property, and my parents' savings have been depleted by loans for our modest home. I don't have siblings either and am a single child.\\n\\nI feel a sense of urgency to improve our financial situation and provide my parents with the comfortable life they deserve, especially considering their declining health. Despite attempting various banking/government exams, I haven't been successful. This adds to my anxiety, and I'm unsure about what steps to take next. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your understanding and support.

I could've become a research scientist but the country where I'm from, it's really difficult to make a good living out of that job unless you're like a mega genius.

About 30% of my income is based on an annual bonus, which is paid based on performance. Good or great performance, I get a bit more than the target 30%, poor performance I get less or nothing.  \\n\\nEach year my reviews have been positive and I was paid my full bonus.

Feedback on my performance was positive and I was told I was doing what I needed to be doing. In fact, we had a couple of really big wins towards the tail end of the year that helped the whole company meet its numbers for the year. \\n\\nThe new person came on in late Oct first as a contractor and then as the new department head in Nov.

He further explained that some of the feedback he had received from others in the company had not been positive, although he wouldn\\u2019t provide any details on what feedback or from who. He stated he was willing to \\u201clean in\\u201d and help me address the issue, if I was willing to myself, or that I should leave the company. \\n\\nI left it at that for the time being, as I was pretty upset and didn\\u2019t want to get into an emotional discussion.\\n\\nI now have a real issue to sort through.

Since then, it has been an up and down rollercoaster of emotions -- essentially, I was hired under the impression I would be doing a certain set of things, but after hire I realized I only do these things for a small fraction of my time in the office, and a majority of my day is focused on phone calls and interfacing with potential clients. I know this is a common thing, especially in entry-level office positions, so I wasn't necessarily shocked. I decided to stay and give it a shot, but unfortunately due to my boss' unstable moods and lack of consistent tasks or guidance, I'm deciding to move on.\\n\\n  \\nSo, here's the deal. I interviewed for a position that is more concise and focused, doing tasks that are within my skill set and more enjoyable than what I'm doing currently. This place called me the day after the interview, offering more than what they advertised for. I told them I am definitely interested, but would like to think about it over the weekend (I knew I would say yes anyway). They sent me some hiring paperwork in the meantime, as I have a background check to do before official employment, and within this hiring paperwork is the document that needs to be filled out by a previous/current employer -- essentially just an employment verification document. Is it in bad taste for me to ask my boss to fill this out when I put in my two weeks? \"", "title": "Leaving after 6 months", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b4vcej/leaving_after_6_months/"}, {"author": "Ligerowner", "created_utc": 1709404049.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 2, "post_id": "1b4v01t", "score": 1, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"I recently received an offer and the preamble to it felt a little unusual. The in-house recruiter called me to indicate the hiring manager was prepared to offer a good salary for me and fair by my research, but about 8% below the rate I'd asked for). She asked if I'd be inclined to accept it before they make the full, formal written offer. I told them I'd need a full description of the potential offer in writing to consider before indicating a decision either way - the recruiter sent me an informal email with the details.\\n\\nI ended up countering for a salary that split the difference. The next day, the recruiter called me to say they were prepared to meet the counter, but directly asked me to confirm that I would accept this offer when it came and that I wouldn't use it to get a counter-offer from my current employer. Apparently this was something the hiring manager asked her to ask me.\\n\\nIt strikes me as rather naive of the hiring manager to ask me to confirm those things. To me, verbal agreements don't really mean anything in this context (apart from whether I'm willing to break them or not). Alternatively, it might go the other way and he's trying to make me feel compelled to accept once I have the offer.\\n\\nI guess what I'm asking is - does this raise any concerns?
