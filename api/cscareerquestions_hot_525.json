I been looking to get another job for some time now without success.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI've been working at a very small company for a long time, is the type that takes on various types of projects with different technologies. Initially, I viewed this as a positive thing, but over time, I've come to realize that I may have made a mistake as I feel I haven't specialized in anything specific. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nFor the past few years, most of the projects I've been working on are in ASP.NET Core. My coding is not perfect, but I always try to follow best practices, follow SOLID, and constantly take courses to refresh and improve my skills. I try to promote the adoption of new technologies that could also provide us with a long-term advantage. I advocated for the transition from .NET Framework to .NET Core. But I miss having other devs or a superior to talk about or to help review the code quality.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThere are certain things that are very difficult to implement in my current company. However, I see that these skills are demanded in practically all job offers. For example, following AGILE/SCRUM methodologies, TDD, Clean Architecture, AWS/Azure, also I don't have 'real projects' knowledge of things like Redis, Elk, React/Angular...

While I don't blame my company, I've found it challenging to implement these due things like 'there is no time', 'there is no budget', or 'there are technical limitations'.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI've been told that regardless of my programming abilities, my experience with the complete development cycle of an application is very limited.

The other five positions I've held have been CS-related. To get my current position after being laid off from my previous one, I had to send out nearly 1000 applications and do tens of interviews. In the end, I received two offers. The one I accepted has been amazing and is the best job I've had so far.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nHowever, during my job search, I had friends from outside of the industry also looking for work. I understand that the salaries we earn in the CS field may justify some of the differences in the job search process. However, the differences seemed quite drastic. For people in other fields, the likelihood of getting a given job is so high that they may mention applying to a single job before hearing anything back. This difference in mindset seems to be justified because those same friends will update me on how that single job they applied for scheduled an interview with them or how they received a call back after sending out a second application. Before I know it, they will have a start date for a new position after a handful of applications that seem to have a very high application-to-interview ratio.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nOf course, pay is a significant factor. In my age bracket, my pay is higher than average. So, I would make somewhere between two to four times more money than my peers typically will at their jobs. However, it still feels odd when you look at the numbers. On paper, in the case scenario where someone can land a $20-$25 an hour job by sending out a single application, while in this field, we can put in as much as 1000 times the effort (on paper) to land a position that is probably close to or a bit over double the pay. Or if, after all that, you land a really good job that's about 4 or 5 times the pay for that 1000 times more effort.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI feel like I'm in a very weird position compared to my peers. I can make a high salary, but I know that if I lose my job, I could be looking at being unemployed for 3-6 months or more if I put all my effort into looking for another CS job and don't get lucky. While it seems most of my peers can get by sending applications for a few weeks and land something. Honestly, when I think about it, that stability seems like the kind stability I expected this career path I expected to offer me. That having this skill set would mean I could have a job whenever I wanted.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nTo be clear, I wouldn't change my career path.

I also show him ahead of time what the document was like and he said \\\"yeah that format is fine\\\"\\n\\nThe meeting starts and my boss opens it and pretty aggressively interjects that this is basically worthless and not what he wanted and we're wasting our time by discussing it, ends the meeting and kicks everyone out and invites me into a different meeting. He tells me what he wants and I feel a bit taken aback by his asks: he wanted me to not only do the technical, but create jira boards, choose engineers to work on it, create a lot of documentation around it, set up timelines, set up recurring sync meetings, and do all this kind of stuff and said he was disappointed in me for not doing this\\n\\nI felt a bit confused because, to me, this sounded like it was more in the domain of a project manager. The project itself seemed like it was more suited for an SRE than a frontend engineer to begin with. I felt like I was being stretched pretty thin on things I am not terribly experienced with. This would normally be fine, if there was a clear expectation that it would take longer because i would have to learn these new skills, but the vibe I got was they expected me to already know how to do all these things intuitively\\n\\nThis wasn't the first time this happened. One time, someone on the team reached out to me and said they needed a design in figma, and asked me to do it. I was a bit confused by this, and I asked my manager and he said we don't have a designer and I would have to do it. I really only fiddled around with figma once before on another project. I figured out how to do everything I needed to do, but I felt as if this was adding an additional responsibility for little positive gain on my side\\n\\nOther times, I have been on call for systems I wasn't super familiar with as I had never really done anything on the backend. An alert came up, I fixed it, then they asked me to track down the bug. I found a log entry that pointed to the problem, roughly. They then instructed me to track it down in the backend code. I kinda tentatively agreed, then found where the error was emitted through a fairly simple search. Then... they told me to fix it. I have not written any java since college. I'd really have to acclimate to the codebase to know the \\\"correct\\\" solution for this. When I asked questions, they seemed actively annoyed with me like I should know this stuff already\\n\\nIs this normal? If it was a small company like a startup, I'd kinda get it.

I work on a fairly small team which has somewhat of a start-up culture, which is very different from my previous job at a larger publicly traded fintech company. (The only other tech job I've had) I'm also the only frontend dev on the team. It's been really apparent to me ever since I started that my boss is a dick. He's very condescending to everyone, he doesn't listen to other team members' opinions, and he's an extreme micro-manager. I tend to just brush it off but I had a one on one meeting with him this morning that left me feeling really pissed off.\\n\\nTo give some background, I live with my wife who is in her third trimester of pregnancy and so we've been having lots of doctor's appointments lately. This morning my boss had a discussion with me about my availability. He believes I'm not putting in a full 40 hours each week because I have to occasionally go out and tend to personal matters throughout the day, and he believes that my communication with the team isn't good when I do have to go out. If I have an appointment during the week I put it on my Teams calendar and I let the team know during morning scrum that I'll be OOO during such and such time. Apparently putting it on my Teams calendar is insufficient because it's not on my personal Outlook calendar, which is what others can view. I didn't know this until recently. (I'm used to using MacOS and Slack, not Windows and Teams) I don't exactly keep track of the number of hours I work each day, but regardless of if I have an appointment during the day or not, I almost always work well into the evening, sometimes until 10 at night. I will often work during weekends as well. The managers at my last job cared more about the actual work output instead of specific hours people are working so I'm not used to this.\\n\\nThe mistake about the Outlook calendar is not a big deal. That's easily fixed. But he is now making me log everything I do each day in an excel sheet that he can see so that he can ensure that I'm reaching a full 40 hours each week. He said something along the lines of \\\"I really don't have the time or energy to make sure each team member is completing their work. I need independence. And now I've had to spend time making this sheet for you. I haven't had to do this for anyone else.\\\"\\n\\nIs this normal behavior? I have no problem accepting the feedback that my communication with the team needs to be better, but the excel sheet feels really patronizing and this level of micro-managing is giving me lots of anxiety each day. I have pretty severe ADHD and I often feel overwhelmed trying to balance work, a pregnant wife, and also taking care of all of our cats and dogs.

I started part-time and quickly transitioned to a full-time role at a startup-like company (#2), where I rapidly advanced to a senior engineer position. This was thanks to gaining a broad experience in frontend, backend development, AWS, database management, and other dev tools (like Datadog, LogRocket and Cypress).\\n\\nHowever, post-acquisition of our company, my role underwent significant changes, ultimately leading to a transfer to the acquiring company's team. This transition has been challenging due to a toxic workplace culture, where long-term employees monopolize exciting projects, leaving newer ones like me with maintenance work. This environment lacks career growth opportunities, preferring external hires over internal promotions, and my current tasks\\u2014mainly simple React, Node.js, and SQL queries\\u2014offer little in the way of development or challenge (it takes me around 3-4 days to complete all of my tasks in a two-week sprint).\\n\\nIn response to these limitations and the lack of meaningful projects, I've taken the initiative to further my development skills. Over the past three months, I've delved into JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, advanced SQL, and several JS frameworks. I've also started a small project to apply these new skills (using Vike and Solidjs). My goal is to build my knowledge base from the ground up, ensuring a solid understanding of these technologies. I am open to learning other technologies and languages as well.\\n\\nWith the current market situation and my stagnant position, I'm reaching out for advice on how to navigate my career forward. Ideally, I'd like to continue learning and expanding my skill set during this period when I have a lot of free time, positioning myself for better job opportunities when the market improves and the timing is right.\\n\\nI'd greatly appreciate any insights or personal experiences you can share on advancing my career from this point.

But it isn't sustainable.\\n\\n**How can I relearn to turn off work mode once I'm off the clock? Requesting bulleted list-like recommendations.**\\n\\n--------\\n\\nSelf-taught programmer here. With zero relevant skills or experience, I set my sights on a career in machine learning engineering, then pursued it at all costs. In the end, I succeeded. But only after years of late nights, long weekends, and much personal and social sacrifice.\\n\\nProfessionally speaking, it was totally worth it: I love my job; it gives me meaning and purpose, and in a real sense it has become a core part of my identity. I also find ML and SWE immensely interesting, which is the main reason I've been able to stick with it despite the learning curve and firehose of new things to learn.\\n\\nBut at the same time, in retrospect, I fear I overdid it. The habitual diligence I established along the way has become problematic, unbalanced, and unhealthy. It causes work mode to majorly encroach on my personal life. For example:\\n\\n- Most of my colleagues clock out at 5, while I never feel like I'm at a good stopping point until dinner time, eating into family time.\\n\\n- Sometimes on weekends I'll disappear into my home office for 10-20 minutes at a time to check out pull requests and such, again taking away from family time.\\n\\n- Whenever I sit down to watch a movie with the partner, I'll compulsively open my computer and do work or miscellaneous FOSSing on GitHub with one half of my brain while watching TV with the other half.\\n\\n- I get so in the zone while working, detesting the need to context switch so much, that important life shit that must happen during M-F 9-5 doesn't get done (e.g., going to the bank; calling offices for personal reasons).\\n\\n- Whereas once I used to read the news, watch popular TV shows and such, I now spend all my time watching, reading, or thinking about code and things related to it. Now I'm totally out of touch. Code and work are almost the only things I know how to talk about now.\\n\\nIt's weird. I'd never been a workaholic a day in my life before gunning for MLE, not even close. If anything, I was lazy and complacent. But all that changed once I started teaching myself math and programming. Now I barely recognize myself.\\n\\nFunny thing is, I don't really even give a fuck about my specific job. The company is stupid, the mission is stupid, the projects are stupid. I just love to code and want to do a good job of it to progress my career and support my family. If it takes 10 hours of work per day to do that, so be it. But I am slowing realizing that it probably doesn't.\\n\\nI read comments from people in this sub being like \\\"I only work 10 hours a week\\\". I'm not saying I want that. Instead, I just want to work 40, ya know? Rather than being unable to work less than 50-60 every week for an unknown reason. It's like a lack of discipline, but in reverse: I literally *can't not* overwork. It's bizarre.\\n\\nSo yeah, for those of you normal people who are able to turn off work mode once the clock strikes 5, how do you do it? Or better yet: If there are any others like me - people with no background who had to sacrifice everything to enter the field - how have you managed to maintain a healthy work-life balance in a field which constantly changes and in which layoffs and instability are rife? Is there an actionable list of Life Pro Tips I can adopt which will help me stay more disciplined and keep my workaholism in check?\\n\\n--------\\n\\nEdit: Possibly relevant - I'm pretty sure I have ADHD.

I'll be starting the job in a few months and never told them about this change. Do you think this change will matter? The application has always just listed a \\\"Bachelorette\\\" as a requirement, so I'm confident that the BA is probably fine. I'm just not sure if they'll care that I had to drop the math minor.

Please go easy on me, I'm desperate.\\n\\nI'm a current sophomore at a school that's fairly prestigious (but not particularly known for CS) trying to decide between three companies, including one that I already accepted. I'm aiming for SWE at a FAANG-ish company for full time (mainly just interested in pay and work-life balance), but I also am pretty interested in AI/ML stuff.\\n\\nThe offer that I've accepted is a SWE position at a midwestern startup that's grown fairly large (a couple thousand employees). They gave me a one-day exploding offer a couple months ago so I accepted it, but now that I have other offers I'm thinking about reneging. This year is the first time they're doing SWE internships, but my mentor would be an ex-FAANG and I feel like I could learn a lot of good practices from him. It's only 30 hours per week and pay is 25/hour, though at least they provide housing for interns. The biggest positive for me is that it's SWE and I'll be working with a relevant SWE tech stack. \\n\\nThe second offer is an MLE position at a very small AI/ML research contractor (like 30-40 employees) that works primarily for the army and healthcare stuff. This is their second year having an intern program and their first year hiring undergrads (they only had grad students last year), but the project would be really cool. It's more on the SWE side so I could probably put the position as SWE on my resume, and it's a client project where I'd be taking drone footage and existing elevation data to create a 3D map of the area underneath the drone. The pay is 30/hr and 40 hours a week, though no housing. The biggest con for me is that I'd likely be working mostly with data science/ML tech stacks, even if I'll be doing SWE-y work.\\n\\nThe third offer is Data Science at Cisco, and I'd be working on detecting suspicious activity/security breaches through log data. I don't have a written offer yet so there's still potential they rugpull me, but assuming they don't my pay would be around 35/hr (no housing) and it should be 40 hours a week too. The biggest pro for this one would obviously be name recognition, and especially since I have another year to intern I might be able to get past more resume screens next year with an internship at Cisco. However, it's data science, and not close enough to SWE work to flub the position name like my MLE internship. In line with that, I'm concerned that I wouldn't be learning SWE skills. However, the enormous amounts of data that I'd be handling could be very valuable for learning.\\n\\nSorry for the long descriptions, I tried to give a lot of details since I know it's hard to give good advice if you don't have the full picture. I'm currently leaning towards reneging and going with the MLE position, but I know Cisco has more prestige than the others and might get me past more resume screens even if it's not a SWE position.

So I checked out LinkedIn and saw Epic Systems was hiring in my area. I thought, \\\"great, this role looks like I fit well for it and I can commute 30 minutes to it\\\". \\n\\nI get an email for an invite to a call with the recruiter. Once on the call I quickly realized I wasn't on a 1x1 with a recruiter but a group call where I could only interact via a Zoom Q&A. I thought, \\\"Sure, whatever. Maybe they get a big influx of candidates and don't wanna repeat themselves all day\\\". They spoke about a lot of pluses working for the company, but carefully left out small details. One pro was that every 5 years you get a whole month off (what they call a \\\"sabbatical\\\"). What's the tradeoff though? 10 days of PTO a year for your first two years and 15 thereafter. I currently get 23 days off a year, which is already a month long \\\"sabbatical\\\" I could be taking yearly (that being said, that is also my sick time, but that doesn't really cut that much into vacations anyway....I also don't know what their sick time policy is). They didn't answer my questions about salary range and 401k matching. \\n\\nThey then told me that I'd have to take a small technical literacy test described in [this video](https://youtu.be/J1tYvwk-rbM?si=p-SksdnD2Ct0TnlL). I figured OK I've taken coding assessments for Amazon, IBM, Google. This will probably be about an hour or less.\\n\\n....I was so wrong. It took me 2 hours. It was a 2 minute quick-maths test, 10-15 general math questions, 20 vague logic questions about a hypothetical language, and then **4** programming questions! The 4 questions were 2 leetcode easy and 2 leetcode mediums! They also asked me what my SAT and ACT scores were! What I need to reiterate though is....\\n\\n## I applied to a senior level role at this company \\n\\nI'm fine with doing coding questions, but the rest of that stuff was stuff you give to \\\"entry-level\\\" college graduate who've never had applicable experience. The real kicker is they asked me to do a \\\"Rembrandt Profile\\\" assessment (like a personality test) that they estimated would take me 20 minutes **after doing a 2 hour technical literacy assessment**. One of the questions asked me which of 4 foods had the most carbs in it. WTF?\\n\\nI'm just really weirded out by this company. If I was a fresh college grad, I think I wouldn't have known better and thought this is an amazing company (I will say their campus looks really nice and I heard the food is amazing), but as a seasoned person I get this really weird vibe from Epic. It kinda seems like a cult. The other weird part was that they said *all* of their 13,000 employees work out of Madison, WI and that if us candidates saw otherwise in job platforms, they were wrong about the location. It just seems weird that I can view an Epic job on LinkedIn claiming to be in my closest and second closest city, but they *swear* they don't post their jobs in other cities intentionally.\\n\\nI have yet to hear about next steps, but I'll post some edits if I hear back.

Per my clarinet instructor's advice, I started a master's in clarinet performance, but dropped out. After that, I got a job as a pharmacy technician through my sister and have been doing that for the past 2 years. After leaving school, I finally started socializing regularly with people, something I hadn't done since high school. All my bad choices with school have left me with a bunch of debt and no job opportunities. I've been applying to all sorts of jobs (CS, music, and pharmacy): and after 2 years I got a better pharm tech job, only to have my car break down and now I'm just working both jobs to pay for the car.\\n\\nNow that I explained where I've been and where I'm at, back to CS: I never built a (social) network in CS while at school, I understand now that is a big reason why I never found jobs or interships. I've given up hope multiple times. Only to again come back to CS in hopes of a better paying job. When I added the music degree, I said I hated CS. It was stressful and frustrating, and I was getting no where in it. During my first few semesters as a CS major, I often had the highest score on tests and assignments.

I started a Nonogram solver, but I realized this was all too similar, and, while it was probably good programming review, it is easy beginner stuff. \\n\\nI get paralyzed trying to pick something to study or make because I don't know if it will actually amount to anything. If I quit one of my jobs to try to get back into CS, it's only worth it, if I can actually get a job, otherwise I'll just be screwing myself over.

However, I wanted to add a few crucial things that readers might be interested about.\\n\\n# 1: Beware for European readers\\n\\nFirstly, **the doom and gloom on the CS market is very much US-centric**. The complaints you hear about the USA are very real, but the situation in Europe is much different.\\n\\nLooking at the job market here in Italy, it's definitely not as perfect as It was back in 2021-2022, but it's very hard to say it's as bad as this subreddit claims. You're not going to get a spectacular job at the beginning but you're going to get one. It will require a few months out of school and studying skills that university did not teach you, but remember this key difference between the EU and US market: here in the EU our pay ceiling doesn't get close to the US, but the silver lining is that the floor is higher and getting your foot in the door is much easier. There is still a severe lack of engineers of a reasonably good skill level. If you're actually desperate for a job and have a CS degree (yes - this is required now, the bootcamp / self taught ship has sailed long ago) you can always get into some local company who will literally hold an academy to teach you their tech and hire you. It's not amazing and it's generally recommend to shoot for big multinational companies, but you must take a step back: some experience is always better than no experience, and doing 1-2 years in a smaller company, get that in your CV and then jump ship is generally considered to be the way to go. We are relatively lucky in this respect since this is an option many USA applicants wish they had.\\n\\nIf you're in the EU, relax. Don't relax too much! You still need to put in the work, but it's not as bad.\\n\\n# 2. Web is saturated\\n\\nA lot of people I am seeing here are applying for web dev positions and are unsurprisingly not finding much success.\\n\\nThis has been happening for a while and it is not of much surprise to anybody who has kept tabs with the field. This is how it always works: you ideally want to position yourself in that niche where a technology is new enough that you don't have entire generations of workers behind you who already have expertise in it, but also mature enough that it's actually getting deployed. Web dev has been the sweet spot for a while but it has finally reached maturity.\\n\\n**The barrier for entry to web is very low**, low enough that self-taught and bootcamp grads also got in. It's very easy to get started with web: again, it has reached maturity. There is no shortage of high-quality roadmaps and learning resources online, which makes the path to becoming a web developer fairly reproducible. This is bad, because you're not going to be the only person to have the same idea.\\n\\n**It's time to start to look elsewhere**. There is more to life than web development, and there are several fields that are not saturated yet and actively hiring, like DevOps, Cloud engineer, Embedded engineer, et cetera. The caveat is that getting there is not a linearly reproducible process, the learning resources are not going to be abundant, and it will require a lot of unconventional self-studying. But it's still doable.\\n\\n# 3. There is more to life than CS - start seeing STEM as a general field, and CS as an angle to it.\\n\\nWhen you choose to study computer science in college you are not joining a bootcamp, you are joining an university. What you get is an angle from which to study science. In fact, CS degrees tend to have a lot of optional exams from other areas of STEM.\\n\\nPeople see all those STEM degrees as tidy little boxes that don't inter-operate at all, but that's a lie. Talk to some engineers, mathematicians and biotechnologists for a bit and you'll see how large the overlap actually is. It's still possible to become an \\\"hybrid\\\" figure that knows not only CS, but also something from some other field. In the US you even get dual-degree options for that. In Europe, you can optional exams from foreign credit groups that you can plan out to meet the criteria to move into a Master's Degree from Engineering or something else.\\n\\nIf you happen to love science and mathematics in general and only so happen to be in CS because you valued that angle, there is a lot out there that is not strictly and only CS for you to consider.\\n\\nThanks for reading, hopefully I have provided some non-toxic positivity and improved the vibe a little.\"", "title": "A measured take on the job market situation", "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1bdol96/a_measured_take_on_the_job_market_situation/"}, {"author": "CommercialBig7008", "created_utc": 1710273174.0, "num_comments": 8, "post_id": "1bd6qf7", "score": 3, "subreddit": null, "text": "\"Every time a company sends an initial 2 hour HackerRank assessment to do before getting to the interview stage, I get fucking obliterated by the questions.

For example, my process is something like:\\n\\n* Each person on the team is usually the sole developer on some part of the code, so we pretty much decide what to do on our own and use scrum/stand-up to announce what we're working on (no one cares)\\n* We pick a coworker to do our merge reviews for us, sometimes we are too busy and MRs are basically just a formality\\n* Unit tests are encouraged but not required so code coverage is at about 20%\\n* Code conventions are non-existent\\n* Our \\\"manager\\\" is also the CTO and has a million better things to do than check up on what we are doing\\n\\nI feel like I'm missing out on a lot of what it means to be a professional software engineer and I'm just really curious how y'all's process looks so I can prepare myself.

We connected over this, I handed them my resume, and then they pointed me to also apply online and mention that I spoke with them. I did this the following morning.The next day I was ask to send my schedule for an short interview to get to know one another. We had this interview, it went great, and then the quickly scheduled me to have a technical interview with them tomorrow afternoon.\\n\\n  \\nThe interview has no coding so I am not worried about leetcoding for an overworked senior engineer or anything. It is primarily a discussion on my projects, previous work experience, and the depth of my knowledge for each.This company is known to hire CS students from my university while they are in their last year, which is where I am. In fact, a huge number of employees matriculate from my school to their business. It is a pretty exciting prospect!\\n\\n  \\nMy question(s) is this:While I know I have not been offered the job and I am still interviewing, I am operating under the notion that I will get it. Both for my confidence and practice with interviewing. I do really wish to work for them. Their product is awesome, they are engineering focused, and use all sorts of new technology with a HEAVY focus on learning and ensuring new engineers thrive.If I am offered the job, how do I navigate the accepted internship offer and this position? I realize it may take me a bit to onboard. Ideally, and yes I am asking to have my cake and eat it too, I could do my 8 week internship this summer and then start with them full-time following that. It would be a great learning experience for my working on large enterprise software prior, so I thought.\\n\\n  \\nHowever, I do realize they are a company too, investing in a junior, and may not wish to wait that long.

So far the interview process is going great and I am operating under the notion I will get the position (I always have the internship to fall back on). I want to have my cake and eat it too. How could I theoretically negotiate, if at all, to do the short summer internship and then start with the full-time company following the end of my internship?

So, I started writing some fixes and submitting PRs then immediately got called into a meeting with my manager. He was mad that I wasn't \\\"planning\\\" more.

I started categorizing them, but he started a meeting and showed me how *he* would categorize them.

I was confused -- how would it ever be fixed unless someone submits the code to fix them? Am I not supposed to write code? If not, what am I supposed to be doing? He seemed to act like it should be obvious and would frequently echo \\\"you're not acting like an L5\\\".\\n\\nHe assigned some people to help out but frankly I found this to be more of an impedance than help. I was surprised how little domain knowledge some of the team had on frontend. Many struggled with a11y suggestions that were as easy as \\\"change this h1 to an h2\\\" and needed me to explicitly guide them through it. For me, reading the excel row made it incredibly obvious this was the ask. I checked the commit history and very little had been changed in this codebase for \\\\~4 years, it was on react 15 and webpack 4.\\n\\nThere were a small handful that were more difficult fixes. Certainly not anything I didn't know how to do, but they required more than just swapping out a component or adding a prop. When I made recommendations on how to fix them, I received a lot of backlash. For example, we had a code editor that was just a texbox. I pointed out we have internal docs from the UI team on a code editor component and how it should be used. They didn't like this and told me not to do that. I didn't know what they *wanted* me to do if not that.

He was just mad about how I approached it. He then went on to tell me that I'm on thin ice, I think his exact words were \\\"you don't even know how precarious of a situation you're in right now\\\"\\n\\nAs time went on, every 1:1 it seemed like was covering how badly I was doing, no matter what the thing was. I honestly got to the point where I figured I couldn't do *anything* right so stopped trying. Some of the team would ask me my opinion on something as the \\\"subject matter expert on ui\\\".

From that point on, I started working on a series of personal projects to aid my own learning. Fast forward to the summer of 2023, I got accepted to a master's program for people transitioning to CS from other professional backgrounds and started that fall. I have kept up with a variety of projects, gradually moving on from Python to Javascript and C with an elevated focus on embedded systems. I'm slated to finish this program in Spring 2026.\\n\\nWhile I definitely have a ways to go as a student and a professional, I've started applying to internships to little avail. I know the market is terrible and definitely not overly open to applicants with little experience, but I've struggled in getting answers from anyone about what to expect or what my strategy should be in seeking an internship. I met with someone earlier this week who offers mentorship services and he seemed wholly uninterested during our meeting in a way that made me feel like I was asking the wrong questions. As someone who wants to get some amount of working / co-op experience prior to graduating despite having no prior professional software experience, here are my questions:  \\n\\n\\n1. Am I being too ambitious by applying to internships before completing my first year as a master's student? Should I have started sooner, or waited until I was further along in my studies? Based on the structure of job applications I've seen so far, there have been no indications that the hiring managers were actually checking what I've learned outside of the documentation I have for my projects, so I have a hard time believing that waiting another year will make me any more qualified.\\n2. What is the best way for me to spend my time so that I become a more competitive applicant for the next cycle of summer internships, in the absence of professional experience? I've been getting closer to professors and have started getting more involved in a niche (embedded systems), but something tells me that unless those professors have a direct connection to a hiring company, that it might just be a waste of time. \\n3. How should I be maintaining my personal projects in a way that's more hirable to employers? I've been steadily maintaining new projects for over a year now, but haven't been revisiting old projects as they are more or less complete as far as I can tell. I've extensively documented all of these projects but haven't really touched many of them in a few months other than my active projects. I'm not sure what the policy is for linking personal pages otherwise I'd plug my GitHub here. These projects aren't mind blowing but also aren't just generic experience fodder, so I would hope that my application would reflect this work.\\n4. How should I be framing my past work experience in light of this career transition?  When I was an undergraduate, I worked a variety of odd jobs as well as a few research positions. In many of these jobs I used skills that might be relevant to a job in CS (designed a 3D printable hand tool for one job, wrote a script to streamline inventory processes in another, etc.) but ultimately have nothing to do with software on paper. \\n5. How optimistic should I really be applying for internships at this point in the game? I've heard that student internships are harder to come by than actual jobs right now, and many of the people in my position started applying in the fall. If I were to start again in the fall, however, I feel like I would be no more qualified then than I am now and the difference in timing might be an inconsequential difference if I'm not changing anything else about my approach. I really don't want to waste my time as a student by graduating with no experience.\\n\\nI'm not looking for a full-time job. Hell, I'm not even looking for money. It just feels like I'm shooting in the dark right now and I want to refine my approach. Again, I'm not even sure if I'm asking the right questions.   \\n\"", "title": "Finding an internship as a master's student with no prior experience", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1bcewbs/finding_an_internship_as_a_masters_student_with/"}, {"author": "CSCQMods", "created_utc": 1710226928.0, "num_comments": 4, "post_id": "1bcqzha", "score": 2, "subreddit": null, "text": "\"Please use this thread to chat, have casual discussions, and ask casual questions.

I'm in a situation right now where I heavily do not agree with a coworker's code even though it works and fits designs. We have a senior UI/UX designer who designs everything and gives it to us to code. It is a complex UI that involves selecting a component. Basically in order to get the functionality to work, there's about 10-15 if else statements based on how the user is interacting with the UI as well as multiple booleans inside each if/else statement.\\n\\nI suggested we change the designs (slightly, but still functional in terms of UI/UX), so that way our codebase is cleaner (my proposed simple solution would be 4 if else statements maximum with only 1 boolean per if statement). My coworker, who is my senior, is very against it. I personally think it is incredibly unsustainable to have 10-15 if else statements with multiple booleans in each one in case something were to break and/or we need to add more features in there (hopefully we do not).\\n\\nI have brought this up to my manager (not in a hostile way, but concerned), but the way it goes here is: if it works, let's go with it.

I have 4 years of experience working as a Data Scientist. In Q1 of last year, the startup I was working for unfortunately went out of business, and everyone was laid off.\\n\\nWhen that happened, I had some pretty pressing personal issues to address which I had been putting off for some time, and being unemployed suddenly made addressing them much easier. Because of that, I decided to not jump back into the workforce straight away, and resolve my issues first. I luckily had my family's full support here. Long story short, it is now almost exactly a year later, I have basically been able to resolve those issues, and I'm ready to hop back into the workforce. Luckily, I also was able to travel a fair bit during this past year as well, so my narrative to explain this period of unemployment on my resume is that I took a sabbatical to fulfill a long-held dream of traveling through various different countries (as well as work on some mostly non-data related side projects).\\n\\nNow I'm applying for jobs again, and I'm getting a small amount of traction but things are moving slowly. On the flip side, the startup I worked for that went out of business was able to come back from the dead (4 man team now), get funding and offer me a job again. I'm not super excited to go back and work for them for many reasons. The work they want me to do isn't my favorite. I would also prefer to work at a later-stage, more established company where losing my job overnight isn't a risk. The company going out of business and a couple of other things shook my faith in the CEO, his competence and vision. And I would just like to have an experience at a different company. The compensation package is good, but the CEO wants me to commit to the long-haul with them, which I'm not super inclined to do.\\n\\nSo there lies the question: **should I risk declining my ex-bosses job offer and continue looking for a new job while extending my unemployment beyond a year, or should I play it safe and accept his offer, while possibly being unhappy and unsatisfied with the job?**\\n\\nI know that overall this is not a good situation to be in, but if I hadn't absolutely needed to take this break for my mental and physical health, I wouldn't have.\\n\\nThe one piece of good news is that I'm fortunate enough to not be in a hurry from a financial perspective. My parents are aware of the problems I was dealing with and I have supported myself with a combination of my savings and my parents' support so far. They are able to continue supporting me, but I obviously want to go back to being financially independent as soon as I can.\\n\\nLet me know what you think.

I'm making fairly decent money for a Canadian SWE (you Americans should consider yourselves lucky cuz your salaries are 50%% higher by default) and am hopeful I can aim even higher once the job market recover. Here are the three things I did that helped:\\n\\n1. I followed u/erectionwhisperer advice in the original thread and got tested for ADHD, turns out I have it. I got prescription medication from my family doctor for it. After taking my pills I found the difference in my work efficiency to be night and day compare to before. Before medication my brain was functioning at most 1/3 efficiency at work, the medication finally allowed me to function at same level as a normal human being. Within 1.5  year of me making that post the same people who used to call me a shitty dev said I'm \\\"finally useful\\\". I went from a dev who contantly got yelled at for being unable to do basic things to teaching other people how to do those things.\\n\\n2. You do have to study outside of work: unfortunately this is just true with our career: I found what helped me was reading some of the more common programming textbooks (Clean code handbook, Clean Architecture, the pragmatic programmer are my recommends). They helped me realize why my code were always buggy messes which are impossible to debug despite me knowing the language I was writing in fairly well. It turned out my problem was not because I didn't know how ConcurrentHashMap work in Java or whatever, it was because I didn't know how to design/modularize my code properly.\\n\\n3. Social skills matter: I didn't get my current job from beating leetcode interviews, I got it because my co-workers at my old workplace liked me. We share a lot of the same interests/hobbies and on slower days would spent afternoons just chatting. When I got laid off from my old job a few years ago I interviewed at over 30 places and failed all but one (I refused that offer because it was bad). Then my old boss founded a new company and invited me onboard, I don't think he would have done that if they didn't like me because frankly my job performance was poor even for a junior at my old position. I think if I didn't have that lifeline I might have given up on being a SWE and moved into a supporting role.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo there you have it, the thing I regret the most is not getting diagnosed 10 years earlier than I did. I had the pedigree and opportunity to get into a FAANG easily around time I graduated that I missed out on because of my undiagnosed ADHD. When I look at my old classmates half of them are in director level positions now.

I was interviewing for a full stack role at a popular online therapy company, I won't say the name but its easy to guess as they've been sponsoring a bunch of YouTube creators.\\n\\nI went through a total of 5 interviews before being told by the recruiter that I am not a fit for this role which is hitting me hard a couple days later. I am writing this out really just to vent as well as let other applicants know what happens in these interviews.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the interviews:\\n\\n1. The first interview was a 30 minute call with the recruiter who had reached out to me on LinkedIn. I didn't apply, she came looking for me. She told me she was looking for a full stack developer who leaned towards frontend as they were looking for someone with React & React Native experience as well as backend experience with PHP, Laravel & Symfony components. Given this information, I thought I would be a perfect fit so I went ahead with interview process.\\n2. The second interview was a 90 minute TestDome quiz which had 4-5 questions covering PHP, Javascript & SQL. Scored 100% on PHP & JavaScript and 88% on SQL. Nothing significant to note, just a straightforward test.\\n3. The third interview was a 45 minute conversation with one of their software engineering managers, in my opinion the conversation went really well as he really just wanted to understand my past experiences and problem solving skills as a developer. He too was a self taught software engineer so there was a lot of synergy between the both of us.\\n4. The fourth interview was the hardest as it was a 5 hour virtual onsite. Per the requirement document I was tasked with building a survey form with two types of questions radio (single answer) and checkboxes (multiple choice). I was required to seed the database with 6 questions that were a mix of radio / checkbox questions. I also needed to make it possible to add, edit, remove and reorder the existing questions. Lastly, I was also tasked with building a page for displaying the form results to investigate user happiness (for context one of the predefined questions was asking if they are happy). Given I had 4 hours of dev time, the requirements said it was okay to \\\"cut corners\\\" as long as it wasn't in the database schema setup. Personally, I felt 4 hours wasn't enough dev time for this as I was feeling rushed for most of the interview. At the end of my dev time I was then tasked with demoing the project & the code itself to the 5 developers on the panel who then asked questions about my code decisions. I made the frontend look good and made the user experience easy as I used Laravel + Inertia React. Admittedly though my raw SQL skills weren't the best as I've typically relied on ORM's in the past.  However they made it a point to test my SQL abilities which I felt was a bit weird as I was under the impression this was a full stack role that leaned more towards frontend than backend so I spent more time focusing on the frontend than the backend. However as a last ditch effort to try to prove my raw SQL abilities I pulled up the database from a personal project that I work on the side. The project gets a couple thousand site visitors so I showed them how I use raw SQL to generate email reports about the project's insights. Admittedly this was very impromptu and I felt I didn't present it in the best light. I for sure thought I wouldn't be passed along to the next stage of the interview.\\n5. Surprisingly, I got an email back from the recruiter who told me that despite my SQL skills not being the sharpest, the developer panel was more impressed by the work on my personal project as they said it showed initiative & ambition which is what they were looking for in this role.  They also felt I had the ability to get better at raw SQL if I was actually on the job as many of the developers in their org are also self taught. Given that, she told me the fifth & final interview was about testing to see how well I understood their product and testing my ability to put on a project manager hat as a developer. They gave me a free trial for their product and I was tasked with finding 1-2 things I would improve on their product. The interview was 90 minutes long and required me to present my arguments in a Google Slide Deck. I basically pointed out that they could improve their onboarding flow by making their desktop design match their mobile design as well as improving one other small product feature. In this interview I presented to a total of 4 people, 2 were developers from the previous panel, one product designer and one clinical therapist as I mentioned they are a therapy app. I thought the interview went well but was emailed 24 hours later by the recruiter \\\"*The team was able to put their heads together to debrief in more depth after your final interview yesterday. Unfortunately, at this time, the team has decided not to move forward. I know this isn't the news we were hoping for and I'm sorry to have to share it with you*.\\\"\\n\\nI am upset that it took the company a total of 5 interviews (a total of 10 hours) for them to realize I wasn't a good fit especially after being led on by the other 4 interviews. This doesn't sting as much as it should though as I've had a very similar experience with Shopify where I went through 4 of their interviews and was rejected on the last one as well. With Shopify at least the recruiter had the decency to give me a phone call and give me feedback on the areas I could improve on. However with this company the recruiter just gave me a canned email response and didn't care to give me any feedback at all. Yes, I understand they don't HAVE to give feedback to their candidates but the fact that you took up 10 hours of my time after reaching out to me and don't have the decency to tell me what went wrong is absurd.

Some info: I want to do an MS while I work and have my company pay and most of these part-time programs take ~3 yrs to complete, give or take. Now my job/pay is alright, but the city I live in is not amazing for me, as it\\u2019s not oriented for tech or young ppl at all. It\\u2019s more of a place to settle down. I\\u2019m not even 25 yet, so I really want to move to the Bay Area for:\\n1. Living in a bigger/more exciting city with younger folks\\n2. Networking and startup opportunities with other tech folks\\n3. Attending tech events and meeting other likeminded individuals \\n\\nMy dilemma is that I can either: \\nOption 1. Stay at my job/city and do the MS while I work and do this for the next 3+ yrs.\\nOR\\nOption 2. Stay at my job/city but apply for the next 6 months-year to try and get a job in the Bay. If I do this option, I can defer my admission up to a year with the MS programs.\\n\\nJust as a heads up, I\\u2019ve already applied to maybe 100 jobs in the last 6 months (which I know isn\\u2019t that many), but the response rate hasn\\u2019t been great probably due to the bad job market.\\n- Also, I\\u2019m well aware the Bay Area is very expensive to live in. This is something that I\\u2019m okay with and is not a factor for me.\\n- Another thing is that if I switch to a company in the Bay that doesn\\u2019t offer me tuition assistance like my current company, I\\u2019m okay for paying for the MS on my own as some of the programs are very cheap (like the GT OMSCS). This is also not much of a factor for me.\\n\\nOption 1:\\n- Pros: I can continue progressing with my career and not waste any time.\\n- Cons: I have to live in a relatively boring city where I\\u2019m not 100% happy and there isn\\u2019t room for growth outside of my job.\\n\\nOption 2:\\n- Pros: I\\u2019ll be taking action to live where I want to live and I think it\\u2019ll help my morale a lot if I\\u2019m able to land a job in the Bay.\\n- Cons: If the job market is really as bad as it seems and I\\u2019m unable to land a job after a year, then I feel like I\\u2019ll have wasted a year applying to jobs when I could\\u2019ve been a year into my MS learning. \\n\\nAnyway, sorry for the long post. I tried to include all the details I could. I\\u2019m very grateful to be in this position as I know plenty of ppl are still looking for jobs.

Strap in, because I'm about to drop some truth bombs that might just shatter your illusions about this so-called \\\"dream career.\\\"\\n\\nFirst off, let's talk about LeetCode. If you haven't spent countless sleepless nights grinding away at those algorithmic problems, then you might as well kiss your chances of landing a decent gig goodbye. Companies these days don't care about your GPA or where you went to school; they want to see that you can solve a dynamic programming question in your sleep.\\n\\nAnd let's not even get started on total compensation. Gone are the days when a cushy salary was enough to keep us satisfied. Now it's all about that sweet, sweet stock RSU. If you're not pulling in six figures worth of vested shares from a FAANG company, then you might as well be flipping burgers for a living.\\n\\nOh, and don't even think about job hopping. Sure, it might seem tempting to chase after that higher salary, but trust me, recruiters can smell a serial hopper from a mile away. Stick it out at one company for a few years, build up that resume, and then maybe you'll have a shot at landing your dream job.\\n\\nAnd let's not forget about artificial intelligence and machine learning. If you're not constantly keeping up with the latest advancements in AI, then you might as well be coding in COBOL. This industry moves at the speed of light, and if you can't keep up, then you'll quickly find yourself obsolete.\\n\\nSo there you have it, folks. The cold, hard truth about a career in software development. It's not all fun and games; it's a brutal, unforgiving battlefield where only the strong survive. But hey, if you think you've got what it takes to make it in this dog-eat-dog world, then by all means, give it your best shot.

However, there's a lot of uncertainty - maybe the big winners will be completely different to those you predict (and may not even exist yet).\\n* Focus on slightly more AI resistant skills e.g. managerial skills/customer relations may be more useful than learning extra programming languages/tech stacks.

I\\u2019m not even 25 yet, so I really want to move to the Bay Area for:\\n1. Living in a bigger/more exciting city with younger folks\\n2. Networking and startup opportunities with other tech folks\\n3. Attending tech events and meeting other likeminded individuals \\n\\nMy dilemma is that I can either: \\nOption 1. Stay at my job/city and do the MS while I work and do this for the next 3+ yrs.\\nOR\\nOption 2. Stay at my job/city but apply for the next 6 months-year to try and get a job in the Bay. If I do this option, I can defer my admission up to a year with the MS programs.\\n\\nJust as a heads up, I\\u2019ve already applied to maybe 80-90 jobs in the last 6 months (which I know isn\\u2019t that many), but the response rate hasn\\u2019t been great probably due to the bad job market.\\n- Also, I\\u2019m well aware the Bay Area is very expensive to live in.

I have no problem learning new things but the pace at which the tech industry expects is not sustainable.\\u201d  \\n  \\nThis is something that resonate in me. So I wanted to have your opinion on this.  \\nI am fresh graduate and I never have worked so I was curious how it is for people working. How do you keep fresh, up to date and employable. If you work 9h a day, transport and other obligations\\u2026 then  you don\\u2019t have time for side project or side learning, do you ? especially with extremely fast evolving industry.\\n\\nI am all for hard working and getting rewarded for it, hassle culture etc... Here is how I see it, in standard jobs employees work their day and they come home to start their live (family lives, friends, children anything\\u2026). But in IT i feel it very different, we spent like h24/7 on it. When we go out from our job, well it is just the beginning. We listening the tech news, learn constantly, read a lot etc\\u2026 At work we are in production mode, but once we finish work we have to continue learning to stay up to date. Same for the weekends! Otherwise we get late, disconnected, loose value and become outdated, worthless on the market or ready to work on specific old tech only\\u2026 I don\\u2019t want this, I fear it and I suppose it is the same for most of us. When work in production mode at job, it feels like these 9h will be used by others to continue working and learning on cutting edge tech while I don\\u2019t progress, I produce on old/standard tech. Allowing others to double cross me.\\n\\nIn countries like USA, they get extremely well compensated with high salaries, so it\\u2019s ok having less of personal life.  But in Europe and especially far-leftist collapsing countries like France or Belgium, we just get standard income. So basically, just enough to survive. Can\\u2019t even plan to buy a home one day and we probably never get a decent pension either. So we work more, we work hard, we study more, we have to constantly re-learn, sacrifice of free time (including weekend) to learn whereas the average person with classic job just do it\\u2019s 5 days of 8h and just enjoy life. I have no issue with the job if it\\u2019s well compensated. But having the same pay then the average person that just do it\\u2019s hours in any bullshit jobs and enjoy life the rest of the time feel like a scam.So yeah the income could be a issue here but that\\u2019s another subject.\\n\\nAlso in this equalitarian, socialist countries we have to work till 68 or more to HOPEFULLY get a bit of pension fund. Pension fund we will most likely never get or that won\\u2019t cover much of what\\u2019s required to live even in poverty. But once again that\\u2019s another subject. The point here is the age. I am fresh and young and grew in this. But is it sustainable ? Constantly working and learning, even during weekend or free time for just the same as everyone. And that until 68 yo or more ? Looks toxic and unsustainable to me.

I have my BSc and I am working on my MSc via online education. I also have some certifications and side projects on all kinds of things. Most of what I've done professionally is infra, internal tools and test automation, but I've been trying to get into product development for a while now.\\n\\nI've been working for a big company full of super smart engineers and interesting projects  for the last 2 years, and it was great until last year. I was assigned to be the only engineer working full time in the Release team of a mid-sized project. So I've been working mostly alone, with not very interesting technologies compared to the rest of the project (containers, jenkins and gitlab pipelines and some scripting in bash and python). I also work 100% remotely, which was initially a good thing, but since right now I have no team I'm living the groundhog day over and over working alone on the same boring stuff everyday for a long time, and feeling I'm falling a bit behind as a SWE. I was told I would probably promote to senior this year if I did a good job on this team though.\\n\\nA months ago or so I got contacted by a recruiter for a Senior Backend position in a small startup. Although I haven't done any backend work professionally, I went through the interview process, did well and seemed like I was a good fit, and got an offer that is higher than my current salary. This company is quite small (less than 200 people) , full of young people, and the work is hybrid (3 days in the office with some flexibility). I also would have far fewer benefits and perks than what I have right now. On the other hand, I would do real product development work in a modern cloud web application in the health tech domain. All their backend is currently written in PHP (Laravel), but they are allegedly planning to migrate to Go, Rust, or a similar language (but who knows?). I would also learn DDD, CQRS, hexagonal architecture, and other architectural patterns which is a big plus for me since I really enjoy domain modelling. My feeling is that the company is pretty chill. They told me they don't do overtime, and everyone I met during the interview process seemed super nice and helpful. I'm a bit scared to take this offer for several reasons: changing from mid-level to senior, changing from doing infra to backend, going from remote back to the office, going from a big company to a small startup... And since I come from a big company they also have big expectations for me (I think), and although I am pretty hard-working and focused and think I will deliver, it's still a lot of pressure. Also, my wife recently stopped working, so we have a lot of expenses and just one income, and although we are doing well, stability is really important for me since I don't want to ruin what she's doing now.\\n\\nIn parallel, I also applied internally for a QA position in one of the cutting edge AI teams of my company. They mostly do cloud AI infra, so it's not like they're building LLMs or anything like that, but super interesting stuff still. I'm not sure which technologies I would use, since each team uses a different thing for their automated testing: some teams use Go, others Robot framework, others Cypress... I told them about the offer I got from the startup and they matched it, so the salary would also be better than what I have now. I can see a path forward where I get really involved in the project, do a good job, and attempt to switch from QA to Dev in 1-2 years, and end up doing development in a really cool AI project. The projects are mostly open-source so I would be free to start contributing to them whenever I like.  However I'm scared I get locked into the QA silo for life. QA is pretty technical in my company though, basically 0 manual testing and everyone is really skilled and technical, but I still would prefer to do development.\\n\\nFinally, my current manager was sad to hear that I was probably going to accept one of these offers, and offered to move me to a development team (AFAIK without salary increase). This team is full of highly skilled, very senior people, and they work on open-source projects most of the time, mostly using Go. But at the same time, the engineers working there are really busy and I know they won't \\\"hold my hand\\\" or mentor me in barely any way. Also, the domain is not very interesting for me, and certainly not as cutting edge as the AI project, so I would be there mostly for the tech they use and the nice work experience.\\n\\nI have to make the final call in a couple of days. For now, I'm mostly leaning towards taking the QA position in the AI team and ride the AI wave for a bit, working hard and trying to make the change from QA to development in 1 or 2 years, after I finish my MSc. But, as I said, I'm scared I get stuck in QA for the rest of my life (not necessarily a bad thing, I just enjoy writing software more than testing it). This position involves a nice salary bump, keeping all the perks I already have, and less risk than moving to a startup.\\n\\nWhat would you do in my shoes?

It feels like every tiny little thing that i want to get done needs to go through multiple meetings, tickets and managers in order to have any chance of moving forward.\\n\\nThis is incredibly frustrating when just trying to get things done in time for deadlines. In my previous company, Jira was nonexistent. Our PM would discuss things that need to get done with me and the CTO, and we'd then attack those ourselves and delegate as needed. Progress was tracked via draft PRs and that's it. It worked beautifully.\\n\\nHowever, now, every tiny little button change is discussed in grooming sessions organized by a scrum master, estimated via planning poker, talked about for 20m+ at a time and jiratized.

And many times when i review their code or discuss a change with them, they flat out refuse to act on our discussion, unless the fix to the bug fix is discussed in the next meeting (again at length of course), a ticket opened, that ticket added to the next sprint... etc. It's absolutely painful and slows down development to such a glacial pace i can barely stand it.\\n\\nI'm tempted to just do those stupid little bug fixes or stupid little features myself because it would take all of 15 minutes to just have it done. But of course, this would kinda defeat the purpose of having FE/BE devs in the first place. That being said i am still doing this to some degree as i am largely excluded from the Jira madness as far as it regards my own work and can just do whatever i feel needs to be done.\\n\\nOf course, the problematic devs in question do not tend to be the highest caliber in terms of their output either.

Are there many long-time engineers who are also experiencing the same?\\n\\n\\\\- I'm seeking advice, and exposing my problem points as well as my skills.\\n\\n\\\\- inb4 the \\\"6 yRs OfpRoGraMmiNg aNd You sTiLl dont KnoW this? rEd FlAg\\\" comments, I know I'm not perfect, but I'm always willing to work on my flaws, especially when related to my career, as I know so many of us are, so please be nice.\\n\\n\\\\- I'm mostly venting and hoping that some people have been in similar situations and will tell me it's going to be okay, but I'm also seeking advice. specific questions and tldr; to follow.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo, the issue:\\n\\nLike I said, I've been a developer for 6 years now, and full disclosure, my resume doesn't look too good because of my last two jobs. The former I had to quit after one month because my wife had to relocate. I was doing very well in that job and was actually headed toward a promotion. The latter I was fired after 3 months, due to a combination of ADHD and drug shortage, depression, and the adjustment to working from home while having responsibilities of a stay-at-home husband. Since we were both working, and since I worked from home, I had to step it up a bit in terms of chores. Note: I am in no way complaining because my wife does a lot for us both at home and work, and it just took a bit of time for me to get used to some extra responsibilities, namely time management. Too bad it took me till I had to get fired to learn to better manage my time.\\n\\nAnyway, I've been unemployed for about 6 months now, and I'm a little worried. In that time I've been working on my skills in my specialty (Android development), as well as studying hard for interviews, both in Android and data structures/software design/operating systems, etc. I  by no means been slacking, and have been doing whatever I can to scrounge up whatever income I could get, little as it may be. This was either through tutoring, or Uber, and whatever spare time I had I spent on just studying for interviews and applying like mad.\\n\\nSo, my questions are:\\n\\n\\\\- How can I salvage my resume? I've been unemployed for 6 months, and unfortunately I don't have many side projects other than tutoring that I can put on. I can at the very least start some github projects and put those on my resume.\\n\\n\\\\- Is there any kind of spin I can put to make the layoffs seem less offputting? Do I even put my 1-month and 3-month jobs on there? If I don't, then there's 12 months of unemployment on my resume. (My job before then was two years as a Software engineer at a large retail company, and they had laid off all contractors right around the time I was lead to believe I would be hired as a full-time SWE. oh well.)\\n\\n\\\\- I recognize that I may not have the best skill set, but like I said, I'm working on improving. What other fields should I look into in the realm of SWE and tech in general?  I have a very novice-level proficiency or interest at the following: backend dev w/docker/NodeJs/angular; webdev, but not yet learned react; working with training models, namely dialogflow and tensorflow; and a bit of network security (I have a security+ cert from 6 years ago).\\n\\n\\\\- Which of the above should I put all my energy into just to kind of expand my horizons? I still consider myself very up-to-date with Android native development, and will dedicate some time to keep up with that if necessary.\\n\\n\\\\- Is there any hope for me? For any of us? It seems that many of the posts I read here are about Junior devs struggling to get hired, so it's nice when I see a win or two. I'm here to tell you that once you land your first job after countless months of grinding, it gets easier. But now that I'm in a similar boat, I hope I can look back at this period in my life and once again confidently say it gets easier. but in the mean time, can any one else attest to this? Or should I just consider the market as over-saturated and apply to med school or something?\\n\\n\\\\- Also, I want to stress: which skills, and areas of expertise should I focus on now? AI/machine learning, web dev, or network security? Or should I learn cross-platform tools like flutter or ReactNative?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAny advice, words of wisdom, support, and general banter or ridicule appreciated.\\n\\nTLDR; I'm unemployed for 6 months, and though I have 6 years of SWE experience, I still have a LONG way to go and am seeking advice and support, but appreciate all responses.

I've never gotten to the follow-up interview stage on any of them. This is mostly my fault.\\n\\nThe most obvious way that it is my fault: A lot of projects get either abandoned before I even begin, or I just can't bring myself to do it for days until either I have to cram on the last day (at which point it will suck) or it's just too late period. Motivation is a big part of this, especially with the devops-adjacent stuff. Just setting up the dependencies and installations and upgrades and database migrations and the maze of folders that people expect anymore for organized code is a substantial chunk of time even if it all goes well (which it rarely does). And unfortunately all this has to be done first, I can't just start coding and ride the momentum from that, so by the time I'm done setting things up I'm already too demoralized to be at anything but rock bottom morale and confidence. (Recent example: I wasted like 3-5 hours on a take-home recently trying to teach myself Next.js for the client because they wanted React but you apparently can't use create-react-app anymore; I ultimately gave up, threw out all my progress and used something else. 3-5 wasted hours, which already was more time than the assignment told me to take. I know learning Next.js is a useful thing to do in general, but this doesn't seem like the right setting for it.)\\n\\nThen comes the project itself, and I never know how much polish they expect. Even take-homes that are very thorough about the high-level concepts they expect (code quality, scalability, etc.) tend to say nothing about the practicalities: how good I should make the UI/CSS, whether I need to implement features not explicitly stated for bonus points or whether that will knock off points for overengineering/not following rules, whether they actually mean it when they say \\\"do as much as you can in the X hours/days\\\" or if they expect it all to be done no matter what, *how to organize the code*, how much testing is expected, whether they expect me to use external libraries or roll my own stuff, what parts of the assignment are supposed to be handwaved or faked. I understand that the point is to gauge my good judgment on these, but my judgment apparently is bad to the degree that I'm never even invited to explain it.\\n\\nThanks for any advice you might have.\"", "title": "How can I get better/faster at take-home assignments?", "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1bact29/how_can_i_get_betterfaster_at_takehome_assignments/"}, {"author": "CSCQMods", "created_utc": 1709971328.0, "num_comments": 8, "post_id": "1bacncl", "score": 1, "subreddit": null, "text": "\"Please use this thread to chat, have casual discussions, and ask casual questions.

Designers, writers, developers, researchers, etc.\\n\\nI've stated in so many ways how the AI isn't there yet to be able to completely do things the way we do. Not to mention the fact that the stakeholders and employers that would love to get rid of all of their human labor are also the same people that can't clearly articulate what they want, so I can imagine while the AI could be very intelligent, it might not be able to translate the mess a stakeholder would give as instruction. \\n\\nNow I'm going to take this out to a bigger level. If AI could replace a software engineer completely, or a graphic or web designer completely, then that means the AI is intelligent enough to replace a lot of people. Why should finance companies hire wealth managers and stockbrokers and other financial gurus when the AI could simply go out and quickly analyze and figure out what to buy and what to sell immediately without any worry?\\n\\nWhy should we even have any other kinds of engineers if the AI can simply quickly draw up blueprints and then use a 3D printer to turn out a prototype?\\n\\nAnd then of course, there's the people that bring up their vocational trade, pretending that somehow they will never be replaced and they will always make loads of money forever.\\n\\nWhat happens if we end up with millions of displaced knowledge workers, and at least a fourth of them decide to go out and learn vocational trades so they can make a living? That means you're now going to have a lot more competition out there, and they're going to be undercutting you, and now you're going to complain that you can't find decent paying work. Isn't this the same complaint I hear about migrants coming in?\\n\\nLet's be brutally honest. If AI could come and replace all of us very quickly, and now human labor has become obsolete, this is not going to just become an issue of where you're going to work, it's going to become an issue of how does society survive. If it comes to the point that there's really no work out there for you beyond retail or some other menial labor that is likely going to be replaced with robots, then that means that you are now obsolete. That the only option for you is to find a nice place to curl up and starve to death.\\n\\nAnd how do companies make money if nobody has any income or money to spend on anything?\\n\\nLet's be brutally honest, society isn't going to go there. And Lord knows if the AI is intelligent enough, then somebody could replace the board with the AI. We could replace our government elected officials with AI. That means anybody could be replaced with AI.\\n\\nIt's a tool. I would tell anyone out here that you should be trying to figure out how to utilize it in your work. I know for me, I'm slapping my forehead today thinking that I should be running content. Then I'm writing for company emails through chat GPT just to see if they can improve on it. I'm using generative AI with Adobe products to do certain kinds of retouching that it would take me hours to do on my own. I'm not necessarily going to let AI completely lay out a web page for me, but I'm not going to sit here being scared of it as if it's going to make me irrelevant.\\n\\nI'm sorry for those out there who can't find a job. It sucks, but I will tell you I've been through this thing after the dotcom crash, watched many more go through it after the housing crash in 2008. This is unfortunately a transitional time in our economy, and everyone's going to have to suffer a little bit until everything settles down and we figure out what the new normal is. I will tell you though, that if you believe everything is so absolutely hopeless right now, then you're pretty much screwed in life. \\n\\nSo take a deep breath, stop being afraid of AI, start figuring out how to better utilize it in your work, and keep at it because eventually these companies are going to have to hire again. They can't sit on their hands forever because the shareholders will start demanding why they are not making new revenue.\\n\\nIf you are a beginner or a junior or somebody that came out of a boot camp with minimal skills, you had better be working on those skills while you are sitting here applying for jobs. Put down the Xbox controller and look for things you can do to build on your skills. Network with people who are working and don't ask them to give you a job or an internship, but ask them what skills they are seeing that everyone is lacking that you should be working on. \\n\\nI know if someone asked me that in UX, I would be happy to try to point out what I think they should be doing. I may not have jobs or internships to give out, but the very least I can do is give out advice.\\n\\nThings will get better.
