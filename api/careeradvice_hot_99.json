Effective immediately. I worked as a data analyst/applications manager/the-only-person-knowledgeable-about-anything-computer-related for a small healthcare group. The company has relied on COVID funding since it's inception, so naturally the funding has dried up and they're downsizing. They (the CEO) took a look at my salary and decided to cut my position, immediately. I had no time to stop what I knew would inevitably happen. Backend processes and automations started crashing, and they will soon be out of compliance with local, state, and federal regulations (they don't realize this yet, and they won't until they get the notice that they're in breach of contract- which could take a few weeks). The contract they're operating under ends in a few months, so I was expecting to be laid off in a few months anyways, but not like this.\\n\\nI've been getting panicked texts and emails ever since saying they want to bring be back on part-time, at a substantially lower rate than I was making. No one, not even my boss, knows how to maintain a spreadsheet, let alone the other applications I implemented to keep their business running smoothly.\\n\\nFrom a business perspective, I don't want to take the part-time, less pay offer. It's insulting. From my personal, guilt-ridden perspective, the company provides healthcare to a vulnerable population, and my co-workers, through no fault of their own, will soon lose the ability to care for these patients.\\n\\nAny advice how to navigate this?\\n\\nTo note: I don't need the job right now, and was actually relieved to be laid off after working in a COVID-response capacity the past 3 and a half years. Financially, I'll be ok if I don't work for a couple months, so while the paycheck would be nice, I don't *need* it. \\\\*acknowledging my privilege to be in such a position\\\\*\\n\\nTLDR: I was laid off 2  days ago with no notice. Things started falling apart. No one knows how to fix it, so they want me back - for less pay.  \\n....\\n\\nUpdate:  Thank you everyone for your recommendations! I've never been laid off or fired before, I've always left on my own. So while I won't be accepting the offer, I didn't know how to respond. I told them I would take the weekend to consider it (make em sweat a bit). I also discovered that they will not be paying out my unused vacation time. I'm torn between straight up rejecting their offer, or countering with the suggestions of charging $200/hr as a contractor to fix things over the next month or so. However, I get the inkling that they're setting up to just let it all burn down. I'm pretty sure the CEO is just pocketing as much profit as possible before the contracts end. \\n\\nThis company poached me from the agency that monitors if they're in compliance. I can easily get a job with them again, and probably with their competitor. I'll be applying for unemployment to tie me over. I don't need a job immediately, so I'm not stressed about that aspect.  \\n\\nUpdate 2: \\nI declined their offer,  stating it was not a suitable offer for my skillset and expertise. I did not counter offer. A corporate lawyer friend advised that it could come across as threatening. I have no regrets. I'm slowly applying for new jobs and have had 1 interview already. I'm mostly enjoying the time off, though, and hope to have another month or so to enjoy the peace.\"", "title": "Company laid me off suddenly, now wants me back for less pay", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/15uz73k/company_laid_me_off_suddenly_now_wants_me_back/"}, {"author": "veggies4evr", "created_utc": 1689360041.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 1284, "post_id": "14zofpf", "score": 3412, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"I work in finance and was told that I cannot be promoted if I have kids.

I furnished the letter to HR as verification. HRkept denying firing me, I kept claiming that they did.  They asked if I wanted to return to work or quit.

The company has protested my claim for unemployment compensation. Do I qualify for unemployment compensation?\\nXxxx'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcccxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcccccccc\\nMore information:\\nThanks Everyone\\nYes. I could have given them the opportunity to straitghten it out.  The letter was from payroll. It stated my benefits were canceled and it stated the reason was that my employment terminated. Before leave HR said my leave was approved. I was concerned that someone needed forms so I asked if there were any forms. They sent me short term disability forms. Then, after the surgery, payroll sent forms to my personal email specifying it was my last chance to submit Leave of Absence forms. HR did not give me these firms when I asked before leave. They simply said I was approved. I was on pain medication, should not have been driving and recovering when I drove the forms back to my doctor. We got them in at 3pm on the day of the deadline.  On the day I stopped working, I was confused. I told them I wanted to speak with an attorney and get some advice. I refused to quit and refused to return to work. HR was blaming payroll, who I consider is part of HR. I felt it was the HR directors fault for not giving me the forms when I asked 2weeks before the leave. I did not want to critisize or argue with her. I was confused so I said very little and did nothing. I wanted to get outside advice.  It felt risky to return to a job after being fired without cause. The conversation happened on a Friday before Thankgiving week and I had to decide the Monday of Thanksgiving week. When I can not decide something i feel its better to do nothing from fear of making a decision that makes it worse. When they forced a decision by Monday I still refused to quit, go back and claimed already being fired. They terminated me by a forced voluntary quit that Monday.  In Iowa, employers can terminate for voluntary quit after 3 days no-show, but they did not allow me 3 days of indecision to abandon the job. HR's letter stated that they could understand the stress it caused me and that they could understand not wanting to continue my employment. Then the letter said that if I did not decide to return by Monday it would be a voluntary quit.\\nI was also on ADA accommodations for mental illness with this company.  I filed for these accomodations several months before. This cancelation of benefits and firing happened just a couple weeks after I lost Medicaid. I had been on the  COVID relief program and had this job and was still on Medicaid and their benefits. Medicaid had just expired after Teo years of full time working when all this happened. I was in a 90 day window where I could renew my Medicaid benefits instead of applying for Medicaid all over again or trust this company to do things right without future mistakes. I attend two weekly therapy groups, see a therapist and take medication to remain employable and healthy. This is more important than the job, unemployment benefits or wrongful termination. Although these would help while I look for a new job. The jobsite is a substance abuse rehabilitation and mental health treatment center.\"", "title": "company mistakenly fired me", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18bcpmh/company_mistakenly_fired_me/"}, {"author": "dr_dante_octivarious", "created_utc": 1685546504.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 340, "post_id": "13wp5tw", "score": 1314, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"So, never been in this position before.

I simply saw an opportunity and took it.\\n\\n- VPs and my boss mainly wanted to hear me out about what I'm going to. I was vague as could be - even the tiny bits that I did divulge (I'm going into data engineering) was met with \\\"we can get you opportunities here to do that.\\\"\\n\\n- My former boss was probably the only one who was understanding. He's a huge champion of the company, so I honestly expected him to be more upset, but he's a reasonable guy who fully understands the need to do what's best for yourself. We both came from the same company previously, and he quit that job before I left - and he didn't have ANYTHING lined up. \\n\\n- The COO came to me with the counter and honestly - it sealed the deal for me leaving. \\n - He brought in IT who were thrilled to have me potentially join their team as a data engineer.

It is a job working in marketing for a Fortune 500 company. \\n\\nYesterday evening, my city\\u2019s division had dinner meeting. At the meeting, mostly everyone drank and spent time discussing work but also personal lives, sports, etc. Most of attendees had a night booked at a hotel so that anyone who wanted to drink would not worry about driving. \\n\\nAs the dinner was wrapping up, myself and 2 other young coworkers decided we wanted to go to one more bar before going to bed. As we were arranging this plan, an older coworker (male, around 50) asked if he could join us. We said it was fine and headed to the bar. \\n\\nAs we were walking in, my ass was slapped two times. I had assumed it was my young female coworker since we are pretty comfortable with each other. We got drinks then the four of us sat down at a table. A few minutes later, the older coworker asked me if I could chat with him at another table, and I said that was fine. \\n\\nThe first few minutes were ok, but then he suddenly asked, \\u201cwould you want to fuck me?\\u201d. I said no and got up to go back to the original table. While I did this, my older coworker went to the restroom. I immediately told my two younger coworkers what happened and they said they watched him slap my ass two times on the way into the bar. I was shocked. \\n\\nAt the same time, my older coworker was walking back to the table so I asked my younger female coworker to go to the restroom with me. For around 10 minutes we discussed the situation and decided the best course of action was just to leave the bar. As we were waiting for our Uber, my older coworker fell completely down out of drunkenness. \\n\\nMy younger male coworker helped him up,  then we got into an Uber that took us back to my apartment building (which is only one block from the hotel the three of them were staying at). When we got out, my older coworker assumed that we would go into my apartment building and into my apartment together. We all said no, but he was being persistent. \\n\\nSo for safety, all four of us walked back to the hotel knowing that after my older coworker got to his hotel room, that I would be able to walk back to my apartment safely. \\n\\nI got home just after midnight and cried for about 30 mins before going to bed. \\n\\nThis older coworker of mine has been with my company for 15+ years, and I\\u2019ve only worked here for 5 months. My direct manager is also an older male, and isn\\u2019t the type to understand the severity of sexual harassment in the workplace. \\n\\nIn 5 months, I\\u2019ve had to complete two separate work harassment training modules, but I still feel as if if this incident was reported to HR that my side would not be taken, even with two witnesses. \\n\\nDo I just let the situation go and going forward avoid interactions with this coworker (who I do not see on a daily basis) or do I report it to HR? \\n\\nI want to choose whichever option has a neutral impact on my job and position within the company. I want to report it, but I feel as if all of my coworkers would hate me since my older coworker is loved by so many. \\n\\nHas anyone faced this same or a similar situation and has advice?

I feel more inclined to respond directly to a message on LinkedIn and it's also a great way to show your interest in the role. A candidate is now moving onto the 3rd and final interview because she did this (based on her resume, she probably wouldn't have received an interview at all).\\n* With the above, just remember that hiring managers and recruiters are receiving hundreds, if not thousands, of applications, so this is just advice on increasing your odds in moving to the next round of interviews.\"", "title": "As a hiring manager in this crazy job market, I recommend you include a cover letter (and some other advice included)", "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/12cke6a/as_a_hiring_manager_in_this_crazy_job_market_i/"}, {"author": "J0hntheSavage", "created_utc": 1689429797.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 546, "post_id": "150cvgd", "score": 622, "subreddit": "careeradvice", "text": "\"I always hear of these boring jobs/careers that are relatively low effort and stress but pay over 6 figures.

I've spent 20+ years in a variety of industries, and have learned the following:\\n\\n1. No matter how stuck you may feel at your current job, there is ALWAYS a light at the end of the tunnel\\n2. Always ask the hard questions in a job interview (how much you expect to make, training period, what is the culture like, why has  this position opened up). Remember, you are interviewing that company just as much as they are interviewing you.\\n3. Don't like your job? Instead of complaining, DO something. Work on your resume. Send out 1-2 applications a night. Look at the many free resources online for a new skill. You are the only person responsible for where you're at in life and you have the power to change it\\n4. Applying to jobs is time consuming. It is difficult. It can be demotivating. Allow yourself to feel those negative feelings about that process, but keep going! The right opportunity will present itself\\n5. Be professional and polite to everyone, even if they're the biggest jerk. Why? You could be standing next to the person who will open some of the biggest doors you'll ever walk through\\n6. Learn to recognize the signs of burnout or increased stress within yourself. It may be time to start looking for a new job when you start to dread waking up in the morning, or are having panic attacks\\n7. At each job you have, learn to recognize where you excel and where you need to improve. Any employer no matter what industry will highly value someone who can self-evaluate their own capabilities\\n8. Learn to say **I do not know how to do that, but I can learn or research it**. Why? No one knows everything and the worst thing you can do is put yourself in boiling water due to overestimating  or lying your abilities or skills\\n9. Do not live for your job. Your job is there to support the lifestyle you want to create for yourself; it should not be the center of your universe; it may not be there tomorrow\\n10.

I am 43, no college degree, and after finding what I thought was a great career for me, interest rates went up, market went down, and the job/career was no longer a viable option in February.  Cue some depression as I finally thought I had things figured out and wasted a year training at 40k, a significant salary reduction for me.\\n\\nNow to the issue.  I've applied a lot, but companies are slow to hire.  I applied for a county job in a field I was interested in, knowing the pay range.  After about 7 weeks, I finally got the offer....at $19.25/hr.  Great benefits as it's a government job and a pension for the future.  I accepted the job as I had no other offers and figure I'm a hard worker, I can move up and the pension will be nice. Start date is tomorrow. \\n\\nLast week, I had an interview for a job with a large insurance company.  I did it for practice and because $19.25/hr...at 43 with a strong resume. Starting salary for this role was $50K.  I then met with HR who informed me if selected, it will actually start at $59k with a $2k sign on bonus, and a bonus every year that could be from 3-8k approximately. It's a big enough company that benefits are OK, and while no pension, very generous 401k match increasing yearly.  \\n\\nI expect an offer for the other job in the next day or two.  Both jobs are 75% work from home, the county job has a little more flexibility with hours. I know long term, my options with the County will be plentiful, but at 43, long term is not my only concern.  A 50% difference is pay plus bonuses just feels like I can't pass it up.  My wife also works and makes about 100k with bonuses, so it's not like we can't survive on the lower job,  it just means putting off things we've been wanting to do.   \\n\\nI would feel bad leaving a job 3 days into training abd likely would never be eligible for government roles again, but its just such a big difference in compensation.
