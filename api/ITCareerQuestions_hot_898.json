Despite being diagnosed with autism and ADHD, I've worked hard to overcome these challenges and not let them hinder my career. It may be a struggle sometimes, but I work hard at it.  \\nI started as a tech enthusiast and hobbyist at the age of 8 and later worked in desktop technical support and repair. I attended college for networking as part of an apprenticeship, and then continued with the role for a little bit, but decided I wanted to move to a new city, and take some years to study UX/UI, hoping to find the right career path for me. I knew one day I'd like to run a business, but I feel like the risk and the capital availability for that are not available at the moment, so being my own boss is more of a fantasy atm. \\n\\nI landed a job as a UX/UI designer at a startup during my final months of university, but I found myself overwhelmed and underqualified, as the sole UX/UI designer I was managing far too many flows for my skill level, and brand graphics and other responsibilities that were extremely tough for me, combined. I left the company after several months.  \\nAfter a few months of job searching, and a long struggle to recoup emotionally and physically from the stress, I found a role that combined deployment and business operations. It was a really fun role, and happened to also be remote and involve a tiny bit of travel. It was with a fun product, and a fun team but unfortunately, I was laid off with a bunch of other employees after about 8 months due to the company's shrinking customer base, and the extremely risky market that company played in.   \\nDesperate for a stable income, I returned to a sysadmin role at a company with a great reputation. I've been there for a few weeks, now. Despite enjoying the work and the company culture, I'm concerned about the steep learning curve and my ability to prove my skills compared to my colleagues. I'm also worried about the possibility of being laid off again, or having too high of a training cost, as I'm still recovering from the financial and emotional impact of my last layoff. I'm getting the hang of things fast, but I don't have many indicators to work with on that. It is starting to affect my sleep, and my stress, as I really like it here, but I'm feeling a bit uncertain. I really hope I can snap out of this, because I want to keep at it, and I really want to be at a role for several years again. I haven't done that since before university.  \\nI'm hoping to keep this sysadmin job for a few years and train myself towards a career in DevOps, as I enjoy working with the development pipeline, constant learning, Linux, and longer-term projects. This is also because there is an internal path to DevOps here, and I think my enthusiasm for both development and systems administration could be a benefit to the team. I feel like this aligns with my experience so far, but given the current economy, I don't think it's the right time for a risky career switch. I'm feeling uncertain as to where to take my career, and as I'm prioritizing stability at the moment, I'm aware that I might not get to work on what I want to at the moment, as I need to take time to build trust.   \\nI have a few questions:  \\n\\n\\n* How can I effectively upskill outside of my current job to make myself more valuable and reduce the risk of unemployment?\\n* What are some strategies for coping with the fear and anxiety of potential job loss, especially as someone with autism who struggles with constant change?\\n* Given my background in UX/UI and my current role as a sysadmin, what skills should I focus on developing to make a smooth transition into a DevOps role in the future? Should I look at honing a language further? Do I work on my people skills?\\n* How can I better showcase my skills and prove my value in my current role, despite the steep learning curve? This company mostly works on cloud compute, virtualisation, and networking here at this level, I think.\\n* Are there any specific certifications or training programs you would recommend for someone in my position looking to move into a DevOps career?  \\n\\n\\nThank you all. I know it's a lot.

I have not been able to get used to working at night. I feel tired all the time and my overall well-being is shot.\\n\\nGoing into the building every night is soul crushing.

I do one project every night which takes about an hour at 4 am. Tell me again why I have to stay in the same room all shift?\\n\\nI feel like I am doing more paperwork than IT work and 5 managers have to approve every email you send. This leads me not to care about the work whatsoever.\\n\\nPlus they all know various levels of windows and none of it is good because they live and breathe linux so when I (an experience windows sysadmin) am going too fast for them, they freak out and yell at me to stop doing things that way. Against the way they had been trained. They also never believe me when I say I can do basic troubleshooting on my own.\\n\\nPeople act like everything is super important when in reality nothing is. Oh site is down? Wait until next shift. Send the ticket up the food chain, ask the guy on site to fix it. Oh we don't understand what to do on this project and nobody is awake to help? delay until the next maintenance window. This leads me not to care about the work whatsoever.\\n\\nIt is a culture of fear in that they keep stating how nobody knows anything, but people keep getting promoted. Blackout days for PTO and timecard punching is paramount despite being on salary. Oh yeah and let's not forget to tell you that two people died of strokes/heart attacks in the room.\\n\\nI am a very ambitious person and I feel like my skills have already stagnated. Despite getting 1-2 certs. I miss windows admin. I also miss doing some user support. But the most important part of all is I miss feeling useful. I know a lot of people will kill for this job, but I don't like just pushing buttons and running random scripts I can't change or come up with on my own. Plus there's no cloud systems so if I ever want to go back to private I will have a much harder time then right now.\\n\\nThere are little promotions that happen between the teams that take about 1-2 years to come up around the same teams doing the same thing only higher level tiers that would still be regular system admins in the private sector. The way my team is set now I feel like level .05. Then there's level I and level II. Then Engineering and Cyber.\\n\\nPros The only pros are that it is literally impossible to get fired from this job and my higher level bosses have been pretty good and try to accommodate everyone. We had a tech who brought down nationwide sites which made headline news and he is still working here. I think he even got promoted eventually.\\n\\nThe pay is also slightly higher than most of the offers I have been seeing.

Before I came to the US over a year ago, I had a good couple months of experience working with CRM software (Zoho) as a business systems analyst of sorts for an internet service provider back in my home country.\\n\\nAt the time, the company had just recently acquired the software so my CEO was looking for ways to maximize it since he had spent a lot of money on the entire zoho suite. So my job at the time was the study the software and look for ways we could use it to make our processes more efficient. During this time, I found out about the workflow automation feature, I would meet with sales/marketing, discuss existing processes and find out a way to automate the entire process. In addition to this, I would create lead assignment rules, create low code customs apps using Zoho creator and create charts and dashboards for sales data. \\n\\nI really enjoyed my work during this time so I would research more about automations in general, where I came across Microsoft power apps and power automate so I began to study them. Eventually when I moved to the US for an MBA, I found out that salesforce and Microsoft dynamics were the go to ERP/CRM platforms rather than Zoho. \\n\\nSo I think my question is this. Should I consolidate myself in the CRM/ERP analyst type role or should I go the way of the Microsoft Power Platform developer type role? Which of these roles pays better and has better career prospects in the US? Or are they not even that good compared say a cloud engineer role for instance?\\n\\nMy bachelors degree was in Information Systems with a concentration in software development so I am fairly proficient in coding, that is why the power platform appeals to me but it doesnt seem to be as lucrative as the CRM role.

Basically there a lot of expectations from customers (think 100% availability, 100% confidentiality, 100% integrity at all times or you get a call), and a not so great setup for ticket routing. basically any ticket created is something I may touch, which is fine, but if it isn't resolvable in an apparent way, and has taken me half a day to get to that realization, there is no mechanism to move the ticket away from me to lets say.. an L2 or L3 person. The ticket is stuck with you and you with it, and only another person in the same L1 position with the same general skillsets will ever really take it from you. Generally speaking difficult tickets can stick to you for weeks as you try pull more people in to assist, all the while you're still getting fed more tickets. As some may imagine, it becomes a difficult juggling process if you happen to get multiple tricky long term tickets and no way to route them away from yourself.  \\n\\n\\nBasically my question is this. How much of a network or system admin's life is taking tickets, and how much is projects? I think I would fair much better if I was able to be the captain my own ship and could work projects to improve things, without feeling so tied to the ticket system. As it stands, I feel like I'm constantly trying to stamp out fires and have very little time to do fun things like projects, research, and adding to the internal knowledge base.  \\n\\n\\n  \\nPlease tell me there is a place for someone like me in those positions!

So my job at the time was the study the software and look for ways we could use it to make our processes more efficient. During this time, I found out about the workflow automation feature, I would meet with sales/marketing, discuss existing processes and find out a way to automate the entire process. In addition to this, I would create lead assignment rules, create low code customs apps using Zoho creator and create charts and dashboards for sales data. \\n\\nI really enjoyed my work during this time so I would research more about automations in general, where I came across Microsoft power apps and power automate so I began to study them. Eventually when I moved to the US for an MBA, I found out that salesforce and Microsoft dynamics were the go to ERP/CRM platforms rather than Zoho. \\n\\nSo I think my question is this. Should I consolidate myself in the CRM/ERP analyst type role or should I go the way of the Microsoft Power Platform developer type role? Which of these roles pays better and has better career prospects in the US?

I am interested in cybersecurity and would like to pursue a career in that field, but unfortunately, there are no cybersecurity degree programs available in my province. So, Im left between Computer Science, Data Science, or Information systems.\\n\\n\\nThe Information Systems program appears to be a good choice as it offers many transferable credits, which means that almost two years' worth of courses I've already completed can be applied towards the degree. However, it is essentially the same program that I completed for my diploma, and I am uncertain about the potential opportunities it might limit once I've graduated since it is more geared towards programming. (After completing an IT-related program, my university offers two cybersecurity certificates, which is the most likely path during or after my degree.) \\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Data Science program is a brand-new offering that caught my attention. It covers various courses in fields such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning that I find really interesting. Unfortunately, it does not provide any transferable credits except for 3 congregated courses. Which would mean I would spend another 4 years in school.\\n\\n\\nI can't do math for shit, so cs isn't an option for me.  \\n\\n\\nMy question is whether the title of the degree is more important or the fact that I have one in the first place and back it up with the certifications and other skills that I have gained outside of that degree.

Your right, nothing good can come from just staying in my comfort zone, got my resignation letter and handing in tomorrow!\\n\\nCurrently at a crossroads on what to do and where to take my career. Currently I work as a sysadmin for an MSP. We get contracted out to different school districts and I have been contracted out to this one school for the last 8 years. Over the years I have gone from a L1 break fix helpdesk tech to their senior sys admin in charge of all the infrastructure, security and cloud. The MSP I work for has been good to me but the pay and benefits arent that great. Right now I currently make 90k a year, I get 12 PTO days a year, I commute about 2.5 hours a day to and from my site 5 days a week. The other plus side is I have gotten pretty high in the MSP, so much so that now they rely on me to create security standards to implement across all the sites, create different cloud standards to implement etc. I sorta have been pulled into the manager inner circle so to speak.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nToday I got a call from a friend who works with this company. They are a massive company and are in need of a sysadmin to help in one of their offices. The office has about 180 users, so its pretty small office (satellite office). I would be doing exactly what im doing now but it would be remote 4 days a week, 120k salary and unlimited PTO. This all sounds great but I feel like I would be starting from scratch again.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTo give some more perspective, Im 28 years old and live in NY. My wife and I are looking to start a family soon and the extra money and more PTO would definitely be a benefit. I wasnt planning on leaving anytime soon since I decided to go back to school and get my bachelors. I was going to wait until I completed both my bachelors and masters before considering anything but now the offer has come up im not sure what to do. \\n\\nI am pretty comfortable where I am now which I guess is contributing alot to my doubts about the new job.

The support I've provided is on the technical side for ERP solutions. Lately, the job is not fulfilling anymore, and I don't see any further career growth in the company I'm currently in. The pay is not bad, but getting a promotion or a raise has become difficult.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nTherefore, I'm considering changing my career path to something more general/technical. What I mean by this is that specializing in ERP solutions is very company-specific, therefore that knowledge is not that useful when applying to new jobs. Also, I would like to be in a more high-paying area. Some people say money should not be a factor in this, but in reality, I think it is a big factor to consider.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nDuring college, I always did well in programming subjects and web programming has been something I've always had an interest in, but I've never done it professionally. Coming from a technical support background, I think it'll be kind of difficult to change my career path to a programming job, so I would like to get advice on the following:\\r  \\n\\r  \\n1. Has anyone gone through the same situation which is changing from the technical support field to programming or something different? Was it difficult?\\n\\n2. Is web programming a good area to change to? Is it a \\\"good-paying\\\" area?\\n\\n3. Are there any IT better areas than programming to change to?\\r  \\n\\r\\n\\n4.

He said he could put me in contact with people he trusted at firms who did, but I didn\\u2019t want to go down that road for a gig I wasn\\u2019t even confident existed.\\n\\nFast forward to last week, and I get hit up on LinkedIn by a recruiter from Insight Global, which is apparently a VERY known name, with a nearly identical job description for the same client.  It was much better written and had some slightly different details, but it\\u2019s essentially the same gig. \\n\\nNow for my actual question\\u2026\\u2026.do I go back to my boss at the recruiting firm and ask him to go talk to his contact, or do I respond to this other recruiter and go through them?  \\n\\nOn the plus side with the Insight recruiter, they actually bothered reading my LinkedIn profile, don\\u2019t send up any serious red flags, and already have a definite \\u201cin\\u201d with the job.

That usually means talking to department managers or industry veteran recruiters.  My hope is that Insight being the big deal they are means they have better training and support for their staff than most (which they actually claim to be the case) or this recruiter is just has a jetpack strapped to them, otherwise they might not be so sure of a bet.\\n\\nAs for going through my current firm, they\\u2019ve done very good by me and they know my work so well that they talked me into applying for my current job, even though I didn\\u2019t think my skills matched it.  I also know they\\u2019ve been around for a while, have a very good reputation in the local IT community, and really do have the kinds of contacts that could potentially get my foot in the door on this other job.  That said, if I go through them, I would effectively be asking them to hand me over to their competition for a job I don\\u2019t even know for sure those people have access to.

Everyday I see posts here and on other related subreddits (cough cscarrerquestions cough) - \\\"How do I gain experience in IT\\\" or \\\"How do I break into cybersecurity\\\" or \\\"Had my first IT interview and now I'm depressed\\\" (sorry for any callouts). In general, there is a common theme of misplaced expectations. Whether what it means to \\\"gain IT experience\\\", what a \\\"cybersecurity role\\\" looks like in it's day-to-day, or as in that recent thread not understanding the baseline level of understanding to contribute in an entry-level IT role.\\n\\nEnough rambling, what did I really mean by IT is information technology? Well, exactly that. It's nothing more or less than information technology. It's the support of information systems and their technologies; but for what purpose?\\n\\nThe answer is, to support business goals and outcomes.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, let's take another look. How does IT contribute to a businees's goals and it's desired outcomes? Here's a few: migrating users and their files from a deprecated platform to another supported platform (that may introduce new capabilities to drive and support additional business goals and outcomes), implementing a new system and related processes to start supporting business departments that were previously outsourced (when operating a business process in-house is either more economical or strategic for the business such as HR/payroll/hosting/etc.), or perhaps automating a business function or process (driving further value in an organization's value chain by improving a proceses return on it's inputs and outputs). These are a few but this is far from exhausting all the ways IT contributes.\\n\\nMaybe that wasn't the most straightforward way to answer the question posed. IT exists to support business outcomes (managing system lifecycles while reducing operational impact to business), enabling new business opoortunities our outcomes (introducing and/or enabling IT capabilities for the business), or improving the efficiencies of existing business processes to drive better business outcomes (drive higher returns of investment on busienss value chains through the implementation of information technologies). Hopefully better than the above description?\\n\\nThe takeaway is, information technology is an aspect that describes the domain of technical knowledge to achieve all of the above. It's not the end all be all, it's just become so broad and applicable that it's become it's own beast. But the areas of IT domains are quite inclusive, and at the end of the day it exists to drive and support business outcomes. Keep that top of mind when looking for jobs that may interest you, or if you're stuck on a question from an interviewer and not sure how to answer. Ask clarifying questions that may hint, what value or contribution would this IT-related discussion bring to a business? Is it core to their business model, or in support of that core? Is that something I can support?\\n\\nAlright, I'll leave it here for now and see if the community responds at all to the message. I can go all day on the topic, but no point unless it's heard. I'm a relatively frequent poster on these subreddits (feel free to check my posts. just don't come at me for my opinions lol), and have been itching to make a post similar to this for some time, so I hope it lands somwhere it can be appreciated. I had started a discord to be able to provide some more direct feedback and to try to foster a community of those that understand we're doing the needful in IT. I don't want to get banned though, so I'll refrain from any direct references to it here for now.

This effort was driven by a need for higher income; my previous role's $45k annual salary barely covered my travel expenses and tuition, despite working full-time.  \\nMy job search began in earnest around November, with offers ranging between $55k and $62k, yet nothing reached my $65k minimum expectation. Despite applying to 70-80 roles via LinkedIn, only about four offers came through at $55k, $58k, $62k, and finally $70k. Many applications ended in ghosting or outright rejections, and the few offers I did receive often had untenable client requirements, such as being on-call and ready to travel hours to another state site for troubleshooting.  \\nIn interviews, I frequently reached the final rounds, meeting with team leads and CIOs, but the offers were never compelling enough. My previous role as a Junior Network Support had me on-site, moving between clients, which made the days go by quickly. Despite its helpdesk-like duties with some network troubleshooting, it offered variety and pace.  \\nUltimately, I accepted the $70k offer primarily for the pay increase and the company's clear path for promotion and lateral movement, though the role is similar to my previous one but with more desk time.  \\nThis journey taught me valuable lessons about navigating the job market.

Engaging a recruiter was a turning point, leading to an interview, offer, and onboarding within this turbulent six-month period.  \\nThe experience was a rollercoaster of emotions, feeling alternately hopeless, underqualified, or overqualified. However, it underscored the importance of having a clear goal and a plan to achieve it.

I want to work in IT im really good with computers and I know most of the knowledge you\\u2019d need (I dropped out of college even though i did the full first year course don\\u2019t ask I was young and doing law maths IT and psychology). I want to know my best route of getting into this, I would even do an apprenticeship at this age. I recently lost my job because they got rid of the whole telesales team and although I have loads of interviews its not what I want to do my whole life. Can people help me? I know I can pay for programs where id gain qualifications and study in my own time but these seem longwinded and I get a feeling they are just ripping me off? Whenever I enquire they use all pushy sales tactics to get me to buy the course sooner than I need, I see right through the sales tactics.

Despite the fact that my first higher education is related to IT, I dream of becoming a lawyer. I'm already a lawyer in Ukraine and have great achievements.\\r  \\nBut British immigration requirements are changing. For this reason, I decided to work in IT for immigration so that I could then focus on what I like.\\r  \\nI need help choosing an IT profession. Why? Because all I know about them is theory. Practical experience may vary.\\r  \\nSo my point a:\\r  \\nBachelor of Computer Engineering.\\r  \\nI learned different programming languages, SQL, Linux, development methodologies and many other topics, since my first step in development was more than 10 years ago (I'm 22 now).\\r  \\nBut I hate writing code. Or rather, I'm afraid of not being able to cope with the task.\\r  \\nI probably could learn something that is developed using approximately the same algorithms, the same backend of sites, etc., but this requires the use of Python, for example. However, I like C#, I can talk for a very long time about the advantages of C# over Python. But as I know, C# developers face new tasks and challenges every day. And I'm just afraid I won't be able to manage it.\\r  \\nI'm blind. That means I can't do visual work, frontend work, drawing diagrams, etc.\\r  \\nWhat do I like to do besides using apps and games? Make applications and games ideas and plan technical implementation. For example, I like to come up with an idea, decide what programming language and technology stack I could use, hire a developer, and oversee the implementation of the idea.\\r  \\nI need an IT profession more for immigration, as a temporary solution for 5 years, but it would be nice if I could develop skills to solve personal tasks.\\r  \\nThere are dozens of IT professions. I will not write what I think about each of them, I would like to write here about the closest to me from what I heard or read:\\r  \\nQA: no, the manual testing routine doesn't seem attractive to me. But requirements testing! Searching for contradictions, unclear provisions of requirements, all this sounds interesting. But in fact, as I know, most QAs test the interface, which I cannot do, and Junior QAs are not allowed to test requirements;\\r  \\nAnalytics: No, I don't like to research and analyze something. I have my business ideas, and even for them I would find a business analyst to analyze the market and draw up a business plan. But some analysts, as I heard, are engaged in planning technical implementation, which I like. Moreover, systems analysts sometimes do as architects. Become an architect without development experience? Dream! But as I know, analysts are supposed to draw diagrams, which I can't do. I know some blind analysts, but they say they depend on their colleagues for diagrams;\\r  \\nProject and Product manager: a product manager is probably more attractive, but as I heard, without experience it is unlikely to become one of the managers;\\r  \\nSupport: low paid and unpromising;\\r  \\nDevops: I've heard many times over the past 5 years that I should try this, but I haven't looked into it yet.\\r  \\nI believe that to make the right choice, I need real experience in the company to see and understand each role.

Currently finishing being trained to be a lead cloud engineer where I\\u2019ll be doing the same work + managing / training a small team for projects. I\\u2019ve already been doing this for some time now, but will now be in an official capacity. On a high level, typical projects are migrations from on-prem to cloud. My experience revolves around designing and building the entire azure infra, implementing intune and migrating devices, designing and implementing the defender / defender for cloud suite and sentinel. I\\u2019m also outsourced for advanced support tickets for several clients; basically help desk but for the IT staff. \\n\\n4 YoE as a radio operator / radio chief in the marine corps. It\\u2019s an IT adjacent role, but not your typical help desk. Lots of troubleshooting radios, basic networking, managing cryptographic keys for secure comms, building SoPs and lots of documentation, and managing a team. \\n\\nI hold an active secret clearance, several certs from azure and comptia, and am currently in college for a B.S. in cloud computing (azure track). \\n\\nWhat more can I do besides continue building up my YoE? Does anyone have any tips or have potentially similar experiences such as myself to break that 6 figure salary?

It also has a some basic dashboards, a drop zone to upload and process files, some REST endpoints for other things, and some other functionality...

I feel quite lost.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**This post requires some backstory. If it's a too long of a read, you can skip to the bolded text and read from there. Thank you.**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nA few years ago, when I had zero skills and no experience, just a young guy in his early 20's, I was working as Tech Support in a call center for a Cellular company (Think AT&T or Vodafone). The job obviously had low pay, was quite stressful and generally not a great experience. I eventually made the decision to study and get a certification and managed to study and pass a CCNA certification. With that course finished and certification in hand, I immediately started looking for a new position that I could move up to within my organization (And planning to look outwards if I cannot find one). Fairly quickly I found and applied to one in my company and managed to get accepted into my current position that I have been on for 2-3 years, being 'NOC' (Network Operating Center) with networking Emphasis.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe pay increase was fairly significant for me, going up instantly by 150% an hour, with some more economical and company benefits as well. It also felt great not having to constantly talk to angry customers with a headset for 8-9 hours a day anymore.\\r  \\nIn my position, my entire job is in-front of two monitors and revolves around reacting to various networking related Alarms and Emails. The Alarms can be both statistical that require me to read models/graphs of impacted company services or directly relating to hardware (Switches/Routers).\\r  \\nI connect to Firewalls (Checkpoint, Palo Alto, FortiGate) to review logs (Looking for 'Drops/Blocks' due to some complaint) and I create objects/rules (Though it goes through the CSecurity team first).\\r  \\nI connect to various machines through RDP or VMWare, though most of my involvement there is to erase logs, resets services, or run an existing script.\\r  \\nI also connect to many networking equipment, different Switches and Routers, mostly Cisco and Juniper, though most of my work there revolves around review logs / showing interfaces, and either shutting the interfaces up and down, or using some command that I was given prior to use.\\r  \\nA lot of issues, especially networking ones, require me to ring up or email our T2, which are the network engineers/supports (Mostly are people who worked in my position for 5+ years and eventually promoted, usually through connections, though their workload and rather slight pay increase doesn't seem that worth it honestly).\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe job is also a 24/7 position, so every day I do different shifts, can be morning, evening or even night shifts. Which are starting to strain me, especially where it's quite often where I do a Night shift, into an evening shift, into a morning shift, which is really draining me.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe workload is relatively low. There are sometimes \\\"downtimes\\\" where nothing happens, where I can just chill until something does. Making it a generally low-stress environment for me (No remote work unfortunately though). The pay doesn't seem to really increase other than an obligatory 3% yearly.\\r  \\nThe position is entirely from my chair, with no physical involvement. Both my boss and his higher up like me, aren't demanding or stressful, my Co-workers are quite nice as well.\\r  \\nSadly, Everything I solve is either an issue that has a predetermined solution that I was either taught directly before or is in our documentations that I simply need to apply. More difficult issues require the instant escalation of various Networking Experts and Engineers above me. I've mostly learned all the position has to offer, though of course some tiny pieces of knowledge sprout once every month or so.\\r  \\nI have tenure in my position, as the workplace is unionized.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nHonestly no one really teaches you anything there, other than the bare minimum that requires you to do your job, and it's okay with them, since you're expected to escalate whenever you're stuck, or the issue is critical anyways.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**So overall, I'm currently overall simply a Tier 1 NOC, that isn't really gaining any new skillsets or connections, and is sort of stuck in a rather dead end, yet very comfortable position.**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nA friend of mine who is working as a developer in a Startup Company, was trying to help me, and landed me an interview for the High-tech Startup company he's working in. However, he didn't have any real details as it's obviously not something he's involved with himself. My first interview was right away directly with my potential future boss, who asked me about what I do and what I know. Afterwards he described what he's looking for - A tier 2-3 sort of guy, that knows everything from Networking, Cloud, Virtualization, Windows Administration, Active directory and more. He called it an \\\"IT Specialist\\\" position. He said although there's a part time student that does Helpdesk work, as they are fairly a small team, such things would also be expected of me at times as well, though he was unclear, seemingly deliberately of how often this is going to be the case. Surprised by everything I hear, from the seemingly high ceiling of requirements, and with the odd combination of \\\"low-level\\\" helpdesk sort of work was really odd to me. I also admitted to him that from what he's describing, it doesn't like I'm what he's looking for, as I'm far less experienced as a T1 in some of these fields and have zero experience with most others.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nRegardless of this interview, I seemed to continue on, having 3 or so more interview with various people, which sort of continued to rehash the seemingly high demands that I'm clearly not fit for, while having very basic questions (Such as, difference between TCP/UDP, reading the meaning of a presented rule from a FW, how would I troubleshoot X).\\r  \\nAt that point, I was simply going through with the interviews, since they were all remote, short, and I wanted some experience with those type of interviews.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nTo my surprise, I got accepted, somehow. Most likely because my friend really vouched for me.\\r  \\nThey offered me pay that is somewhat higher than my current one (Even if I do my weekends, and some night shifts), and a more structured schedule. The pay would be global, not hourly, and I'll work 9 to 18. There will be no remote work, and the commute will be somewhat longer.\\r  \\nI don't live in the US or in Western Europe, so salaries are a bit lower here. For comparison's sake, I earn between 3,350 to 4200 dollars before tax, depending on the amount of hours, the amount of night shifts and weekends I did. While in the new job I'll learn almost consistently, roughly 4700.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThe main issue is that, the position itself is very very vague. I tried asking the employer, many times what is it that I'm exactly going to do, but the answers where always \\\"Everything\\\", and \\\"Every day something different is required\\\". He throws around various topic such as Networking, and Cloud, but I couldn't get him to give me an examples, other than \\\"Setting up a VLAN for a new environment\\\".\\r  \\nIt also seems quite clear, that at least a partial part of my work, though once again it's not clear how much of it, will also be some Helpdesk/Support.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nEverywhere I read, people say that although job titles are rather meaningless, in almost all cases, NOC positions are generally what people from IT move up from. So it feels like going in reverse.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**I don't really know what to do, on one end, I'll increase my pay, I'll get to experience how it to work in a high-tech company, especially a Startup, I'll earn more money, and maybe even meet some talented people. And potentially I'll get to learn new things.**\\r  \\n**On the other hand, I'm going into a place where I won't have a guarantee I won't get laid off, I'll have far more workload than I have now, I'll have no Night shifts and weekend work sure, but the longer working hours and commute will make so that i'll generally have less free time. And what's worse I don't even exactly know what my position is. I'm afraid that I'll end up being mostly a Helpdesk/support, and only occasionally, if I self-learn new things and \\\"prove myself\\\" I'll get to touch and experience more things.**\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI waited a few days and I need to make my decision 'today'. I'm so stressed of either making a mistake in moving, or refusing and actually losing an opportunity.\"", "title": "NOC into IT Specialist?

The opportunity was a new role as a Noc/Pos/Tech support (inbound calls from clients [aka stores and their employees], nationwide).\\n\\n\\nThe training for this job was less than a month long and sort of an overload of information. We had to learn all about hardware, network configurations (modem-firewall-switch-backups (& WAPs), ports, connection types, and more. Stuff I believe you would know or would have learned about if studying or certified with comptia A+. \\n\\n\\nI'll reiterate that I've never taken the course and had some knowledge just from sort of being into tech myself. I mean some other hardware stuff we had to know about was POS specific, so like cash drawers, label printers, network printers, barcode scanners, pin pads, land lines, UTDs, and a few different type of POS setups in totality. I was also taught how to look for outages using ISPs website and apps, solar winds, Fortigate and manager for the firewalls, about IP and DNS, pinging and really troubleshooting issues with the hardware by the first basic troubleshooting of unplugging, repeating cables, trying different things out to make sure power was being provided and much more on physical hardware.\\n\\n\\nI will say I learned quite a bit in less than a month on how to configured a whole store with all that hardware into a network stack properly and how to calibrate, update, and keep it all working through various tricks such as special ways to reseat cables to power cycle a special way and how to navigate through all the hardwares setups to either Lan or wifi across multiple POSs. I also learned the whole ticketing system (Jira), how to speak on the phone and walk people who weren't tech savvy through rats nests and various solutions, which is much hard imo never really seeing all this equipment except in pictures and not being able to see what they see in person. So, it took sometime just going based on a few pictures to really understand how it all works together in a whole stores network stack. \\n\\n\\nWe also help manage the TVs and traffic counters. To top all this off, we have learned how to go through firewall configurations, run through scripts, read data, and manipulate it through .ini files, mdb files, and xml for different data. That would include looking for how a transaction went through, sales, employee info, and much more data. We were also taught SQL, and how to use the command line so when we remote in we can fix our servers missing files or updates or POS, there were all case scenarios to update software and find files for various hardware if the other hardware troubleshooting didn't work. \\n\\n\\nWe also were slowly being pushed into AD (active directory) There is a bunch of other stuff we do on top of all this and it was boiled down into a few weeks of training for someone with no experience. I will say I'm a fast learner and consider myself tech savvy without a degree.

So I'm sticking it out to find if this was a blessing in disguise, and going through this boot camp/hell in such a short time frame for this company is what I needed to break into IT? \\n\\n\\nI mean like I said previously, I've learned so much in less than a month from the training and job itself, from hardware for stores, to network stacks, the flow of tickets and getting new hardware shipped out, configs, databases, terminal/programming, software, maintaining it all at a huge corporate level for all the company stores. I feel like though the pay is shitty, to the point fast food makes about the same amount maybe like a dollar less, that I can use this to work a year or two and really look for a nice/comfy paying it job if I keep at it. \\n\\n\\nAny suggestions or advice?

I feel quite lost.  \\n\\r  \\n**This post requires some backstory. If it's a too long of a read, you can skip to the bolded text and read from there. Thank you.**  \\n\\r  \\nA few years ago, when I had zero skills and no experience, just a young guy in his early 20's, I was working as Tech Support in a call center for a Cellular company (Think AT&T or Vodafone). The job obviously had low pay, was quite stressful and generally not a great experience. I eventually made the decision to study and get a certification and managed to study and pass a CCNA certification. With that course finished and certification in hand, I immediately started looking for a new position that I could move up to within my organization (And planning to look outwards if I cannot find one). Fairly quickly I found and applied to one in my company and managed to get accepted into my current position that I have been on for 2-3 years, being 'NOC' (Network Operating Center) with networking Emphasis.\\n\\nThe pay increase was fairly significant for me, going up instantly by 150% an hour, with some more economical and company benefits as well. It also felt great not having to constantly talk to angry customers with a headset for 8-9 hours a day anymore.  \\n In my position, my entire job is in-front of two monitors and revolves around reacting to various networking related Alarms and Emails. The Alarms can be both statistical that require me to read models/graphs of impacted company services or directly relating to hardware (Switches/Routers).  \\nI connect to Firewalls (Checkpoint, Palo Alto, FortiGate) to review logs (Looking for 'Drops/Blocks' due to some complaint) and I create objects/rules (Though it goes through the CSecurity team first).  \\nI connect to various machines through RDP or VMWare, though most of my involvement there is to erase logs, resets services, or run an existing script.  \\nI also connect to many networking equipment, different Switches and Routers, mostly Cisco and Juniper, though most of my work there revolves around review logs / showing interfaces, and either shutting the interfaces up and down, or using some command that I was given prior to use.  \\nA lot of issues, especially networking ones, require me to ring up or email our T2, which are the network engineers/supports (Mostly are people who worked in my position for 5+ years and eventually promoted, usually through connections, though their workload and rather slight pay increase doesn't seem that worth it honestly).\\n\\n\\r  \\nThe job is also a 24/7 position, so every day I do different shifts, can be morning, evening or even night shifts. Which are starting to strain me, especially where it's quite often where I do a Night shift, into an evening shift, into a morning shift, which is really draining me.\\n\\nThe workload is relatively low. There are sometimes \\\"downtimes\\\" where nothing happens, where I can just chill until something does. Making it a generally low-stress environment for me (No remote work unfortunately though). The pay doesn't seem to really increase other than an obligatory 3% yearly.  \\nThe position is entirely from my chair, with no physical involvement. Both my boss and his higher up like me, aren't demanding or stressful, my Co-workers are quite nice as well.  \\nSadly, Everything I solve is either an issue that has a predetermined solution that I was either taught directly before or is in our documentations that I simply need to apply. More difficult issues require the instant escalation of various Networking Experts and Engineers above me. I've mostly learned all the position has to offer, though of course some tiny pieces of knowledge sprout once every month or so.  \\nI have tenure in my position, as the workplace is unionized.  \\n\\n\\nHonestly no one really teaches you anything there, other than the bare minimum that requires you to do your job, and it's okay with them, since you're expected to escalate whenever you're stuck, or the issue is critical anyways.\\n\\n\\r  \\n**So overall, I'm currently overall simply a Tier 1 NOC, that isn't really gaining any new skillsets or connections, and is sort of stuck in a rather dead end, yet very comfortable position.**  \\n\\r  \\nA friend of mine who is working as a developer in a Startup Company, was trying to help me, and landed me an interview for the High-tech Startup company he's working in. However, he didn't have any real details as it's obviously not something he's involved with himself. My first interview was right away directly with my potential future boss, who asked me about what I do and what I know. Afterwards he described what he's looking for - A tier 2-3 sort of guy, that knows everything from Networking, Cloud, Virtualization, Windows Administration, Active directory and more. He called it an \\\"IT Specialist\\\" position. He said although there's a part time student that does Helpdesk work, as they are fairly a small team, such things would also be expected of me at times as well, though he was unclear, seemingly deliberately of how often this is going to be the case. Surprised by everything I hear, from the seemingly high ceiling of requirements, and with the odd combination of \\\"low-level\\\" helpdesk sort of work was really odd to me. I also admitted to him that from what he's describing, it doesn't like I'm what he's looking for, as I'm far less experienced as a T1 in some of these fields and have zero experience with most others.\\r  \\nRegardless of this interview, I seemed to continue on, having 3 or so more interview with various people, which sort of continued to rehash the seemingly high demands that I'm clearly not fit for, while having very basic questions (Such as, difference between TCP/UDP, reading the meaning of a presented rule from a FW, how would I troubleshoot X).  \\nAt that point, I was simply going through with the interviews, since they were all remote, short, and I wanted some experience with those type of interviews.  \\n\\n\\nTo my surprise, I got accepted, somehow. Most likely because my friend really vouched for me.  \\nThey offered me pay that is somewhat higher than my current one (Even if I do my weekends, and some night shifts), and a more structured schedule. The pay would be global, not hourly, and I'll work 9 to 18. There will be no remote work, and the commute will be somewhat longer.  \\nI don't live in the US or in Western Europe, so salaries are a bit lower here. For comparison's sake, I earn between 3,350 to 4200 dollars before tax, depending on the amount of hours, the amount of night shifts and weekends I did. While in the new job I'll learn almost consistently, roughly 4700.  \\n\\n\\nThe main issue is that, the position itself is very very vague. I tried asking the employer, many times what is it that I'm exactly going to do, but the answers where always \\\"Everything\\\", and \\\"Every day something different is required\\\". He throws around various topic such as Networking, and Cloud, but I couldn't get him to give me an examples, other than \\\"Setting up a VLAN for a new environment\\\".  \\nIt also seems quite clear, that at least a partial part of my work, though once again it's not clear how much of it, will also be some Helpdesk/Support.  \\n\\n\\nEverywhere I read, people say that although job titles are rather meaningless, in almost all cases, NOC positions are generally what people from IT move up from. So it feels like going in reverse.\\n\\n**I don't really know what to do, on one end, I'll increase my pay, I'll get to experience how it to work in a high-tech company, especially a Startup, I'll earn more money, and maybe even meet some talented people. And potentially I'll get to learn new things.**  \\n**On the other hand, I'm going into a place where I won't have a guarantee I won't get laid off, I'll have far more workload than I have now, I'll have no Night shifts and weekend work sure, but the longer working hours and commute will make so that i'll generally have less free time. And what's worse I don't even exactly know what my position is. I'm afraid that I'll end up being mostly a Helpdesk/support, and only occasionally, if I self-learn new things and \\\"prove myself\\\" I'll get to touch and experience more things.**  \\n\\n\\nI waited a few days and I need to make my decision 'today'. I'm so stressed of either making a mistake in moving, or refusing and actually losing an opportunity. \"", "title": "It Specialist, a Scam?

My original company was acquired by the new employer about 1 year ago. They've laid off most managers who initially challenged them but kept the actual workers. I've been put on a huge project that is replacing a major tool but the new management keeps changing their minds on expectations, dates, etc. They didn't listen to me or any other existing employee on their own side about the new tool they got despite saying they would include us in conversations. When I or other team members voice our concerns about limitations in the tool, upper management tells us to work around them even though they are very glaringly big limitations.  \\nThe reason they are pushing the tool is for the ability to apply it to future acquisitions and also to not have to pay as much as the existing tools.    \\nMy salary is about $142k and I am getting a 20% bonus (Roughly $171k overall) but the new employer refused to increase our base salary and just paid out our bonus this year. There is no indication on upward mobility or if we will see a raise next year. I'm also not sure if my job security here is greater than the term of the rollout of the current tool other than what feels like empty promises from upper management about \\\"needing us.\\\"  \\nI have a 4 month old and a wife that is not getting into the workplace for at least a year. So to say that I'm a little on edge here is a correct but the pay is really good and much needed.  \\n  \\n#Company B (soon to offer me)  \\nThe position would technically be a promotion to the next level up on a brand new security team. It is a much smaller financial institution with the goal of being a top brand in the region for what they do. This position is technically the 2nd on the team being hired after the director so my upward abilities could one day reach management pretty quickly if the team expands (which is what I want).  \\nThe job is not technically in what I do in security now and would have more to do with overall strategy and ensuring what we are doing is the best for the business which is certainly an interest of mine.  \\nThe recruiter has hit me with the salary range at $130k-$140k with a slightly less bonus at 15% (Roughly $162k overall at $140k base). That would be a roughly $9k pay decrease if I was at $140k.  \\n  \\n#Question  \\nSo my question is what do you guys think is the smarter move? Go with Company A or Company B?  \\nI'm trying to get the new company to come up on the pay a little (like $145k) to make it only a $3k hit but I'm not sure if I should get a little greedy and ask for $150k so I see an actual increase overall.

I wanted a gut check about how things are going in my company and wanted to know if planning to jump ship is a right course of action, but I wanted to wait until a full year (my full year with the company is in April) before I made a big decision. Below is a somewhat exhaustive list of things I've noticed since I was hired.  \\n\\n\\n* Originally, I was trained before my hire with the system administrator who was the help desk manager for the MSP team, he unfortunately passed away and I was hired immediately after with little to no practical IT experience, but substantial (6 years) customer service experience. Since then, the company has not hired someone else with equivalent experience to replace our late sysadmin, see below.\\n* Senior helpdesk technician whom I've worked with trained me as best as I could as I was onboarded during the busy season and was expected to be the replacement help desk manager. He just quit this weekend. Another person from the projects team was transferred to replace him, but is still primarily focusing on project work, it seems like a transfer to just have a body.\\n* My company has been in a long-term business relationship with our customer, who will be named **Major Customer**, this major customer was the primary money maker for our company where our focus is on. We sell them on the idea of primarily unlimited projects and it is obligated in the contract to have on-site support. I am the lucky soul who has to be at their office everyday for whatever IT problems they may face, regardless if it's something I have the knowledge of.\\n* Senior system administrator who is the SME for Windows and Microsoft was originally hired for implementations and bringing aboard new customers, but since his hire three years ago, our company has not seen a single new customer, and almost all of our operations have been focused on this one giant contract with **Major Customer**. He is actively seeking a new position and applying elsewhere.\\n* Learned a lot in this job, managed to get two major CompTIA certifications and have made a new inventory system, became in charge of all onboardings, and still providing basic troubleshooting of M365 products and break-fix to our customer on premises and currently trying my best to simplify onboarding processes and sysprep through learning Intune for Windows device and IBM MaaS 360 for Apple devices.\\n\\nRecently had a meeting with my Director of IT, told him about how I expressed interest in replacing the senior helpdesk technician and taking their remote position and returning back to my home state ASAP as well as currently being unhappy with the city I'm living in and had to move to for the job. In my company, I'm the only personnel who is required to be on-site, everyone else has a hybrid or fully remote position. Of course, I was never guaranteed anything, and I was told that my outlook for a system administrator position would be after two years (which is the conclusion of our current contract with Major Customer). I was simply told to keep improving my KPI's and to wait to expect new contracts, which my CIO and Director have been consistently hyping up, but so far there has been no news of new contracts. My company is very optimistic of growth, and they have just hired three new account representatives, instead of replacing or adding more personnel to the MSP team, which has been frustrating. Our CIO and Director of IT have most of their bandwidth focusing on the existing projects and only shown concern about tickets and KPIs following bounce back from corporate in the recent business review. Life currently has been primarily just all work, while juggling school and staying motivated through self-help books. I've really been wanting to study for my next set of certifications but it has been really difficult to stay motivated as of recently, and I'm continuously updating my resume and applying with no luck.  \\n\\n\\nTL;DR: First IT job and frustrated with the decisions of management, and wanted to know if this is normal for new MSPs and the best steps to take to get my next job (not planning on staying here for another two years to get a promotion and raise).  \\n\"", "title": "Need a gut-check at current job.", "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/1b6hphh/need_a_gutcheck_at_current_job/"}, {"author": "Cyber__Pleb", "created_utc": 1709574175.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 1, "post_id": "1b6h3jy", "score": 1, "subreddit": "ITCareerQuestions", "text": "\"Tldr: title, bachelor in IT vs Bachelor in Technology, software engineering.\\n\\n\\nHi everyone, I'm seeking some valuable advice and would appreciate your input.\\n\\nI've been offered admission to two part-time university programs and I'm having a tough time deciding between them.

They don't seem to have any trust in me, as they won't listen to what I have to say.\\n\\nI am only providing solutions this early in because my line manager is asking for them. For example, last week, they wanted me to automate some task and it required using a service account. They disagreed with using a service account because they thought it was insecure. They have no knowledge on this topic or working with this technology (used it before in previous jobs). So they asked ChatGPT to do it the way they wanted and ChatGPT told them what they wanted to hear. It lied to them. I tried to explain that ChatGPT was misleading with its suggestion, but they started to imply I'm resisting their instructions. So I was tasked to carry out an impossible task that was mechanically impossible. I tried to explain again, but they just kept implying I'm being difficult by not following their instructions.\\n\\nI proceeded to do the proof of concept to prove their way doesn't work. I got them on a call, explained why it won't work the proposed way, and they asked me again to complete the task, and that to call them later once I've completed it. Once again, they weren't listening to me. So for the next three hours of the day I was stressing about it. They had backed me into a corner as they weren't listening.\\n\\nSo I sent them a message about how I'm not resisting their instructions, and explained why it wouldn't work their way. Hopped into another call... showed them it wasn't possible and they then said we'll probably go with my original solution but they'll have to think about it.\\n\\nNow today, they are asking for final documentation for my proposed solution. I explained the documentation is incomplete because they haven't given me their decision. Then they immediately deflected and went onto some other issue I hadn't updated a ticket for as I'm actively working on it. I explain this. Then a couple of hours later, they ask for an update on the ticket. And again, for another update. I tell them I'm actively working on it. They've never explained to me what their expectation is.\\n\\nUsually, you work on an issue, provide notes on it once you've found the solution or what's blocking it from completion.\\n\\nSo yeah... there is clearly a misalignment of expectations between my line manager and I. I've tried to clear this up but they're making it very difficult to talk to them. And they always make out like I'm doing something wrong, when all the work I've done has been fine.\\n\\nI was hoping the trust would build up and they would ease off, but this strategy doesn't seem to be working.

I desperately need a change.\\n\\nNew role: Title is \\\"IT Director\\\" at a company with >400 employees. In reality, they are a company that has used a MSP for the vast majority of their existence and they're now wanting to begin creating an in-house IT department from the ground up. From my understanding, the MSP handles everything IT-related right now and they have no internal IT members. I'd be reporting to the VP of HR because they \\\"didn't really know where else to place IT under\\\" and she drew the short stick when she came onboard 3 years ago even though she admitted to knowing very little about IT. \\n\\nIf you haven't guessed already, the company sounds like a bit of a hot mess: they have admitted to failing IT security tests, don't use standardize software for some functions (Google Workspace for some vs O365 for others, Teams for some vs WhatsApp for others, etc.), I've heard they don't regularly update their computers, aren't aware of data compliance needs, etc. A 10-year company who grew incredibly quickly that has never had an IT department besides the occasional helpdesk-level hire and *might* have a shitty MSP.... You get the drift of the potential dumpster fire here. They talked about wanting to start peeling off services from the MSP in the future, hire some people, develop policies/procedures. They said they could see this role turning into a CTO/CIO a ways down the road once the team has been fully developed.\\n\\nThe pay increase would be substantial (+40-50% on base, into the six figures, no longer paycheck to paycheck for my family). The experience is down the route I want (want to head towards business/managerial vs technical) and seems like it could be a fast-track to a career in upper level management. Also worth mentioning I have a couple personal connections within the company that would give me a slight leg up on developing relationships. \\n\\nIn my mind: If I was able to actually have real carte blanche control (they said I would) and am able to lean on the MSP to continue to provide support as I develop an entire IT department, I feel like this experience could be huge for my career.
