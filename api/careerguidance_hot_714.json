This is the #1 reason why I'm trying to leave the trades. I hate simmering in my own sweat and grime for 8 hours a day. It makes me so uncomfortable in my own skin.\\n\\n\\\\-Strictly teaching jobs. From the research I've done, it seems like a large percentage of science jobs are teaching jobs. I'd be okay with teaching on the side, so long as I'm primarily doing research at a university, or some such scenario. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhat I do want out of a career:\\n\\n\\\\-Brain work as opposed to brawn work. As an electrician, you learn so many wonderful things in school, then apply maybe 15% of that in the field. Mostly, days are filled with putting up pipe, pulling wire, or installing plugs/lights/switches. I've grown tired of this routine. Occasionally, I've had service calls, where I go to a customer with a problem, and I need to use my brain to solve his/her problem. These service calls have been my most enjoyable experience in the trade, which leads me to the next point.\\n\\n\\\\-Interesting problems to solve. I don't care if I'm designing a spaceship or doing research in a lab. I just want problems that engage me, problems that further our collective human understanding or technological advancement.\\n\\n\\\\-High pay (who doesn't want this).

If anyone is working in a career that seems like it would be a match for me, I want to hear about it. Originally, I went back to school and picked physics on a whim, knowing it was generally what I wanted. I like the idea of being a research scientist. I also like the idea of being an aerospace engineer. I'm not that far into my schooling, so I can pivot in any direction. However, I need to be smart about this, which brings me to my next point.\\n\\n\\\\-Where is the demand? What industries need people, and will probably need people for the foreseeable future? Browsing on indeed, the physics jobs that I might be interested seem few and far between (within Canada). There's a handful of jobs for nuclear physicists, a handful for astronomers/planetary scientists, so on an so forth. All of these jobs require different qualifications and experience, which means that if I go down a certain path, I limit myself to a small pool of career opportunities. I should also mention that I am willing to work in the US or even Europe to chase demand, should the need arise, though I would prefer to remain in Canada if possible.\\n\\n\\\\-How useful is a PHD? I feel like I have a romanticized idea of becoming a doctor. Is it worth getting one for the purposes of finding work? \\n\\n\\\\-Is there any way I can leverage my trades background going forward? Would this be seen as a significant asset when looking for a job in the future? I have good tool skills, and have experience running jobs and managing workers.

I recently got into a good uni to study cs and economics with a scholarship  and at first my parents were worried about my future esp when it came to career opportunities and salaries. My family is full of doctors and dentists so they were bummed out knowing I wasn\\u2019t going to do medicine. When I started studying advanced bio, I realized I could not stand the lessons and I had a hard time bringing myself to revise for my bio exams. I would have to repeat the info a million times, write it down or actively recall. Despite that, I\\u2019d forget something I memorized really quickly. I realized that I wasn\\u2019t doing well with my subjects requiring memory. I still got good grades regardless but throughout high school, there hasn\\u2019t been anything I\\u2019ve been particularly interested in. I know people hate to hear this, but all I ever wanted was a good job paying me extremely well so that I could fulfill my wishes like having a good car, being able to afford a house, etc. I grew up in Dubai, but I was born in Pakistan. If I were to pursue medicine, I could only do that back in Pakistan where I would be all alone. It would be cheaper than the uni I got into though but Pakistan can be a scary and unsafe place as well. I know uni requires sacrifices but after losing a loved one in my family, I didn\\u2019t want to leave my family all behind while they all grew old. If I were to go to Pakistan, I\\u2019d spend 5 years studying medicine right after high school, and then I would have to prepare for the USMLE and apply for residency since my ultimate goal is to work in the US regardless of my profession especially since the rest of my family are all settled there except for my parents. I\\u2019ve been hearing a lot about how difficult it is for non US IMG\\u2019s to match to a residency and to be honest, I don\\u2019t even know if I\\u2019d be able to pass the USMLE because I think most of the Pakistani medical students are super bright and ambitious which is why I keep on seeing them post about how they passed the USMLE. I do think medicine is such a well respected field, you get to wear scrubs, wear a white coat, and enjoy the high salary of course if you\\u2019re an attending or board certified in the US. I know that if I do a non medicine job, I\\u2019d never be able to earn as much as a doctor nor would I have the same job security. But I\\u2019ve also heard scary things about the insane residency hours, and even there I\\u2019d have to be away from my parents being unsure about when I would be able to bond or spend time with them. I also don\\u2019t know how many years I\\u2019d have to sacrifice without a salary while preparing for residency applications. People say a job is a job at the end of the day, and you should treat it like that making medicine easily achievable as well?

This is a throwaway account.\\n\\n  \\nBasically, physics Ph.D. applications didn't go exactly as planned. I'll try to be vague, but I attend a public school ranked in the top 50 physics universities in the U.S., towards the upper end. I personally felt that I worked very hard in undergrad, I studied a lot and kept my GPA right around my goal of a 3.8, worked as an undergrad researcher since the beginning of my sophomore year which resulted in some presentations at my university, and spent two summers at a national lab where I was published in a sub-journal (if that's the right term) of a very well known journal, as well as some other miscellaneous conference papers/abstracts. My recommenders knew me well and were, as far as I know, very complimentary. I must note that I did not take the general or physics GRE. However, all that apparently was not enough. When applying to Ph.D.s, I reapplied to my home institution and the rest were applications to schools in the top 15 just hoping one would stick. I was accepted to my home institution, but rejected from all other schools. I was especially disappointed in a rejection from a public school in the top 10 for my chosen subfield, since I was able to tour a lab there and meet the current grad students. I don't want to make any excuses for myself, but I think I was just unaware how well qualified my competition was, and how hard it is to break into these schools when coming from outside the top 15. The smartest kid in my graduating class was rejected from most of the the top schools he applied to as well, and he is genuinely the smartest person I've ever met, even more so than the people I know who ended up going to top 10s for undergrad. All this is making me question what to do next. I'll try to say this without sounding arrogant, but I feel like a very well rounded person, in that I have many hobbies, friends, and things outside of physics that make me who I am, but all these rejections are for the first time in my life making me question how far I can make it. It's just weird as well since none of the individual rejections hit me hard, if it all, they were all just kind of like \\\"damn another one\\\", it's just the totality of them all is getting to me.\\n\\n  \\nThe thing is, I really don't NEED to go to a great school to get the jobs I want in industry or the government. As of now, I want to continue with physics research as a career, but I certainly don't want to work as a professor or somewhere that requires me going to a top 15 school. I think the thing is I'm very competitive and wanted to be among \\\"the best\\\" at what I do, and this process is making me feel as if I'm being told I'm not, and looking at these grad admissions forums and seeing other's results are certainly not helping.\\n\\n  \\nMy dream career is working as a physics or applied physics researcher in industry. But after this process, I'm questioning it. Doing research these past few years has taught me that most of the enjoyment I get from research is the actual process, i.e., the programming (especially ML), experimentation, etc., rather than the results at the end. Granted, my research has been in topics I'm not too into, but it has opened my eye to other career paths like data science, engineering, etc. Plus, I'm really not sure if I want to spend another 4+ years in my college town. I really want to enjoy my early-mid 20s, and I'm not sure how many opportunities I'll have to do that in my college town.\\n\\n  \\nThis is all to say, I'm basically at a crossroads here and am unsure of what to do. I'm definitely not going to wait a year and reapply with a GRE score, since I'm not sure that would change anything. I've decided I'm going to take the offer at my school, but I'm strongly considering mastering out. I just don't know how marketable my physics masters would be to physics adjacent jobs like the ones I've mentioned. I also could commit and see if I can just do my Ph.D. as fast as possible, maybe <5 years if I'm lucky. I think I'm just looking for guidance or seeing what other people have done in circumstances similar to mine. It's just a little dejecting when my friends are are getting into good masters programs, finding good jobs, and I feel as if I under-performed, even though I should probably be thankful I made it into a relatively high ranked Ph.D. program at all.

I\\u2019m facing the harsh reality that if I want to salvage my MSc in Finance, I likely have to endure another year of stress and financial strain (more loans). Not graduating until June 25\\u2019 at 25yrs old. But is it worth it? If I decide to stop pursuing my masters I could find any job that will take me, and hope for the best. But tbh, my confidence in securing a job that I actually want is dwindling, especially with my now shaky academic record if I don\\u2019t graduate. I\\u2019ve been applying for positions for probably 18 months, my original goal was to go straight into work, I only did the masters because i couldn\\u2019t find work after bachelors.  \\n\\nThen there\\u2019s the wildcard option: embracing life on the ocean. I\\u2019m drawn to the idea of working on a yacht, exploring the world, and reigniting my passion for life. I grew up on an island, I have lots of experience working charter crews and water sports. I\\u2019m pretty confident I\\u2019d find a nice job and I think it would benefit my mental and physical health.

I fear spending a year, or many, on the ocean would reduce my long term earnings potential. Short term earnings is comparable. But maybe I shouldn\\u2019t be so focused on the corporate life and should be more focused on doing what makes me excited about life and the money will come. \\n\\nSo, here I am, torn between three paths: (1) buckle down and repeat the year to get a Masters, and thus a solid corporate job by 25, (2) leave the masters and settle for any corporate job despite the lack of passion, or (3) take the plunge into yachting and see where the wind takes me. \\n\\nI\\u2019m open to any advice or insights you might have.\\nThanks for reading.\\n\\nTLDR: I'm a 24-year-old guy facing tough decisions.

I kind of lost hope in finding any career I really wanted and just starting applying for regular paid by the hour jobs like I did when I was a teenager as I'm thinking it's going to be too late for me now in my mid 20s.\\n\\nYea yea and I get it \\\"ohh it's never too late for you, you're still young many people haven't made until they're were around their late 30s\\\". Yea that's easy to say when the past few years all the desired opportunities and schemes have exclusively been for uni students only. Every time I find the perfect internship or work placement for me they only want a rising Junior or Senior Undergrad Student (18 years or older).\\n\\n* Must be actively enrolled in an accredited college or university degree program for the full duration of the internship (proof of enrolment required)\\n\\nI'm not the best at interviews and what I mean by that I'm not great at fake smiling or pretending to have a bubbly personality that girls usually have as that's all it takes it seems, as they really kind of care about specific diversity and inclusion only and not skill, talent or based on merit. A job interview doesn't tell you a single thing about anyone really and their protentional whether they got in or not. (My female cousins who are the dumbest fucking idiots you would ever meet all got successful careers at big companies already despite definitely not doing great in school and being younger than me. Their parents are loaded as fuck tho so I don't know if that played a factor into it? They grew up as spoiled brats who haven't struggled at all in anything, and thought it was normal getting luxuries like a \\u00a31500 jacket on a regular weekend as a teenager?) Anyway that's not really relevant and just me mini ranting.\\n\\nSo, I meet all the other skill requirements, past uni experience, actual competency and passion for the job yet I don't meet the required qualification of STUDENTS ONLY. So I obviously also looked for placements that were for post-graduates and there just weren't any I could find at the time and the very few ones I did, I didn't get in or a response for why with no actual reason, probably bc Linkedin says 900+ people have also applied for this as well. The 1 or 2 times I did get response it would be like \\\"you said everything right and what we wanted to hear on the application or interview but there were just others who had more years/months/days/hours/minutes of experience in whatever X, Y and Z bullshit, so we went with them\\\". HOW THE FUCK AM I TO GET EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY ONLY WANT HIRE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERINCE?!\\n\\nAnyway that brings me to now to my original question, you see a big company that I have been following for a while have now just released a bunch of graduate intern roles for people like me who have struggled. The issue is it's only for people who have graduated in the past 2 years,\\n\\n* You must be a recent university graduate, having graduated no earlier than July 2022.\\n\\nShit. I'm 2 years short to be allowed to apply for this. Can I lie about when I graduated on my CV and application? Will there really be any repercussions if I change my graduation date from 2020 to 2022? I really I want to apply for these and know I have great shot of getting in and want to be part of their Early Talent network of over 100 interns & apprentices, meaning I will have an important support network of other students, graduates and apprentices and plenty of opportunities to socialise! Do they actually check and verify your graduation dates? bc most employers I felt like they don't really check past job roles like I had a lot of part-time work when I was a student and I'm pretty sure they just took my word for it and didn't call whatever retail store/restaurant to see if I actually worked there.\\n\\nthanks,\\n\\nShakeel\"", "title": "Can I lie in on my application about when I attended university?", "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1bg4fpm/can_i_lie_in_on_my_application_about_when_i/"}, {"author": "USCTrojans780", "created_utc": 1710603502.0, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1bg8tum", "score": 1, "subreddit": null, "text": "\"Hi all.

I'm trying to pursue another career due to this one being soul draining and unfriendly, despite the great insurance and college fund program, but my ambitions are slim with the only driving one being monetary gain. I've been looking at radiology but I don't know what's right for me. I have interests in music, creativity and helping people out.\\n\\nTo begin, I never did well in high school at all. I nearly flunked out of every class, but somehow ended up doing well in my finals, graduating with (albeit disappointing) passing grades. I had mental health to blame back then though such as depression, undiagnosed ADHD (recently diagnosed) and low functioning autism. I desperately struggled due to not having a positive support system and my parents that didn't understand mental disorders. But now that I'm moved out of my parents house and engaged, with a few friends undergoing the same boat, I'm really reconsidering furthering my education.\\n\\nA problem with that though, is the fact that I don't really have too many interests in jobs, with my main driving factor being monetary value. I'm researching jobs that I could potentially get into, and so far radiolody technician seems to be winning. I'm mainly worried about the prereqs (that goes for nearly any career I consider), due to my past academic skills, or lack thereof.\\n\\nMy main skills are music; although not a master of it, with a few months of training on something I can become a pretty good player. I'm pretty creative, with a side hustle in creating dice for people locally. And I'm good at comforting people when they're feeling at their lowest. I've stopped a few people from hurting theirselves. But that's really all I have to offer.\\n\\nIt's really starting to get at me too, because my siblings have went to college, and I've been wanting to, but I'm holding myself back.

I came to law school because I had a pretty impractical undergraduate degree, I knew I had some skills needed for law school, and I was excited about the touted flexibility of a JD. My LSAT score outweighed a poor GPA and led to a full ride at a good school which solidified my decision to come. (Not a crazy prestigious school, big state school ranked in the top 25, but not in the state I want to work in).\\n\\nBut a semester and a half in, I\\u2019m starting to consider alternate career paths, as I\\u2019m not seeing much light at the end of this tunnel. Not sure if the two years of opportunity cost and cost of living loans are gonna be worth it.\\n\\n I don\\u2019t know my personality type but think it\\u2019s type B? I\\u2019ve never been concerned with getting rich, having some prestigious job, or even doing work that I\\u2019m passionate about (partially cause I don\\u2019t know if that exists). I just want to find a career that pays well enough to support myself and maybe a small family and has a good quality of life that allows for time off where you don\\u2019t always have to be stressed about doing work on vacation or making the time up when you get back. Pays well enough to me is hopefully cracking six figures within five or so years.\\n\\nSome options I\\u2019ve considered are moving back home to work and save on rent and trying to self-teach or bootcamp CS or programming (or maybe look into a degree), or maybe stick out law school and try to leverage the JD into Compliance or HR. I like to be creative and always learn new things and solve puzzles which makes programming intriguing to me, no STEM or CS background though. I\\u2019m also pretty good with communicating with different types of people which is why I\\u2019ve considered HR. I\\u2019ve even considered middle school and/or high-school teaching for the time off and cause I think I get along good pretty good with kids (always will be a kid at heart).\\n\\nIn law it seems like the only options are government, in-house, or making it solo. I\\u2019m not interested (nor probably qualified anyway) in being a fed, state gov seems okay for the wlb but not a lot of upward growth. And I think having to grind in a firm for the years it would take to land in-house or go solo would make me miserable.\\n\\nI\\u2019m 26 btw, worked a few customer service jobs before law school.

First time making a post like this! \\r  \\n\\r  \\nI have a huge dilemma that I am facing with a job offer I just received (I know, finally, yay!)\\r  \\n\\r  \\nThis is a two-part dilemma. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nPart One is the Offer.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI received an offer from a new company that is a 70% increase from my current salary. Early April start date. Completely on-site.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI have always been advised by everyone from my father to ex-colleagues to negotiate and counter the first offer, and have had success in doing so in the past, but I am weary to negotiate here since their initial offer completely blows my expectations out of the water. I am very satisfied with the offer, esp considering the increase was only base pay rather than full comp.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAside from potentially negotiating pay, in terms of the offer itself, I am ready to accept, sign, and bunker down til April. That really isn't the biggest problem, but this is a HUGE career move for me that requires context.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nHowever, Part Two is the **MAIN** issue. *This part affects my offer the most.*\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAbout a year ago, my best friend and I decided that it was time we started internationally traveling again (we are serial travelers - 5 continents & 20 countries together - and have not traveled since COVID happened 4 years ago). Long story short, we decided on a month-long backpacking trip through Asia starting in early May 2024. Considering the entire trip, we have deemed this a \\\"trip of a lifetime\\\"  bc ever since COVID began our lives have become very busy and we can't travel together nearly as much anymore. What comes next plays a part in that.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nA few weeks before the rounds of interviewing began and receiving this job offer, the same friend announced that she has decided to move from the mainland to the Mariana Islands and will relocate there right before our joint backpacking trip. She asked me if I could help her move (I don't think a pickup truck will help here - lol) as we've discussed visiting the Mariana Islands together quite a bit (a majority of her work is based out there and she flies there 2-3x/year). She has Diamond Medallion status with Delta and she offered to cover the cost of my flight to the Mariana Islands and to our first backpacking destination (her move feeds directly into our trip on the front end). She is using an 'upgrade certificate' so we fly on Delta One (lay flat seats) and have that experience together. Honestly pretty freaking gagged she offered that. I've seen the details of her new place and we are making a plan to move and pack her belongings in two different states.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nMoving forward, because we will be based 7,800 miles from one another and live on literal opposite sides of the planet, this is an event we won't necessarily have the privilege of having again soon (not really, but you get the point).\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI am really stressed about what to do - which I know in this case is a good problem to have.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nEssentially, I would begin working at this new company for a month before taking a month off. I definitely don't expect to use any sort of PTO (thinking unpaid leave makes the most sense) and I definitely expect some sort of pushback or suspicion. I have received the written offer letter, I just need to sign and put ink to paper. During the interview process, they never asked about prior commitments or if I had any prepaid vacations/trips planned, only the resignation notice period and when I could start. I went through 8 interviews for this job. EIGHT. And I passed.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAside from everything mentioned, in Feb 2023 the same friend and I had flights to Japan that I ultimately had to cancel due to COVID. Delta was running a killer \\\"unicorn\\\" Skymiles deal rountrip to Japan that we took advantage of, but was unable to rain check for when I got COVID a few days prior (Japan still required a negative COVID test upon entry at this time). HUGE bummer that I will NEVER forget. Considering this, I don't want to miss out on \\\\*another\\\\* trip that I will cherish for the rest of my life.\\r  \\n\\r\\r  \\n**Main questions:**\\r  \\n**1**. Do I sign the offer letter and then tell my new employer about my upcoming commitments or do I NOT sign the offer and inform them first and maybe negotiate a start date in June? The former is better for me personally, but worse for the optics of the situation, and may incentivize the company to rescind the offer. \\r  \\n\\r  \\n**2**. Would you personally negotiate higher on the offer knowing it completely exceeds anything you could've imagined countering with? Do you think accepting their initial offer will in fact make me look bad or inexperienced in their eyes? There are so many realities with countering that it's hard to put a proven framework to it - it's always very situational.\\r  \\n\\r  \\n**3.** Instead of countering for traditional items such as compensation, I am thinking I might want to negotiate my start date to begin after I return (early June 2024). However, I feel that's the most unrealistic considering we are in mid-March, but starting for a month and leaving for a month also seems pretty unrealistic. \\r  \\n\\r  \\n\\rI'm really nervous to sign the offer letter AND THEN inform them of my plans, but it's really only between me, my direct boss, and HR at that point as with most other situations. They're very team-oriented, so I believe I should be fine as long as I'm transparent with them and prioritize goals and projects before I leave to help 'lessen any delays or damages' from my absence.\\r  \\n \\r  \\n\\r  \\nAny advice is helpful - thank you!!!\\r  \\n\\r  \\n\"", "title": "Dream career?

For example, one of my direct supervisors has gotten 2 master's and 1 bachelor's through my job (the guy has 5 total degrees, dudes crazy).\\n\\nSo, with that being said, here is my dilemma. My job is very supportive with continuing education but STRONGLY prefers certain universities (if you can make a strong enough argument, they will pay for a non-preferred university), however, I would prefer other universities. The reason I would like to attend another university is because I am looking to make the move to the UK in a few years and they have a visa called the High Potential Individual Visa (HPIV) which can be a way of easing a company in the UK's decision to hire someone who needs a skilled workers visa. \\n\\nSo, my background, I already have a master's degree (Physics), but it is not within the field of work I am in (AI/ML and Computer Science) and does not classify for my desired route to the UK. \\n\\nHere are my arguments so far:\\n\\n1. The 3 schools I am looking for are all online programs (minus a 2-3 week on campus capstone project, but I can work remotely at my work for these weeks). An online masters means that I can complete all my schooling post work hours.\\n2. The 3 schools are highly respected universities (Harvard, UPenn, John Hopkins)\\n3. I have already signed on to work 3 years (sign-on bonus agreement) and would need to work the required time ask of me to pay the company off for paying for the degree (they do not take any of my wages, they just ask you to work 3x the time it takes to finish your degree, so 1 year masters = work for 3 years, and yes if I work during the masters that counts for the first year)\\n4. This is a personal one, I do not have kids and my partner is planning on doing the same thing with her company, so I will be able to fully commit to school and work at the same time.\\n5. No matter what, I would have to be accepted by the university on my own regardless of if it was on the preferred or not list (duh).\\n\\nSo, should I see if I can convince my work to let me do a master's from my desired list or should I just accept going to the preferred list.

A 1 would indicate you do not meet expectations, while a 4 would indicate that you exceed them.

This felt totally antithetical to the rest of the review.

This was my first job out of school and I\\u2019ve worked my way to the role I am now. I was making ~62k a year until this past week and was able to get a raise to 75k. I absolutely love the company I work for and my colleagues/ superiors are all very supportive of me. I also don\\u2019t have to worry that I will get fired out of the blue with no warning. I get unlimited PTO (to the extent that I can take multiple 4 day weekends in a row with no questions asked) and am very lucky to not feel micromanaged or scrutinized to death.

I have connections in the industry and ideas that I was planning on pitching, however, I have hesitations in offering that up after this past week. \\n\\nIn the last month  we\\u2019ve started a pretty substantial transition and recently hired a someone in Business Development. She has no prior experience in the industry and I often times have to correct her multiple times/ reiterate the same information multiple times. She spends most of her day taking clients out for drinks (and possibly sleeping with the boss). I recently found out she is making significantly more than I am which is frustrating given that I know the amount of work she actually puts in versus spending the day drinking and eating on the companies dollar. I could probably do all of what she does in a matter of a couple of hours. She takes credit for other people\\u2019s work and is probably the most out of touch individual I\\u2019ve ever met. This past week, I was approached by a client of ours that wanted to \\u201cpoach\\u201d me from my current company. Within a day or two, I was approached by a recruiter and  was able to get on a phone call to discuss this opportunity further. Come to find out, not only would it be feasible for me to be making 100-110k a year (with 20% bonus) but it\\u2019s for a company I work with on a daily basis and I have contacts with locally that are willing to put in the recommendation for this position.

I'm recognized as a \\\"core mentor\\\" by my company, someone we recognize as a manager that will help develop you as well as anyone in the company. \\n\\nMy issue, is that my next step isn't clearly defined. I most likely wouldn't get my managers role (SVP) when he is promoted as I lack certain knowledge that is needed, and there are better candidates. My strengths fill out my manager's team perfectly, but they're ultimately less valuable than the specific financial knowledge he has. Slightly more valuable than the technical expertise I bring, which he does have a background in, I'm just primarily focusing on that in my role. The top individuals I know that would most likely get it, and want it, are all great peers, and they lack what knowledge I have, but again, lack of financial management hurts me. \\n\\nI'm being asked to step into a compliance VP role, which I'm more than qualified for. What I don't know in the role I will learn in the first 3-6 months, which the SVP there is more than comfortable with as they desperately want my expertise in the regulations that team deals with. (The knowledge there is valuable across my company, but this team directly oversees that content, and I have been essentially acting as a liaison for the group for about 5 years since they lost a lot of their leadership.) And they need a recognized leader willing to step in and commit long term.\\n\\nIf I stay in my role, I can start to carve out more time to focus on growing what I don't know and filling the gaps. I have done a bit in previous years, I can advise on strengths and weaknesses in budgets and our financial reports, but I've never managed a business line directly, and I have not had a lot of opportunity to dedicate time to learning previously; but I can make a point moving forward as I'm currently growing my team (6 >10 direct reports) \\n\\nI've also been offered a $15k raise, and the opportunity to be groomed for the SVP role in the compliance team when that individual retires in 2-3 years, which would most likely result in at least $170k salary, 50% bonus, and increased stock plan. \\n\\nI'm a few years shy of 40, just completed MBA, and absolutely love what I do. I know I would like the job if I take it, and it gives me a legitimate shot at attainable executive status in my career, as well as further experience to list on the resume... but I would be stepping away from a lot of success, a lot of involvement in large scale projects that will benefit my company moving forward and improve our competitive advantages, and vacate my role as content expert for a number of lines of business. \\n\\nHard to imagine turning down a shot at a potential path to executive, but here I am twisting over it. \\n\\nWhat would you do? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"", "title": "Unsure if I should take a lateral move to open a new, almost guaranteed path to promotion, but in less interesting group? \n", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1bf3i9u/unsure_if_i_should_take_a_lateral_move_to_open_a/"}, {"author": "ramenlover_4life", "created_utc": 1710482943.0, "num_comments": 2, "post_id": "1bf77ty", "score": 1, "subreddit": null, "text": "\"I always see that there\\u2019s career pathway programs for people in health care.

I\\u2019ve since transferred roles (they were careful never to use \\u201cpromotion\\u201d during the whole process) to something more internal focused. When they told me about the role and that they had me in mind, I was excited and reaffirmed my interest.\\n\\nI knew that moving out of a commissioned role would change my potential earnings. I was, and still am, fine with that. The hiring process for this newly created position was laid out to me - they were going to post the job publicly and hire as normal (ie go through screenings, interviews, etc.) and that I should apply there. I wouldn\\u2019t be screened, but I could expect an interview.\\n\\nI was happy with that process, because it gave a formal time and environment to learn more about what they had in mind and, most importantly, how it was going to pay.\\n\\nThey post the job, I apply, they did some preliminary interviews but never called me in. They told me they decided to cut the middleman and just give me the position if I was still interested. I was caught off guard but said yes, because I was excited and achieved a career goal. \\n\\nI didn\\u2019t ask about pay because I was excited and I feel awkward asking (I know I have to get over that). My thinking was that it would be made apparent in the offer letter that was coming next week.\\n\\nBut a week went by, and no offer letter. It was stuck in HR. Another week goes by, then a month - no letter, no discussion.

The other recruiters I worked with would ask me what was the hold up with certain things and I had to continue to let know that this recruiter had not gotten back to me on what I needed.\\n\\nThe same recruiter told me that I had to reach out to IT helpdesk to download a certain font to be able to write in salary details and candidate address details, which made no sense at all so I spent about 2 days going in circles, trying to get this resolved just to speak with one of the other recruiters from offshore who said that I didn\\u2019t have to do that at all and fixed the issue in less than 5 minutes\\u2026\\n\\nThe same recruiter when I asked her about gathering salary information for a certain level candidate, she said \\u201cAmericans don\\u2019t give a salary\\u201d and left it at that. I followed up and let her know. This was supposed to be market data which can easily be found by doing research, not based on the demographics of a person.\\n\\nThere was also a higher up talent acquisition manager that started a day after me, and I would notice how she yelled at members from the offshore team and was very rude in her responses to all of us. I would reiterate what she would say during calls and ask her to clarify via email so that I have it as documentation. She did not like that at all\\n\\nAfter a few months, she said she didn\\u2019t have the time to give to me so she was switching me to another manager.\\n\\n Things were going good with this manager but he seems to be just as confused as me on new processes, and situations that arise within the company\\n\\nA few weeks ago my new manager asked for my LinkedIn login credentials so that he could access the recruiter license, and I let him know that I was unable to do that due to it, being a breach of LinkedIn\\u2019s contract, and would risk my profile being restricted, and or losing access\\n\\nFast-forward to a few days ago another offshore team member asked me for my login credentials and I let her know that she could not have the login details to my personal account, and that I had had issues with a previous off-shore team, wanting to access my account in the past which caused the review by LinkedIn for a violation of sharing the LinkedIn license she then proceeded to say that \\u201cwe should all support each other as team members, especially since they are extending their support to US hiring\\u201d\\n\\n\\nI stood firm in my decision and did not give her my information. She told me I could double check with our LinkedIn point of contact to see whether there was going to be an issue but she had already checked with them and they said it wouldn\\u2019t be so I followed up with the LinkedIn point of contact sure enough, they said that it was an issue, and that the license would need to be reassigned which, by the way, there is already one recruiter off shore, who has a LinkedIn license assigned to them\\n\\nThen when working on onboarding a candidate yesterday which there was an issue with a start date for a candidate last week someone from the talent operations team emailed on a thread with the entire talent operations team that I made a mistake in a previous offer so they wanted to double check that the new candidate that I am onboarding information would be correct due this current candidate was joining for a similar role to the previous with the mistake in the year of joining. (The current candidate joining is in fact, not joining for the same position and a lower level position )This seemed to be a negative response from me not providing my login details to my LinkedIn the previous day\\n\\nSome of the worst things that happened is remember how I said that the talent acquisition manager joined a day after me and my company has this thing where they wish everyone a happy one year anniversary or whichever year that you are on that. That manager received a happy anniversary email with the team chiming in. I did not receive one at all the day before\\n\\nI waited all day, hoping someone would say something even my current manager who is off-shore as well.

I was previosuly working for 9K and the new postion offered a salary of 11.5k with a potential $1500 extra per month if you meet your KPI. Secondly, this was a permanent positon (after a 6 month probation period) whereas I was previously on a 2 year contract. Thirdly, there are more opportunites for professional growth at my new job. My previous company was a lot smaller and basically apart from the general manager there were only 2 other senior postions. There were also some organizational issue at my previous company, mainly the lack of stock. Most request we responded to came with a minimum of 6-8 weeks delivery time which discouraged many customers. There were issues with delivering items by they're promised delivery date, which lead to coming up with a lot of creative ways to tell customer their goods just weren't here yet.\\n4. Why am I second guessing this new career shift?  \\nI've been in this new position for exactly 1 month now which I know is not a long time and realistically I may need to be here a bit longer before I pass judgement.  But what I've seen in the past month has not been promising. The work environment is very toxic. There's a lot of inter department issues and passing blame. Employees are very disgruntled and it has nothing to do with money which is usally the case. For those who work a regular 8am to 5 pm shift I've noticed it is the norm to come into work early and leave late with no over time compensation. I usually get to work at 7am which I have no problem with but idealy I would like to leave at 5.  \\nA major goal for the company right now is to basicaly redesign an entirely new maintenance plan since the previous plan has not been working. The major issue that I have is that there seems to be no linear plan in how they want to provide me with training so that I can assist in this goal. I fully understand that they can't spoon feed me everything and I will have to do a lot of self learning but there seems to be no directive. The work load seems to be too much for just myself and the one other maintenance planner who is also fairly new to the role as she was previously working in the finance department for the last 10 years. \\n5. Should I return to my previous job?  \\nWhen I handed in my two weeks notice at my previous job I was made a counter offer to stay. All it really amounted to was an increase in salary from 9k to 13.5K which is actually more than I'm currently making. However, it would have still been a contracted position not a permanent positon. Many people who I spoke to urged me to take the new job offer stating the obvious facts that there was room for growth at this new company, it is a larger more stable company and it offers a different level of experience. Even my former co-worker told me to leave and take the new opportunity.\\u00a0  \\nThe one factor that I've felt that I've over looked is the work life balance. I'm by no means an extermely social butterfly but I do have a things I want to be able to prioritize in my life right now and I was afforded a very solid work like balance at my previous job whereas here it seems like there is no regard for this. My old company still has my position open and did say if I changed my mind I could come back, but the position won;t remain open forever. \\n\\nWhat this all boils down to is whether I should stay to furhter my career or simply go where the money is better?\\n\\nAny advice really would be appreciated because I've gotten all sorts of opinions from outside sources.  \"", "title": "I'm having second thoughts about a new job I recently started, how do I begin to navigate the change?

I worked there for two years at the surgery center got burnt out because of leadership and surgeons. As I was leaving one of my old coworkers from the hospital that now works at the VA told me that a VA position was opening that paid way more and had better benefits. As we all know, the VA takes forever to apply. Being in a small town in Montana, my only options were the surgery center that I just left, the hospital which didn\\u2019t have any openings or the VA. So due to having stress levels that were high, I took a break from the medical field and worked at a grocery store. While I was working at the grocery store, I was still waiting for the VA to post a job opening. I\\u2019ve been in contact with the medical field manager that I want to be in. We have exchanged emails so I know it was a legit position that was going to open. Since the grocery store wasn\\u2019t paying enough, I was falling behind on bills.

I messaged my old boss, the manager, and within three days got hired and got a lead position now here\\u2019s the crazy part. my friend that left the hospital to go to the VA told me that the VA would have a job opening by the end of March and the VA manager confirmed that too.

Plus this way I can get more experience before I apply to the VA hopefully get more money. So I accepted the hospital position yesterday and of course, as of this morning, my friend from the VA and manager posted the job for the VA and it went live.

I am 23 years old and I recently graduated college with a bachelor's degree. I currently work as a bartender for a restaurant and was given an amazing opportunity by my boss to be a co-owner for a new restaurant that he is opening. My parents helped me money wise and gave me a good deal of money to invest in this endeavor. They are also part of this investment and they were hoping that this was something that can help them retire a little bit early.

I will be put in charge of this team in 3 months. I've been a part of several large-scale software and new product implementations at our org, and have led numerous cross-functional teams to deliver projects across a variety of scopes. I also have significant non-business leadership experience prior to coming to this company out of college, and I have effectively been leading the ERP team for 2+ years now. I have built a fairly wide sphere of influence at the company over the past 6 years, and have solid rapport with my IC colleagues, and both middle and upper management, particularly our CEO and my boss who is a director.\\n\\n**The current scenario:** \\n\\nWe, like many companies, are investigating AI and how it can impact our organization. We've formed a small investigative team consisting of our CEO, my boss, the IT manager, a Network Infrastructure Engineer, and myself. Since I have a passion for technology, and have been in the loop with AI for several years now, I'm quite a bit ahead of my colleagues when it comes to this technology. The CEO has asked me to lead the charge for AI investigation and implementation. He and I have had prior conversations, and I've been up front with him that I'm interested in some day moving to executive leadership. He is currently mentoring me, and has advised that he's looking for me to fill a hole in the next few years for our IT leadership, tantamount to that of a CTO. Because of our relationship, he and I have had several past discussions about how we can use technology, and more recently AI, at our company.\\n\\n**What I'm seeking advice on:** \\n\\n* What are your thoughts/experiencing on leading a team in a setting where I'm 'out ranked' by pretty much everyone on the team. It's a weird position where I'm being given control over the trajectory, but at the same time, don't have a ton of decision making capability. I have PM experience and have delivered projects before at this company, but it's always been in a cross-functional setting with my peers. So, mostly 'horizontal' teams, but this project team is 'vertical' with top leadership being involved all the way down the hierarchy.\\n* My boss and I have a great relationship, and I don't want her to feel threatened. I really value her experience, leadership, and thoughts/ideas, so I don't want to alienate her. At the same time, I have a vision for where I see AI at our company, and I am confident in that vision. She knows I have a good relationship with our CEO and several other members of staff, and while she doesn't outwardly reflect negativity towards that, I can tell at times she's wary of those relationships. Any advice on how to navigate this is much appreciated.\\n* I've identified several large gaps in our infrastructure, data management, and talent that likely needs to be built up if we're going to be successful in deploying and maintaining AI initiatives. In other words, our company, especially from an IT infrastructure standpoint really lags behind, almost to an archaic level. I won't go into a ton of detail since it's not necessarily relevant, but I've been open about the challenges we're facing from an IT perspective with my boss and the CEO - they've both agreed that these are valid and should be tackled, but ultimately these challenges are just a few out of many across the organization. In other words, how do I keep the challenges I've identified visible so that I can get the resources needed to address them. Unfortunately, there isn't an easy button to pull us up to where I think we need to be. Especially since I'm not really in IT, rather, IT-adjacent, it's a complicated dynamic where I have to lean super hard into influencing others in a sphere of expertise they aren't super experienced with. \\n* I've started with building up a foundational knowledge base so the team will at least have the fundamentals, and we're attending a few seminars this month, but where to go from there? I'm ready to move forward in my mind, but there's still a significant gap between where I'm at and where everyone else is. We don't have any relevant talent internally who can scale AI applications, and with the current team, we can't really pull someone off to work on this, let alone learn the data or computer science required to truly realize some of the potential with AI. I've made some suggestions for what sort of talent we'd be looking for, but we're not ready for that yet, and since budgets have been tight this year, we'd already be looking into next year to consider building a relevant talent pool (aka budgets are locked in now). Is there any way to build up this 'capability' in a way that may or may not be intuitive, but will help us be more successful?\\n* I completely get that changes like this don't happen over night, and even more so, that despite my head start I have when it comes to AI, that I can't do this alone. I want this team to succeed, and I have a vision for where I want us to be. I feel like I'm being encouraged to do so, but at the same time I feel a bit like I'm wandering in the woods. There's a lot of work ahead of us, and this is hardly our sole focus strategically, nor is it my (or the individuals on the team) sole focus from a project standpoint. How do I navigate the team dynamics, as well as ensure we get the resources necessary to be successful. Especially since we're all a bit tepid and unsure about how much to commit to something fairly unknown, esoteric, and poorly understood by most in the enterprise.\\n\\nThanks much!\"", "title": "Seeking advice for leadership approaches in a complex and vague setting (at least for me) - how do you advise I navigate this?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1bf2dhb/seeking_advice_for_leadership_approaches_in_a/"}, {"author": "True_Sherbet1671", "created_utc": 1710466909.0, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1bf2ckc", "score": 1, "subreddit": null, "text": "\"I am a somewhat recent graduate of architecture school (2 years out) and I recently moved and took a new job that is in an adjacent field to architecture (but not really building \\u201cdesign\\u201d) because I wanted to try something new and see if that was a path I wanted to go down.

Again I don't mind traveling, I thought it was going to be like a week per month or something. I really like my job too... I just feel like it's a lot of travel for 50-75% of my personal life. I'm trying to find a house, plan a wedding, help my mom etc. I told my manager my concerns and i said 2-3 weeks of travel EACH MONTH shocked me and is a big shift. They also want me to support a few other programs and idk how the expect me to be gone 75% of my life then the other 25% help these programs too. he understood but basically said that he had to do that when he was in my role at one point. They also said due to staffing issues they can't find anyone local. They had someone local working on these projects. But they changed roles and now also they also have travel to another state. It doesn't make sense to me as to why they had the local person transfer roles, having me take their place, have to find someone else take on my program, and all while the 3 of us have to relearn everything and at least 2 of us travel. and i literally got an email saying that travel should be for emergencies only. And my personal life will be impacted. I just feel like I'm stuck doing this and I'm not happy about it but idk how to express this more than I already have without looking bad. I have a meeting with both the guy I'm working with and my manager next week and I'm not sure if I should just tell them I can travel 1 week/mo and occasionally 2 weeks? Idk how to say it. The travel part is honestly more up to the guy I'm working with rather than my manager. Any advice is appreciated \"", "title": "My job wants me to travel 2-3 weeks a month for a new project.

I moved up the ranks and our CIO retired last year and we got a new IT manager who is a huge asshole. He ended up firing me for no reason in the begining of October and blocked my severance. I had a very hard time finding an IT job due to not many places hiring. I eventually found a contract IT job at the end of November for a Doctors office chain but it was awful, they didn't follow any IT guidelines or procedures and were literally buying computers at Best Buy and trying to domain join them. On top of that they were having me drive all over the place to deliver keyboards and mice to doctors or nurses, I was averaging 110 miles a day on top of my commute to their main office. I only lasted a month. I got a call from another company I interviewed with and they came in with a strong offer. Downside was it's 42 miles away and no chance to work from home.  Upside was extremely good benefits including a pension and better pay.\\n\\nI've been in this job since late December and so far it's not bad they have good modern technology and I've learned a few things. The downside is they just opened this location so there's not many people in and I've been extremely bored. I have a long commute just to sit in an office and do almost nothing all day then have to take a long commute home in heavy traffic. Tuesday of this week I legit got nothing sent my way and no one came up to me for help. I felt like it was such a huge waste of my time. Other weirdness with this company is the IT departments don't get along and there's these weird wars between them like I found a network issue and tried to help fix it and was told by my boss not to because the network team never helps us when we need it so why should we help them... I ignored him and did it anyway and got it resolved he ended up thanking me later on. Other things I've done to keep busy is move office equipment like cube dividers around and rearrange boxes in our storage room. I'm kinda grasping at straws to keep busy. My boss said they can be flexible if I let them know a head of time if I do need to WFH but it can't be a regular thing. I don't see it ever being permanent which is a shame. They have a ton of WFH employees but apparently IT can't be one of them.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and her parents think I'm crazy and keep telling me it will get better once they start hiring more people and that I should just enjoy the down time. Plus my gf keeps saying they are paying me to do nothing so it's a win win.\\n\\nI'm just having a hard time not doing anything all day and commuting so far. I feel like I could be getting stuff done in between work if I was WFH still. I've been toying with getting back in the job market but I feel weird trying to look for another job so soon especially since this job as such good benefits.\\n\\nWhat are people's thoughts on this? Should I stick it out?\\n\\nTLDR: got a new job in late December, has really good benefits and a pension but office just opened up and I'm sitting around all day with nothing to do and it's 42 miles away so it's a long commute.

I chose this major because everyone told me it fit me the best and gave me the best opportunities, and I listened without thinking for myself. Unfortunately, this is common for me, as I've always been compared to my sister it was always established that I'd end up in a STEM career and be as successful as she is. But, during the transition between my first and second quarter, I was left alone for two weeks and as I worked on a project to add to my resume I found myself wondering why I chose the major, which eventually led to me realizing that I didn't enjoy anything I had done in the past three years. After realizing that this would be what I would essentially be doing for the remainder of my life, I started thinking back and realized that I hated this major, that I was essentially only doing for the money.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the only things I seem to enjoy are writing, reading, and music, things that aren't really a good way to make a future unless I get extremely lucky in some form. I've met with my career advisor a few times, and we established that English, with a concentration in technical writing, would be a good major for me, and it would at most take me an extra year to graduate, meaning that my scholarship would still cover it for me. \\n\\nStill, I'm a bit confused as to what this would mean for my future, as STEM has always been my path in life, it feels a bit odd knowing that I'd be going for something that is basically a passion with a wide field and no real path to it. I understand that I'm young, but the fear of me wasting even more of my future is still there, even though my friends, and most of my family support me in this.

I really do love writing stories, drawing, and building characters' arcs. That's why I started an animation YouTube channel in high school, back then it was doing pretty well.  \\nThe thing about me is that I hail from a developing country, and I've always been closely tied within the American sphere of influence. So my early endeavors with my YouTube channel allowed me to have comfortable purchasing power here. My parents never married, and I live with my grandma. So since high school, I've been economically alone. My YouTube channel stopped being profitable and I've come to hate animation, mostly due to the work-life balance brought in by the low earnings I was getting.  \\nI'm studying Computer Science, and while I find it interesting, I really wonder if it's ultimately worth it because of AI. I really dislike AI when it's used as output, and it breaks my heart to hear my professors talk about AI all the time. Frankly, I don't find it interesting as it takes away the power humans have. And it's just kind of boring in the long run.  \\nAnyways, my father's side of the family is full of doctors, and they frankly live really well. I know Medicine is a tough career and not immediately profitable. But as I've grown a bit older, I've come to realize that sitting alone on a computer isn't very fulfilling. Interacting with people and helping them is something I've come to really appreciate. And while Medicine may be hard, I can at least count on it having the ability to get me a job for sure.  \\nNow, the reason I've chosen CS is that there will be a higher potential for profitability. With me being able to essentially make \\\"American-money\\\" in a low cost of living country. There are plenty of expats in my city, and frankly, they live the dream. Medicine doesn't seem too profitable comparatively speaking within western countries. I think I read that my dad was making 1700 USD a month from Medicine. And while that may not be impressive in the US, that's triple the GDP per capita here. And speaking from experience, the cost of living here is equivalent to three times less than in the US. As a doctor, I could always specialize in a field and ultimately make good money. I'd like to point out that money shouldn't be the only factor when deciding a career, but I think Medicine as a whole is really interesting too. I really have to worry about money as I've been living in poverty for the last 3 years since finishing high school. I couldn't afford to go to college, and right now I'm in my second semester of CS. Still unable to pay for my college, but I've taken on some debt to cover the cost. I really want to give myself, my grandma, and my dogs a higher quality of life. And I'm willing to do whatever is necessary for all of us to be happy. Money doesn't make people happy, of course.

I have a little over 2 years of experience and think that this company is the perfect place to stay for a long period (lots of opportunities to grow), yet a colleague gets on my nerves so much that I'm contemplating leaving.  \\nI sit in a room with 4 other colleagues (including the reason of my issues) everyday for 8 hours.

I think it's safe to say that Mike is on the spectrum; he has never stated anything so I don't want to state anything specific but it's obvious. Mike kind of fits in the company, makes jokes and knows how to take them. The issue lies with his personality, he's much rather lazy than tired. He never picks up any work and prefers to be on his phone instead. Clients of ours have stated that he seems lazy and is always doing something unrelated to work.  \\nI've talked to both my manager and director about him multiple times and they, unsurprisingly, agree with me; changes have to be made. They promised to talk to him and try, which they did. Unfortunately nothing actually changed. They specifically told me to let them handle it; which makes sense since it's not my job. 1 day after their talk with Mike he reverted back to his lazy self.  \\nAlso every time he speaks I automatically get stressed out by his whiny voice (which obviously he can't control). I've never had this much stress in my life and this doesn't even seem to be to be worth stressing over, but I just can't seem to ignore him.

But, the salary was less than spectacular and I wasn't willing to give up my freedom yet to a 9-5, especially while I was still kind of living the college life until May. So, instead I turned down the offer, continued my part-time hours, and also picked up another similar internship a city over. I work 30-40 hrs a week between these jobs, and expected once it was time to move out of my college house, I would just pick one. But now, it's getting a lot harder and I genuinely don't know what to choose.\\n\\n  \\nAlso: I work with software, not a developer but closely alongside developers, more in the planning/design process of a product than the actual creation.  \\n\\n\\n**My main problem**\\n\\nJob #1 offered me an initial salary of 60k, which was significantly less than the average for someone in my program to make out of college (about 85k). Now, they're coming back around a few months later and offering me 70k. It's still not phenomenal, but it's not bad. Also, they REALLY want to keep me. I wouldn't be surprised if I can bump them up closer to 75k.\\n\\n  \\nBut now, I'm kind of set on job #2. I'm ready to move cities, and generally just enjoy the culture and environment of this job better. HOWEVER, company #2 is on a hiring freeze. They can't hire me on full time, and I'm capped out at what an intern can make, which is the equivalent to about 55k a year. \\n\\nIF they were to hire me on full-time, I know for certain that the starting salary is 85-90k. I don't know when this freeze will end. They have assured me that the plan before the hiring freeze was to have my position full-time, but the hiring freeze is a bigger company decision than just our tiny office.\\n\\nThe truth is, money wasn't really a consideration until a job my partner was shooting for fell through. Now I'm kind of getting a reality hit - it's HARD to find jobs in tech right now. I only got both of these positions because of my school's career fair, any attempt to explore outside of these two cities has been radio silence. \\n\\nSo, big question: **Am I an idiot if I turn down a salaried position in a place they really need me, for one that I like the environment at a little more?** I have no college debt, and both cities are rather inexpensive. I think my main gripe is that I'm over being a struggling college student. I was ready not to have to worry about money, but even if I cover rent while my partner works a random service job to fulfill his other expenses, I feel like we end up back in the same financial boat we've been in for years.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nOther background info because I needed to write this out for myself anyway:\\n\\n**Job 1**  \\n*Pros:*  \\n\\\\- Worked here for over a year now  \\n\\\\- Fast-paced, constantly new tasks, always something to do  \\n\\\\- Late start-up environment, only about 75 employees \\n\\n\\\\- That 70k salary offer\\n\\n\\\\- I would feel bad if I left\\n\\n\\\\- This decision would be a lot easier if I hated this job, but I don't. I enjoy the work I do, I don't have a problem with anyone I work with, and I would even say I'm able to be more self-propelled in what I do here than at job #2. \\n\\n  \\n*Cons:*  \\n\\\\- I talk to NO in-office developers. They are all offshore, and frankly don't give a hoot about the product. Every product that's come back to me has been buggy, unwieldy, and full of friction. They don't have any interest in building a design system to help maintain fidelity between products, or hell, even just in one product. Anyway, end rant. \\n\\n  \\n\\\\- \\\"Strict\\\" remote policy, only three days out of the month. As someone who's parents live far away, being able to work remotely during holidays and breaks has been kind of a necessity, which is part of why I stayed on part time, because they can't make me come into office. Despite this, they DO have full-time remote workers to fill positions that they can't find talent for in my city. But if you live in town, only 3 days of remote for you.\\n\\n\\\\- I'm certainly not super close to anyone. The only other person with my title is fully remote, and frankly isn't really interested in teaching, mentoring, or guiding me in anyway. \\n\\n\\\\- I really, really don't plan on staying long-term in this city. Also, I've already been here for four years, I'm over it.  \\n\\n\\n**Job 2**\\n\\n*Pros:*\\n\\n\\\\- In a new city. Not necessarily better, but new and a little closer to my parents.\\n\\n\\\\- I am a lot closer to people in this office. Many of them are closer to my age range, and those on the younger side are good friends - in bands together, go on weekend trips together, have game nights, etc. As someone who is going to lose basically all of their college friends once everyone moves away, this is kind of a big deal. \\n\\n\\\\- This job is paying for me to go to The Conference for my profession this summer in SF. I've never even been to Cali before, so this is also a super exciting prospect.\\n\\n\\\\- Affordable housing is within walking distance of my office.\\n\\n\\\\- The other employee with my job title that's above me is very passionate about what he does, hard-working, and views himself as a mentor.\\n\\n\\\\- Very flexible remote schedule. Most people CHOOSE to be in office, which I feel like kind of speaks for the environment that there is.   \\n\\n\\n*Cons:*  \\nThe only con is the pay. \"", "title": "Am I going to regret turning down a salaried position that pays 15k more for an internship-level position I enjoy more?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1becsre/am_i_going_to_regret_turning_down_a_salaried/"}, {"author": "CuriousFrontierman", "created_utc": 1710390325.0, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1becone", "score": 1, "subreddit": null, "text": "\"So I\\u2019m about to graduate with a business degree and I have not found anything I would like to commit to that I am able to do.

It doesn't seem so dismal that I couldn't stick it out for a year or two, but I'm trying to gauge what costs/risks I should consider before making the decision. Here are the things I'm thinking:\\n\\nPros - \\n\\n* Breath of fresh air, new environment (MUCH NEEDED)\\n* Possible growth opportunities and valuable experience\\n* Completely remote \\n\\nCons - \\n\\n* Possibly jumping from one dumpster fire to another\\n* Less security; smaller company, somewhat iffy finances (positive shareholder equity, but not profitable currently)\\n* If I leave before logging a few years, might hurt my chances at getting another offer?\\n\\nIf I wasn't so desperate to leave my current company I would likely hold out. But even the thought of putting in my notice has been making me salivate the last two days. What do you think? Would I be taking a huge risk? If I do it, should I plan to commit at least 2 years regardless of how it plays out? Should I enter a mode of slow but consistent job hunting to find the dream role? Or is job hopping right now too risky to take an offer I'm not confident in?

Graduated with my BHS from a decent university recently. Background is 8 years military healthcare, field medicine, orthopedics, leadership, and fitness. 2 years various orthopedic technician positions and medical assistant positions. 2 years orthopedic instructor/sales experience. \\n\\nThis job market is crazy. \\nIt\\u2019s been months. Applying is my second job. I paid for a professional resume, linked in, I tailor my cover letters and tweak the resume slightly for individual jobs and follow up with calls. \\n\\u201cHave you tried..\\u201d Yes. \\nEverything that my vast experience could be even slightly applicable to, I\\u2019ve tried. I\\u2019m just looking 70k a year in a high cost of living city so I can move my kids to a better district in a few years. People describe me as charming, extroverted, analytical, inspiring, attractive, and \\u2018manly\\u2019. I have a preference for working with my hands and in roles where I help people. I guess I\\u2019m looking for stability and financial freedom.\\n\\nI got a few prospects and a few paths in front of me. \\n\\n1. Anesthesia machine repair tech and sales for vets. 80k a year. 100k next year. And It would give me the sales experience I need to transition into Ortho sales in a few years and really make some money. There are a lot of cons to this though however. I\\u2019d basically be gone 6 months out of the year and to me that\\u2019s not worth it. My family does need me. And I do need them. Even if years down the line I was making 300k working 90 hour weeks doing ortho sales, I don\\u2019t think I would ever be happy knowing I miss my kids growing up. \\n\\n2. Clinic coordinator for a nursing college. They conveniently offer a program where I can get my BSN online and it pays 55-68k. Work life balance is acceptable. Getting my BSN and rn would be interesting. I would continue on to either pursue and msn or np. Aesthetics pays a lot. I\\u2019m at home in healthcare. I work great with women and I love serving my community and the patients I get to interact with make my days better. I\\u2019ve always thought about plastics too. And my OR experience would come in handy for future jobs. Also always employment opportunities, but I would never be a hospital/icu nurse. \\n\\n3. Trades. I don\\u2019t have a preference. People say plumbing is amazing for pay. I\\u2019m a veteran so I could probably find a place to pay me 50k while I train. I say that because I know that for a fact. But it doesn\\u2019t have to be plumbing. Though I like talking and interacting with people so I don\\u2019t want to do anything too deep in the shadows. I could get the family involved down the road but this path really makes me being the first person in my family to get a degree thing not really sit well in my brain. Unless it would be good for a lateral move into a high paying career down the road?\\n\\n4. Sonagraphy? OT? Other graduate programs that aren\\u2019t MHA? I think I\\u2019d perform very well in sales or any role where my enfj personality can shine. I\\u2019ve considered joining the FBI as well, but I don\\u2019t think I can pass the credit checks.

I'm mid-level in my career, and have historically been pretty career driven. I am mid/late 30s, but completed a career change about 8 years ago, which has made me feel that I am behind where I \\\"should\\\" be in my career at this point.\\n\\nI have wanted a promotion for a while now, and have put in the work to go above and beyond to gain a promotion over the last year / year and a half. I finally was promoted in late Nov (2023). However, I'm considering stepping back into my old role at this point for a number of reasons, outline below:\\n\\n- PAY -- I would actually get a (albeit small) pay *bump* if I were to step back. I was slightly above the mid point of my old pay grade, but am at the low point of my new pay grade, so only got a 2.25% pay increase with this promotion (even though it jumped me two salary grades). The company has a new comp philosophy that did not allow for any negotiation. This was already a raw deal from my perspective, but the real kicker / cherry on top is that this promotion actually meant that I wasn't eligible for a 4.5% company-wide comp adjustment that everyone else got on Jan 1 (because my promotion took effect in Q4, and promotions in Q4 were decided to be ineligible for the comp adjustment). *And even though* my manager told my I would get the comp adjustment when she made me the offer and I was trying to negotiate my salary (unsuccessfully due to the stringent new comp philosophy, where every position had a pre-approved hiring start rate that was non-negotiable). She didn't know at the time that I would be ineligible for the comp adjustment (I truly believe that is true), but nonetheless, she did tell me I would get it, and I didn't. So at the end of the day, if I demoted myself, I would step back into a rate that would actually be 2.25% *above* my current pay. (I've already confirmed that they would honor the 4.5% adjustment in my old role still.) Though it's not a big increase we're  talking about here, the entire situation just really, really rankles me....\\n\\n\\n- SCHEDULE -- I'm in a supervisory role now, which means coming into the office 3 days/week instead of 2 days/week. My company recently implemented this increased RTO in Feb this year, up from 1 day/week previously. For me, this is a huge downside. I have come to very, *very* highly value work-from-home, and the shift from one day in office to three these past 6 weeks has been r-o-u-g-h. My only hesitation with this as a considering factor in whether or not to step back is that I do not believe the 2 days/week for non-supervisory roles is going to last. I believe that once they've figured out the space constraints issues of being in office, everyone will be back in 3 days/week. I just don't know when that would happen.... Could be a couple months, could be till the end of the year. Who knows. If it were till the end of the year, that might give me enough time to find another job that hopefully would be remote (I'm looking, but the market is trash right now).\\n\\n\\n- MANAGER -- My current manager is one of the biggest reasons I'm unhappy. She didn't used to be as bad as she is now, but in the last 1.5 / 2 years, it's gotten really bad. We have a new CHRO, and I think our old CHRO kept a level of humanity to the overall culture thats since been lost. With my manager, especially lately, I feel like my opinion/thoughts never matter, it causes great anxiety to ever request any time off or schedule adjustments (I'm salaried, but even asking to leave an hour or two early for a doctor's appointment feels like pulling teeth), she is always argumentative and always has to be \\\"right\\\", never let's you have a dissenting opinion or different idea, has no respect foryour time (example: I had a meeting a few weeks back that was supposed to be an hour with her; she was 25 min late, then kept me on with her for 2.5 hours after she joined; yes youbread that right, two and a half hours). She frequently has emotional outbursts, talks trash about everyone (including us, her own direct reports, to each other), and has made myriad off-color comments related to team members' pregnancies and leaves of absence. One of our team members has actually just raised a formal complaint against her to our CHRO and CEO. If I were to demote myself, she would no longer be my direct manager. Awkwardly, one of my (new) coworkers (who is currently a level below me) would take my place. I don't have a good sense for what he'd be like as a supervisor because he's pretty new still, but I have to think he'd be better than it is now. I also think I've developed a pretty good relationship with him thus far, and think he'd be generally more chill, but I don't really know.\\n\\n\\nThese are the main reasons I want to step back. The reasons I want to stay are:\\n\\n- TITLE -- The title for my resume. As I've said, I already feel behind in my career, and I worked hard for this promotion. () I had hoped I could take this title and leverage it into another job, which I'm still trying to do but the market is suuuper crap right now. \\n\\n\\n- THE JOB -- The job has issues and isn't still as autonomous as I'd like it to be, but it at least has *some* level of discretionary decision making to it, which I've been wanting more of for years. I usually take pride in being an excellent employee and doing good work, and kind of get excited at some of the work opportunities that come with this role (though in all honestly, I've had a really hard time motivating lately, especially with the extra-crappy promotion that decreased my pay and put me in the office *more*....so tbf I'm not producing work to the level I usually do.....).\\n\\n\\n- MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CO-SUPERVISOR -- I have a direct counterpart who was also promoted to the supervisory role at the same time (these are two new positions that were just created), and I feel like we've trauma-bonded these last few months because of our manager, lol. It would suck to have to change our dynamic because it's one of my only silver linings to this job lately.\\n\\n\\nWHAT WOULD YOU DO???\"", "title": "Should I demote myself?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1be9z7g/should_i_demote_myself/"}, {"author": "SeriouslyCrafty", "created_utc": 1710382141.0, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1be9xyl", "score": 1, "subreddit": null, "text": "\"\\nI have a client that I do a small amount of consulting for on a bar program at a big hotel.

Pay rise was +$2.50/hr. Am I being ripped off?**\\n\\nHello fellow professionals (wow I feel I can finally call myself that). I would really love some advice.Some backstory:\\n\\nI started working in a warehouse for a major textiles distribution company in 2022. I began as a pick packer, and within 2 years have worked my way up through the ranks, being offered the role of BI Analyst a few months ago. I have always been interested and curious in the ICT space and actively demonstrated my interest in the field to my employers over the last few years. I routinely went above and beyond what was required of me within my previous roles in order to gain a foot in the door in this aspect of the company. I learned what I could from the resources the company offered, and put in extra unpaid hours after work learning the inner workings of our companies preferred software, and built visual reports in Power BI (I was not asked to do this). Some of my analyses and reporting ideas were adopted by the company and are now used to streamline our or operational processes. This is a multi-million dollar company with 200-500 employees in my country.\\n\\n2 months ago the current business analyst announced they would be taking leave for 9 months. They are the only business analyst employed by the company who is based in Australia for our particular sector of the company. I was approached and offered the role in their stead, before the company looked for an external hire. I'm thrilled at the idea, and have been working hard and training for the last 2 months in this new role before they depart. I absolutely love it and am learning so much. There is a lot of value that I believe I can bring to the company in improving their processes and operational insights.\\n\\nWorthy to note here: I do not have any prior experience in this field, nor do I hold any qualification in this industry. My boss has for the last few weeks I've felt, been avoiding the conversation of my changing employment contract and wage. They finally agreed to sit down with me last week. They have not offered me a new employment contract to sign, but did offer an adjustment to my wage.\\n\\nCurrent Role: Warehouse Floor Supervisor  @ $30/hr\\n\\nNew Role: BI Analyst and Developer @ $32.50/hr\\n\\nI was a little shocked. This is a very important role within this company. If key reports were to go down or needed amendment, there isn't really anybody else who could make the necessary changes, and our daily operations all but rely on them to maintain our current operational performance. I understand that I do not have prior experience in this role, but i've demonstrated my skills and capabilities, they were noticed, and I was offered the role. I understand that this is a tremendous opportunity for me, and that I should be grateful for this position. Believe me when I say that I am, and work hard to prove my worth everyday I'm at work.\\n\\nIs this a reasonable wage for the work that I wil be doing in this role, or am I being seriously undercut here? Do I have room to negotiate? This is my first break into the professional white collar industry and I already feel I might be being taken for a ride...

My job is to stress test the ideas engineers come up with, analyse the cost and returns to understand whether this passes the go/no go stage, pitch for funding, develop sales and marketing material and once it\\u2019s ready for sale, hand it over to the sales team to sell. \\n\\nThis was a good first time role for me because I thought I could use it to slowly understand the engineering knowledge and I quite liked the idea of testing ideas and routing them to market. \\n\\nI always want to get into sales, and I have dreams of being high in the corporate ladder and making a name for myself. I have been networking with colleagues around the business. Just for reference this is a global business and one of the leaders in the energy industry. \\n\\nFrom one of my networking calls, a guy who manages a sales team in a different division really liked me and said I should go for a role he has in his team. I voiced my concerns on not being technical enough but he said we just want someone with the entrepreneurial spirit. I was really exited, but out of courtesy I had a chat with my manager to tell him I was going to have a chat about this role, and his response was (not in a rude way at all): \\u201cDo you feel confident to sit in front of a customer and talk technical, because at times you will and you won\\u2019t always have your product expert with you\\u201d. This comment pulled me back into my self doubt because I agree, I don\\u2019t know everything from an engineering point. There\\u2019s still more to learn.\\n\\nFrom this I had a call with the sales guy hiring and said pretty much thank you but I\\u2019m not ready. He responded back saying things to reassure me that I should interview because there will never be a right time. Once this role goes, they rotate in three years. So if you\\u2019re ready in six months, I won\\u2019t be able to do anything. He did nearly sway me but I stuck to the plan after talking to my manager.\\n\\nI have frequent networking calls and I had a chat with someone who previously was in my team and made a big jump. Explained the situation and he was on the same page of just go for it. You\\u2019re never 100% ready and if you wait till you are it\\u2019ll never happen. This annoyed me and I feel I missed an opportunity. After the call ended, a few minutes later he messaged me saying \\u201cI\\u2019m really close with the (name of the guy in sales). I asked him and there\\u2019s still an opportunity open, he said to email him). \\n\\nI\\u2019m so nervous right now because I don\\u2019t want to look like an idiot. For reference I have been in this full time role since March 2023. My manager said I don\\u2019t want to ruin my CV by job hoping around. If I got this role I would be there for 3 + years then start looking for opportunities to manager a small team and go from there and work bigger.\\n\\nTLDR: Should I apply/ potentially accept a role I\\u2019m not 100% ready for. I have the entrepreneurial drive, I just don\\u2019t know all of the technical stuff. \\n\\nSorry for the long message and any comments would be very much appreciated. I understand I could interview and not get the role. Im scared on understanding what to do if successful as I think I\\u2019ve pretty much got it ass it\\u2019s a sales role that has been open for a long time and they haven\\u2019t filled it. \\nI did ask why they haven\\u2019t filled it and because it requires relocating up to Scotland, people don\\u2019t want to do it.

I originally majored in Psychology but quickly got bored so I added Criminal Justice because this field has always been interesting to me.

Although I am still young, this is a non-negotiable aspect of my future and I know that for a fact. I have wanted to be a mom forever, and I don't want my children being raised by other people because I am at work all of the time.  \\n\\n\\nMy parents didn't go to college, I am actually the first person in my family to go to college let alone graduate school.

I got this and my Bachelors degree in cooperation with a Fortune500 company in the IT field which is possible through a program here in Germany. Therefore I worked for the Fortune500 company for 5 years already, the first 3 only in different projects for a few months to discover the company and the last 2 years I've been working in one departement. I think I do a pretty good job there, as I am well known and respected as a couple of colleagues forgot I was only working part-time (Masters degree), I get quite a lot of responsibility compared to others in the program and I already got an offer without me asking for that same role to become a full-time employee after Masters is finished.

I wouldn't call them a startup as they're not developing something new but they are 5 people of which I know 4 fairly well (they are 10-15 years older).
