Many companies are hesitant or unable to sponsor visas due to the complexity and cost involved. This can significantly reduce the pool of opportunities available to international candidates, making it even more challenging to secure a callback.\\n\\n**Fixes:**\\n\\n* To make sure you're qualified, you should be checking off at least 60% of the requirements of the role.\\n* If you're qualified, there's a good chance it's your resume. Most people's resumes contain mistakes that fall into one of three categories: improper formatting for ATS, generic content, or not enough personalization/customization. I provide more info about each of these in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/tq061t/biggest_mistakes_that_impact_your_resumes/) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/s2b37q/if_youre_applying_online_use_a_single_column/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1).\\n* For international students and new grads, do your research and target companies and roles that have historically sponsored visas or are known to be more open to international candidates can improve your chances. Additionally, being upfront about your need for sponsorship can help set the right expectations from the start.\\n\\n# Second pain point - not making it past the recruiter screen\\n\\nIf you're getting calls from recruiters, but aren't making any progress after that, then there's something going on with what you're telling (or not telling) them.\\n\\n**Some Potential Causes and Fixes - Recruiter Screen**\\n\\n|Possible Cause|Fix|\\n|:-|:-|\\n|Your elevator pitch is unsatisfactory|Practice your pitch and ensure it aligns with what the company is looking for in this particular role. Your pitch should essentially answer these questions: Who are you and why do you want this job?|\\n|What you're saying doesn't match what's on the resume|Memorize your resume and everything on it, including titles, dates, and responsibilities.|\\n|You're asking for too much money (if you've revealed your salary expectations).|Don't reveal your salary expectations at this stage. If asked, just say that you'd like to learn more about this position before you can provide a realistic salary expectation. Do your homework on salary range for your position, industry, and company.|\\n|You're not prepared, haven't done your research, don't seem enthused for the role etc.|There are a lot of other applicants. If you don't seem like you want the job, they'll move on. To prevent this: research the role/company and develop a good understanding of what they do (i.e., their market, products, services etc.). Look at company pages, read their mission statement, read the job description, show up on time, and try to sound neutral at the very least (excited would be good).|\\n\\n*Note: These are just common causes that may be behind your results. This isn't an exhaustive list and there could be other reasons not covered here.*\\n\\n# Third pain point- you're not moving forward during interviews with hiring managers\\n\\nGetting roadblocked during the interview stage likely means you're not performing well enough.\\n\\n**Common Causes and Fixes - Interview**\\n\\n|Possible Cause|Fix|\\n|:-|:-|\\n|You're not sufficiently answering behavioural interview questions|Practice! There are a lot of good guides all over the internet on this topic. See a brief guide to these questions below this table.|\\n|You can't remember important details about past projects and accomplishments|Prepare a master list of projects and accomplishments you've been involved in throughout your career. Follow the STAR format. Memorize it.|\\n|You're lacking key skills and experiences.|If you know you lack key skills/experiences, you'll need to provide a very good rationale for why you'd still be the right candidate for the position. If you don't have one, you probably shouldn't apply.|\\n\\n*Note: These are just common causes that may be behind your results. This isn't an exhaustive list and there could be other reasons not covered here.*\\n\\n# A note about behavioural interview questions\\n\\nEmployers love using behavioural questions because they give them a little bit of insight into how you'd behave in a particular role, how you'd react in a particular scenario, or how you'd solve a particular problem or task. They're also really hard to fake.\\n\\nA few common ones you've probably heard before:\\n\\n* \\u201cTell me about a time when...\\u201d\\n* \\\"How would you approach X problem...\\\"\\n* \\\"Imagine you're in the following situation...\\\"\\n\\nAnswering these questions is beyond the scope of this post today, but if you're struggling with these types of questions, you'll need to prepare and practice in order to respond effectively.\\n\\n# A note about the STAR Method\\n\\nYou've probably heard of this before, but for those of you that haven't, the STAR method is a simple and easy-to-remember technique for answering behavioural interview questions. STAR stands for:\\n\\n1. Situation: Describe a specific situation or event where you faced a challenge or had to solve a problem. Try to pick a relevant example that shows your skills and abilities.\\n2. Task: Explain the task or responsibility you had in that situation. What were you supposed to accomplish or what goal were you trying to achieve?\\n3. Action: Talk about the actions you took to address the situation or complete the task. Explain the steps you took and the skills you used to resolve the issue or meet the goal.\\n4. Result: Share the results of your actions, focusing on the positive outcomes and what you learned from the experience. This could include how you improved a process, solved a problem, or achieved a goal.\\n\\n# Hopefully these tips help you!\\n\\nThis isn't a comprehensive guide by any means, but it can hopefully give you some ideas and point you in the right direction if your job search isn't getting you the results you want.\\n\\nGood luck!\\n\\nPS: If you found this post helpful, consider subscribing to my free newsletter, [The Launchpad](https://thecareerlaunchpad.beehiiv.com/subscribe), where you\\u2019ll get weekly tips to help you network, find jobs, and make more money (not to mention the the freebies). \"", "title": "Troubleshooting your job search (when it's not working)", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/128xo1c/troubleshooting_your_job_search_when_its_not/"}, {"author": "FinalDraftResumes", "created_utc": 1680424179.0, "link_flair_template_id": "4aa409a6-ba0e-11ec-99a8-fa1ad6799306", "link_flair_text": "Mod Announcement ", "num_comments": 3, "post_id": "129ez4n", "score": 200, "subreddit": "resumes", "text": "\"Hi r/resumes \\ud83d\\udc4b\\n\\nAs a member of the mod team, part of my job is to make it as easy possible for you to access the resources available here.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a lot of guidance in the wiki, but since many folks seem to miss it (especially new users), I\\u2019ve created a list of answers to common questions and issues. \\n\\nPlease familiarize yourself with these resources before commenting or posting. \\n\\n**\\u201cI was banned for no reason...\\u201d**\\n\\nPlease read the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/index/rules/) to avoid a ban.

I graduate with a B.Sc in Computer Science in December and since then have been working as an intern at a company. While the internship is going decent so far, I feel it's best that I attempt to job hop. \\n\\nFirstly, I don't like the fact that I'm still having to work as an intern even after graduation. Back in 2023, I applied to almost 1000 positions but only got one callback which was for an intern position. Despite already being graduated, I told them that I was still in school and took the position; any position is better than none, right? \\n\\nUp until now, my responsibility has been to overhaul one of their web apps. It's been a great learning experience, but as that project comes to a close, they're wanting me to move on to working with building controls and automation (working with Niagara), and I'm not certain yet if I want my career to go in this direction.\\n\\nOne of the things to really turn me off from this company is that despite signing an offer letter to receive $19 / hour plus a $250 / week stipend, HR took away the stipend after I'd been working here for less than a month. Their reasoning on paper makes sense; they hired me to work hybrid but I've been working almost exclusively remotely; but surely they already knew I'd be working remotely, right? \\n\\nAnyways, I digress.

While this background isn't strictly resume information, it's useful as framing for any advice y'all may have.Thanks for your time, and Happy Sunday!\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nJohn Doe\\n\\nemail address   |   ###-###-####   |   LinkedIn profile\\n\\n**Experience**\\n\\n**Consultant**   xxxxx   |   Jan. 2004 - Present\\n\\n* Offer an ever-expanding buffet of creative and technical services to clients as my skillset grows via professional development.\\n\\n*Current project: Video production and editing in Kdenlive for client's planned YouTube launch, slated for this year.*\\n\\n**Support Services Analyst**   xxxxx   |   June 2018 - Jan. 2020   |   xxxxx, Texas\\n\\n* Placed ads in InDesign for the 54 internal sites that were not automated.\\n* Automated placement via JavaScript, saving 80 hours a week on team of 3 and eliminating errors.\\n* Crafted additional layout scripts for other departments, often realizing efficiencies north of 95%.\\n\\n**Commercial Team Lead**   xxxxx   |   June 2016 - June 2018   |   xxxxx, Texas\\n\\n* Oversaw production team of 7 designing features and other sections at 4 external client sites.\\n* Communicated with editors to avoid surprises hitting the press.\\n* Worked with internal and client IT to set client up with CMS ingestion, then manually edited malformed XMLs when they errored out in production.\\n* Spearheaded automation using JavaScript and formulas in Google Sheets, saving 60-plus hours weekly across data reporting, client data ingestion and internal/client notifications.\\n\\n**Project Manager**   xxxxx   |   Jan. 2016 - June 2016   |   xxxxx, Texas\\n\\n* Developed a highly scalable non-CMS workflow for $500K client in three weeks while assisting other departments during ramp-up.\\n* Worked with internal departments to assess client service needs ahead of launching the company\\u2019s first commercial services.\\n\\n**Content Production Specialist**   xxxxx   |   June 2015 - Dec. 2015   |   xxxxx, Texas\\n\\n* Coordinated with offsite editors to design pages in a frenetic multi-deadline environment catering to a network of more than 200 properties.\\n\\n**Technical Development Specialist**   xxxxx  |   Dec. 2012 - Sept. 2013   |   xxxxx, Ore.\\n\\n* Developed and implemented VB.NET application to streamline audio auditing processes, resulting in more than 80 hours per week in efficiency gains for a 10-member team.\\n* Examined XML and HTML files embedded in ePub containers to add audio adhering to 3.0 spec.\\n\\n**Marketing Communications Specialist**   xxxxx   |   Nov. 2011 - Oct. 2012   |   xxxxx, Ore.\\n\\n* Developed distinctive brand persona for Wolferman's, upheld established voice for Cushman's.\\n* Generated product names and composed descriptive content for both print and online platforms.\\n* Produced compelling copy for channels including landing pages and B2B/B2C emails.\\n\\n**Page Designer/Editor**   xxxxx   |   June 2010 - Nov. 2011   |   xxxxx, Ore.\\n\\n* Edited stories, display copy while laying out pages on tight deadlines.\\n* Created easy-to-understand data visualizations for print and online.\\n* Collaborated on a reader-engagement project to improve community calendar listings, doubling the information we were able to provide with fewer resources.\\n\\n**News Editor**   xxxxx   |   Aug, 2003 - May 2010   |   xxxxx, Ore.\\n\\n* Worked with a very talented team put together by a new editor to turn Oregon's smallest daily newspaper into a publication that won General Excellence the second year.\\n* Collaborated with editor on a complete reimagining of the print product, including nameplate, full redesign, the addition of standalone features sections and far more community involvement, replacing syndicated content with local content in most cases\\n* Coordinated with reporters and stringers as assigning editor to ensure the Tidings was covering the most relevant stories for the widest audience.\\n* Oversaw daily print production in addition to assigning and line-editing stories and serving as editorial page editor, giving content a final read and laying out pages.\\n* Received national and state recognition for writing, design and data visualizations, taking first place for best graphics even when combined with the next circulation class, midsize dailies.\\n\\n**Skills**\\n\\n* JavaScript\\n* HTML/CSS\\n* Office, GSuite\\n* Creative Suite\\n* Linux\\n* AP Style\\n\\n**Education**\\n\\n**Tech Talent South**  \\nMay-July 2021  \\nonline  \\nFull-Stack Java Certificate\\n\\n**University of Xxxxxxxx**  \\nJune 1997-Dec. 2000  \\nCity, ST  \\nCS, Linguistics  \\nNo journalism program; left early to get into a newsroom \"", "title": "Just redid my resume again after years of >99% rejections and would appreciate feedback.

I haven't been successful in finding any jobs or internships schemes, despite my best efforts in looking and applying everywhere. I kind of lost hope in finding any career I really wanted and just starting applying for regular paid by the hour jobs like I did when I was a teenager as I'm thinking it's going to be too late for me now in my mid 20s.\\n\\nYea yea and I get it \\\"ohh it's never too late for you, you're still young many people haven't made until they're were around their late 30s\\\". Yea that's easy to say when the past few years all the desired opportunities and schemes have exclusively been for uni students only. Every time I find the perfect internship or work placement for me they only want a rising Junior or Senior Undergrad Student (18 years or older).\\n\\nMust be actively enrolled in an accredited college or university degree program for the full duration of the internship (proof of enrolment required)\\n\\nI'm not the best at interviews and what I mean by that I'm not great at fake smiling or pretending to have a bubbly personality that girls usually have as that's all it takes it seems, as they really kind of care about specific diversity and inclusion only and not skill, talent or based on merit. A job interview doesn't tell you a single thing about anyone really and their protentional whether they got in or not. (My female cousins who are the dumbest fucking idiots you would ever meet all got successful careers at big companies already despite definitely not doing great in school and being younger than me. Their parents are loaded as fuck tho so I don't know if that played a factor into it? They grew up as spoiled brats who haven't struggled at all in anything, and thought it was normal getting luxuries like a \\u00a31500 jacket on a regular weekend as a teenager?) Anyway that's not really relevant and just me mini ranting.\\n\\nSo, I meet all the other skill requirements, past uni experience, actual competency and passion for the job yet I don't meet the required qualification of STUDENTS ONLY. So I obviously also looked for placements that were for post-graduates and there just weren't any I could find at the time and the very few ones I did, I didn't get in or a response for why with no actual reason, probably bc Linkedin says 900+ people have also applied for this as well. The 1 or 2 times I did get response it would be like \\\"you said everything right and what we wanted to hear on the application or interview but there were just others who had more years/months/days/hours/minutes of experience in whatever X, Y and Z bullshit, so we went with them\\\". HOW THE FUCK AM I TO GET EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY ONLY WANT HIRE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERINCE?!\\n\\nAnyway that brings me to now to my original question, you see a big company that I have been following for a while have now just released a bunch of graduate intern roles for people like me who have struggled. The issue is it's only for people who have graduated in the past 2 years,\\n\\nYou must be a recent university graduate, having graduated no earlier than July 2022.\\n\\nShit. I'm 2 years short to be allowed to apply for this. Can I lie about when I graduated on my CV and application? Will there really be any repercussions if I change my graduation date from 2020 to 2022? I really I want to apply for these and know I have great shot of getting in and want to be part of their Early Talent network of over 100 interns & apprentices, meaning I will have an important support network of other students, graduates and apprentices and plenty of opportunities to socialise! Do they actually check and verify your graduation dates? bc most employers I felt like they don't really check past job roles like I had a lot of part-time work when I was a student and I'm pretty sure they just took my word for it and didn't call whatever retail store/restaurant to see if I actually worked there.\\n\\nthanks,\\n\\nShakeel\"", "title": "Can I lie in on my application about when I attended university?", "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1bg4ha4/can_i_lie_in_on_my_application_about_when_i/"}, {"author": "Mari2130", "created_utc": 1710546100.0, "link_flair_template_id": "c292b8e0-28b9-11ec-874c-325b17e851a3", "link_flair_text": "Review my resume \u2022 I'm in North America", "num_comments": 9, "post_id": "1bfs2p4", "score": 3, "subreddit": "resumes", "text": "\"\"", "title": "Could someone help review my resume?

I changed my major and path a few years ago, and I made a huge mistake in that I needed to invest in myself, and instead, I put more emphasis on academic aspects. Now, I know a little about a lot of things, and I'm an expert on nothing. My tech-related experiences and projects are just junk.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDespite applying for various entry-level positions\\u2014from front-end and web design to UX researcher, product designer, and software engineering\\u2014 and getting a few calls, I'm stuck on optimizing my resume. I put two versions, one for UX researcher and another for web dev/designer. I would appreciate your feedback and recommendations.

Post-graduation, I took some time off to travel before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. In 2020, I chose to prioritize taking care of my elderly parents, which led me to step away from the workforce for a while.\\n\\nDuring this period, I decided to pivot my career towards user experience research. Throughout 2021, I dedicated myself to self-education, enrolling in online courses covering user experience research, user experience design, and human-computer interaction.\\n\\nMy efforts paid off when I secured a contract opportunity in October 2022. Since then, I've been engaged in several contract positions, building my skills and gaining practical experience in the field.\\n\\nHowever, I'm grappling with whether or not to address the gap in my resume from early 2020 to October 2022. On one hand, I understand the importance of transparency and honesty in presenting my professional journey. On the other hand, I worry that such a lengthy gap may raise red flags for potential employers, suggesting a lack of motivation or dedication.\\n\\nI've done some research on this topic, and opinions seem to vary.

The vast amount of rejection emails made me feel like I wasn't worthy of a good job and was honestly considering making a career switch.

In case this will help anyone else, here are a few things that I changed/did:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Shortened my resume to 1 page** \\\\- This sounds obvious, but since I had years of experience, it would make sense that my resume would be longer than most. Looking back, I agree it was just way too long and overwhelming for recruiters.\\n* **Shortened my bullet points & highlighted numbers** \\\\- So, instead of just speaking about my responsibilities and duties, I included way more bullet points that highlight my quantifiable achievements. For each job, I had 2 points for those achievements and 1 for a responsibility that directly relates to the job I'm looking for. Some of the interviewers said that they were particularly attracted to the inclusion of these numbers. \\n* **Made it more professional** \\\\- For my professional summary, I thought I would stand out more by giving it a personality. I opened it with, \\\"Hi there, my name is XXX!\\\" You guys said that it didn't look professional and lowered the quality of the resume. So, I made it more professional, giving a quick summary of my experiences while also highlighting things the job description stated they were looking for. For example, the second sentence starts with, \\\"I can be described as a...\\\" This is where I would insert characteristics from the job description such as \\\"analytical thinker\\\" or \\\"goal-oriented.\\\" \\n* **Removed references** \\\\- This one was surprising to me. I thought it was a no-brainer to have your references on the resume to make getting those contacts easier for recruiters, but possibly not.  It takes up unnecessary space that could be used to highlight more important things.\\n* **Moved the skills section to the bottom** \\\\- There's not much to explain here. I initially had them at the top, after the professional summary section, but now it's after the work experience section. One thing I want to note is, I also used this section to highlight technical skills and/or software knowledge that the job is asking for but I couldn't fit into my bullet points. \\n* **Revise for each job** \\\\- It might take some time to do this, but I think this was a big help. For every job I'm applying to, I revise my resume template to highlight keywords from the job description.\\n* **Changed formatting** \\\\- As advised, I changed the margins to 0.5 on each side to fit more content on the page.\\n\\nAnd yeah that's about it. It's a tough job market out there right, especially for marketing and computer science, but there will be something for you.

Here are two hacks that gave me a huge advantage when I was job hunting last year and that I think everyone should be implementing.\\n\\n**1- Write a short email to anyone in the company (can be the CEO if the company is small, or anyone in the team where you would be working).**\\n\\nThe email should be concise, let the person know that you\\u2019re interested in the company and why, but more importantly mention how your skills will bring value to the company. You\\u2019ll be surprised by how many people reply, sometimes they\\u2019ll ask you for more information, like a portfolio and in turns into a back and forth conversation. This is how I was able to get a remote job last year.\\n\\nHow to get anyone\\u2019s email\\n\\nSome people recommend sending this type of messages in LinkedIn direct messages, but this wasn't very effective in my experience. Almost no one replied/saw the messages. I think a lot of people get spammed on LinkedIn messages which is why most don\\u2019t even check them.\\n\\nBut if you\\u2019re able to reach out via someone's email inbox, that's a different story. Here\\u2019s how you can get anyone\\u2019s email:\\n\\nFirst search for the company you\\u2019re applying for in linkedIn. In their LinkedIn page you\\u2019ll be able to see who works there. Look up their name in RocketReach, they\\u2019ll usually give you 2-3 email addresses. Send the email to all of those to maximize the chances of your email getting seen.\\n\\n**2-Customize your resume for each job application, add important keywords and skills from the job description**\\n\\nThis can feel tedious at times but totally worth it. Most recruiters use software that automatically rejects your application when your resume doesn\\u2019t contain certain keywords or skills from the job description. If the job description has a skill or program that you kind of know you should still include it in your resume. If you end up getting an interview just review that skill online (read about it, watch YouTube videos) a few days before the interview in case you get asked about it. It\\u2019s widely known that the majority of job posts exaggerate the skills/experience you actually need for the job anyways. For example in programming many job posts \\u201crequire\\u201d years of experience for tools or frameworks that came out last year \\ud83d\\ude02. So before applying, look at the job description and see if there\\u2019s anything important you should add/replace in your resume. Download the new version of your resume and send that one. I was doing this manually at the beginning of my job hunt and started using JobSyncAI once I stared applying to more jobs to automate the process.\\n\\nBesides those two things try to apply to 10+ jobs per day. Don\\u2019t get discouraged by rejections or if you get ghosted. Once you start landing interviews you\\u2019ll build up momentum. Good luck with your job hunt, I know it can be a stressful time but you\\u2019ll get there if you put in the time \\ud83d\\udcaa.\"", "title": "2 things I did to instantly raise my interview rate", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1b8ue28/2_things_i_did_to_instantly_raise_my_interview/"}, {"author": "A_PS4_Player", "created_utc": 1709916449.0, "link_flair_template_id": "a3643b7a-8ae9-11e5-bea4-0e0467040b93", "link_flair_text": "I have a general question", "num_comments": 1, "post_id": "1b9sqfv", "score": 1, "subreddit": "resumes", "text": "\"\"", "title": "Where can I go with this?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/4h00g0uh25nc1.png"}, {"author": "DoBetterNextTime3232", "created_utc": 1709914597.0, "link_flair_template_id": "19f3a5c0-f5cb-11ec-bbc5-12bdd01bc8ab", "link_flair_text": "Review my resume \u2022 I'm in Europe", "num_comments": 4, "post_id": "1b9ry7o", "score": 1, "subreddit": "resumes", "text": "\"I am in the middle of a career change.

For our resumes, we have a contract which details all the policies. This includes unlimited revisions until the final version is approved, along with a clause saying that the document cannot be revised, modified, etc by outside sources, as its copyrighted material, unless given permission by us as the owner of the material. \\n\\n99% of our clients are very satisfied once they approve the final version. We\\u2019re having an issue with one client, who requests consistent changes and continues to accept the final version, but then comes back for more. Most times we make the changes because we feel bad. Some changes are minimal, some call for an almost entire redesign. As the minimal changes continued, we provided the client with a version of the document they can edit to make their changes, which we gave permission for. Unfortunately, they abused the permission and began sharing it with other sources to receive suggestions for changes. Obviously every person would do something like this differently, so it is not surprising that this outside source suggested to change various sentences and such based on how they preferred. \\n\\nThis now presents a problem for us, as the document is being shared and edited with these outside sources, some of which can be seen as direct competition. The client returned to ask what we think of the changes, which we stated we cannot comment on as our copyrighted material is now in shambles (you should see how messy and unorganized they made it). It would have to be remade from scratch. We declined being able to make future changes due to breach of contract. \\n\\nThe client now says they want to either keep the editable version and allow other sources to continue to edit it, or that we should put it back and continue making indefinite changes for her ourself based on comments made by outside sources. With the breach of the contract, I do not think we should continue, as we have presented multiple final versions and have continued to offer them until she shared it elsewhere. On the other hand, knowing what she told us, we don\\u2019t want outside companies now editing and possibly replicating our formats and such.

Need some eyes on my resume to see if there is something I can do that can help improve my chances with getting interviews.\\n\\nAdmittedly I have not applied to 100's of jobs as I'm trying to be selective. I have applied to about 25-30 opportunities I've seen on LinkedIn. Many times I'll try to apply through company website if that option is available. However, I have not received one follow up for even an interview. Some of the roles I have applied for do respond via automated messages saying the role has been filled or no longer available, but that's it. The crickets are definitely out.\\n\\nI've always felt that getting a role in IT would not be an issue for me since I have many years of experience, but the landscape has undoubtedly changed considerably. I hail from NY and its no secret that layoffs in this field are rampant. It has been tough so the need to separate yourself out a bit is ever more crucial. There are still jobs out there but the competition for those roles are fierce. So at this point I'm looking for an edge but it appears that my knife is dull and need to find a way to sharpen it.\\n\\nThe part I'm trying to get my head wrapped around is that I have no idea if my resume is getting through the ATS system, and if it is, is it being rejected by recruiters...and why? Its one thing to go on a few interviews and bomb. I can eat some humble pie in that situation knowing that I have to tighten my interview techniques, but I'm not even getting through the front door to give it a try. That is why I'm thinking my resume is problematic.\\n\\nI have spent plenty of time modifying my resume (format, font, layout and content. Condensing it down to 2 pages was a chore and even then I'm thinking its not where it needs to be.\\n\\nSome questions I've asked myself:\\n\\nDoes it contain too much fluff per role? Should I reduce line items and for the ones I keep should I make sure they all show impact?\\n\\nShould I remove some line items and increase size of my font (currently using arial narrow)?\\n\\nShould I keep or remove the executive summary? Plenty of opinions from people on being for it vs against. The current summary is an example of role I applied for Director of IT. The example provided was tailored to it.\\n\\nI have listed only my last 3 roles/experiences as those are the most relevant. I have left off the other roles primarily because of space. Good, bad, indifferent?\\n\\nIs it simply a numbers game and I have to keep applying until something sticks?\\n\\nShould I be applying on multiple job boards like indeed / Glassdoor / monster? I've concentrated on LinkedIn only up til now.\\n\\nNote that I have run my resume through several  resume checkers and originally was getting low score but I have improved it significantly since then to score over 80 consistently. I also copied/pasted to a text editor as some have suggested to see if the formatting is acceptable or terribly bad. I did catch quite a few things that I didn't realize existed but were absent from view on my resume so that exercise was definitely useful. I feel I'm going in the right direction with where I'm trying to improve yet I feel stuck.\\n\\nI have attached a copy of my resume. Any comment or suggestion (good or bad) is welcome.

Would a recruiter be frustrated at the murky timeline?\\n\\n**Company 2 name** \\\\- Technical Writing Manager \\\\[dates\\\\] - Technical Writer \\\\[dates\\\\]\\n\\n* lorem\\n* ipsum\\n* hocus \\n* pocus\\n\\n**Company 1 name** \\\\- \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Associate \\\\[dates\\\\] - \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ Specialist \\\\[dates\\\\]\\n\\n* lorem\\n* ipsum\\n* hocus \\n* pocus\\n\\nI'm really big on readability / scanability, so another drawback for me here would be the large walls of bullets without the different titles breaking them up halfway(ish) down. I just haven't been able to get over the \\\"persisting duties\\\" puzzle. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso this is 100% a silly fixation that's stopping me from just doing the thing.
