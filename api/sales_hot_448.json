It\\u2019s setting us all up for massive failure.\\n\\nHe is constantly cancelling 1:1 meetings, but when we have them, I just this weird jealous girlfriend speech about how he knows I talk to the ops team more often than I talk to him, and that he has \\u201cno idea what I\\u2019m doing all day\\u201d if I\\u2019m not texting him daily outside all of all zoom calls. I genuinely am fully able to update him on everything in the calls, we have about 30 opps going at a time, I add a new one per week. There are 450 gas utility companies total in the U.S. so what we\\u2019re doing, chugging along, is the most efficient way. It\\u2019s slow, but it works.\\n\\nHe invited himself on the last three customer calls I made all over the country. He added zero value, and was just a super awkward looming entity during the lunch meetings where I love to really get to know the people I\\u2019m talking to. He was a logistical mess, had no idea where we were going and just showed up at the airport with zero plan. When I asked him how he planned to get to the airport from 2.5 hours away in the Texas desert, he thought he could Uber.\\n\\nMy guy there are no Ubers here. You will have better luck riding an armadillo there.\\n\\nHe also attended a conference, and was MIA the entire week with little communication. That was fine by me, but if you flew to a conference, why the fuck would you not attend it? These things cost thousands of dollars to attend. It was just strange. When he did show up, he was visibly miserable, and again, offered no help or strategy for how we could get more leads from this poorly planned event.\\n\\nOf course, he had absolutely no sales experience before he became VP of business development. He was an accountant for years at our company, but is neighbors and friends with the previous owner. He is, most likely a magnificent accountant, as long as he doesn\\u2019t talk to people. \\n\\nThis is a rant after his most recent tirade and \\u201cdemand for respect\\u201d from me and the rest of the sales team as someone who is confidently soldiering on with help from other useful people in leadership.

To do this, a manager might give certain suggestions such as be available for appointments, be trustworthy or likable enough to buy a car from, follow up with prospective buyers, follow up with past buyers for repeat business and referrals, know the car value on a high level, etc. \\n\\nBut if a car sales person's job was like how my job as a SaaS/Software/Services sales person has been the past 10 years, it would look like this:\\n\\n1. Sell x amount of cars and car $ per month. \\n2. Sell $x amount in car maintenance contracts per month. This should total about 20% of your total car sales per month, no more and no less. \\n\\nPLUS, do each of the following. The failure to do these will result in a PIP and/or termination. \\n\\n1. A week before quarter end, forecast with 100% accuracy how many cars you will sell this month and over the next quarter.\\n2. Make 5 test drives per day. \\n3. Generate 5 potential car buyer leads per week and enter these into the CRM system.\\n4. Generate a Close Plan for each of these 5 car buyer leads. For each car buyer, document who the decision maker is, who the influencer is, who has veto power, what past relationships they have with other car buyers, where they went to college, and then develop a strategy for ensuring each of these becomes a loyal customer. \\n5. Meet weekly with BDR to generate a potential car buyer prospecting plan.\\n6. Follow up on every BDR lead. It doesn't matter if these leads are tire kickers with bankruptcy issues and low income -- follow up with them and make miracles happen. Convert as many of these leads to qualified opportunities as possible. \\n7. Generate an Outreach drip campaign wherein three times per week you send out marketing emails to contacts you've entered into your CRM system. Send out 100 to 200 Outreach emails per week to these while obtaining a 40% open rate on these emails. \\n8. Provide a list of 1000s of names and addresses of potential buyers for our marketing department to review then ignore. \\n9. Attend car buyer conferences. Follow up with every single person who visits our booth and enter them as a lead. \\n10. Response to every slack from every dealership employee in a timely manner. Be \\\"available\\\" on Slack all day every day, even when out on test drives meeting with potential car buyers.\\n11. Weekly video calls with representatives in our Services, Finance, Marketing, Facilities departments. Build relationships with them before you are re-assigned new representatives next month. \\n12. Update every lead and every call every single day in CRM. \\n13. Respond to daily emails from the Dealership ownership/management who do not have time to review your CRM updates. \\n14. Prepare a quarterly presentation for Dealership ownership that summarizes every thing above. You will spend a week preparing these following our precise 30-slide format, then you will spend three days offsite listening to everyone present these same slide decks.\\n15. Join weekly team sales meetings, weekly 1:1 meetings, weekly Zoom \\\"Happy Hours,\\\" monthly \\\"feel good brown bag Zoom lunch\\\" meetings, monthly all-hands meetings, quarterly all-hands meetings, annual all-hands meetings.\\n16. Etc. etc. etc. \\n17. Etc. etc. etc.\\n18. Etc. etc. etc.\\n19. Etc. etc. etc. \\n20. Remember -- you are the CEO of your own business. This your business to run. \\n21. We reserve the right to terminate you at any time to ensure we make our profit number and our CxOs can make their annual bonuses. \\n\\n&#x200B;\"", "title": "If A Car Dealership Were Modern Software Sales", "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1bgf5l1/if_a_car_dealership_were_modern_software_sales/"}, {"author": "Chilove2021", "created_utc": 1710609875.0, "link_flair_template_id": "5d7b6946-0047-11e3-ab17-12313b0cf20e", "link_flair_text": "Sales Topic General Discussion", "num_comments": 105, "post_id": "1bgb88p", "score": 25, "subreddit": "sales", "text": "\"I'm always interested to hear what other folks are selling, especially if it's unique or interesting or super niche.

I came from a heavy outbound role in the SaaS world so going inbound and doing really well for a great company was beyond my dreams. I was consistently a top 2 rep on a team of 15-20 and just really enjoyed everything about it. I liked the remote nature, loved the companies I was talking to and my customers, and I was building residual income and making more each month and year than I ever had before. As the company grew they naturally hired a VP and Sales Director (who were friends) and around that time I had a lot of personal things going on (going through a serious breakup, and decided to go to rehab to get sober) I've remained sober the past three years and was even transparent with my boss at the time why I needed to take a leave and they seemed nothing but supportive. Right before I left I was in talks with the VP about an obvious promotion due to my success.  \\nWhen I got back a month later however, things had changed - there was the new Sales Director who I don't think liked me very much due to the fact that he was trying to change things in the sales process that I didn't really adapt to because what I was doing was continuing to work. Also, when I came back, a younger female teammate who I'd consistently outperformed was now my new manager. It took me a second to get back in the groove but I continued to close 10-15 deals per month. Out of nowhere though, I got let go and was told it was due to lack of internal and external communication with clients. There was a bit of churn but nothing out of the ordinary. Additionally, I had been missing some of the daily standups because I was in an outpatient program at that time. I had communicated this and it seemed to be fine. Additionally, the new sales director was trying to implement new technologies (chilipiper to be exact) that I voiced my disagreement with because I thought it was going overboard on the frequency with which it was reaching out to our prospects.  \\nAnyway, since then both the VP and Sales Director no longer work at the company and the younger manager that fired me seemingly is now head of the senior sales team. I really miss the job, and have not held any related sales jobs since getting sober but I think I'd still excel in the role. Am I wrong to reach out and see if they'd hire me back? I quesiton it because I reached out to both the CEO and the President when I was initially terminated (cc'ing the then VP) explaining my situation but I never heard anything back.

I came from a heavy outbound role in the SaaS world so going inbound and doing really well for a great company was beyond my dreams. I was consistently a top 2 rep on a team of 15-20 and just really enjoyed everything about it. I liked the remote nature, loved the companies I was talking to and my customers, and I was building residual income and making more each month and year than I ever had before. As the company grew they naturally hired a VP and Sales Director (who were friends) and around that time I had a lot of personal things going on (going through a serious breakup, and decided to go to rehab to get sober) I've remained sober the past three years and was even transparent with my boss at the time why I needed to take a leave and they seemed nothing but supportive. Right before I left I was in talks with the VP about an obvious promotion due to my success. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhen I got back a month later however, things had changed - there was the new Sales Director who I don't think liked me very much due to the fact that he was trying to change things in the sales process that I didn't really adapt to because what I was doing was continuing to work. Also, when I came back, a younger female teammate who I'd consistently outperformed was now my new manager. It took me a second to get back in the groove but I continued to close 10-15 deals per month. Out of nowhere though, I got let go and was told it was due to lack of internal and external communication with clients. There was a bit of churn but nothing out of the ordinary. Additionally, I had been missing some of the daily standups because I was in an outpatient program at that time. I had communicated this and it seemed to be fine. Additionally, the new sales director was trying to implement new technologies (chilipiper to be exact) that I voiced my disagreement with because I thought it was going overboard on the frequency with which it was reaching out to our prospects. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway, since then both the VP and Sales Director no longer work at the company and the younger manager that fired me seemingly is now head of the senior sales team. I really miss the job, and have not held any related sales jobs since getting sober but I think I'd still excel in the role. Am I wrong to reach out and see if they'd hire me back? I quesiton it because I reached out to both the CEO and the President when I was initially terminated (cc'ing the then VP) explaining my situation but I never heard anything back. Maybe something else was going on they weren't telling me about but I was surprised. I'm looking for advice to see if it's worth reaching back out and asking for the job back.

This guide is specifically focused on how to create outbound email messaging, it doesn't cover the tech stack, etc. \\n\\n**Couple notes:**\\n\\n* Getting people's attention and \\\"hooking\\\" them is a crucial part of business.\\n* If you're an SDR, this is another skill to add to your skillset\\n* If you're an AE, you can rely on your SDR less and hunt for yourself.\\n* If you write great messaging, you can eventually outsource this and have someone else do it for you.\\n* If you're a Founder, you can also use this skill.\\n\\n**===**\\n\\n**Who is this for?:**\\n\\n* Anyone who sells to an audience that's in front of their computer.\\n* FOR: Computer-oriented industries: E-Commerce, Internet, Software. Etc.\\n* NOT FOR: Less computer-oriented industries: Restaurants, Construction, Lawyers. Etc. These industries require your prospects to be out of the office. They're always on the move.\\n* Cold email is not for you if your audience is constantly out of the office or away from their computer. Cold calling is better. SMBs, mom-and-pop shops, and other small businesses are best reached over the phone. Cold email would not be beneficial if you sell to these audiences.\\n\\n**===**\\n\\n**Why cold email?:**\\n\\n* Rejection proof. Less dealing with assholes or rude responses like you would in cold-calling.\\n* Automated and scalable: able to touch multiple prospects at once.\\n* You don't need someone to pick up the phone to deliver the message. The message will be delivered regardless.\\n* Long-term, high-value skill that can be applied to a variety of business avenues.\\n\\n**Assumptions I have about you:**\\n\\n* You already know who your ICP is (target role and target company).\\n* You know how to use mail merging tools for mass outreach.\\n* You know how to use data enrichment tools like to grab people's contact info.\\n\\nIf you don't know how to do the above, you should learn. It'll make this program more effective.\\n\\n**Do not:**\\n\\n* Rely on SDR 100%. No idea how to fend for themselves and hunt. This means they underachieve or never hit their full potential.\\n* Spam and piss off prospects. Blast without discernment or without high-converting messaging. You need quality and quantity to succeed at this game.\\n* Cold call when they should be cold emailing. (See above about computer-oriented professions).\\n\\n**===**\\n\\n# Cold Email Messaging:\\n\\n**Lesson 1: Intro and Mindset**\\n\\n* Cold emails are a normal part of B2B business.\\n* Your prospects receive 10-15 cold emails in their inbox every day. They expect to get cold emails, and it's normalized.\\n* **ICP**: Make sure you're emailing the right people.\\n* **Messaging**: Follow my cold email copywriting scripts, and you'll get responses.\\n* **Timing**: Difficult to get right, but this is why we want to re-approach prospects every few months. We must hit their inbox when they are considering new options.\\n* **Multi-threading:** Always reach out to a few people on the team.\\n* **Re-approaching:** See Timing above. Try again every few months with improved messaging.\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\n**Lesson 2: Cold-Email Must-Haves**\\n\\nYour cold emails must include most, if not all, of these traits below. A multi-touch campaign that hammers on these points over and over again, it becomes easier to stand out (and get a response).\\n\\n**Cold email guidelines:**\\n\\n* Lead with their **challenges**. It's all about THEM. They are the main character in the movie. So, make the email all about them and their challenges.\\n* **ONE** main idea and **no more than 5-6 short sentences**.\\n* **Casual** subject line.\\n* Simple personalization + \\\"Wet the Beak\\\" Technique. I always start the first line of a cold email with, *\\\"You might be interested in a tool that will allow you to...\\\"*\\n* **BASIC explanation of what you do, how you do it, and how you do it better. Focus on differentiators right off the bat.** Make it easy for them to quickly grasp why they should take a meeting with you.\\n* **Social proof:** *\\\"We work with 200+ customers, including Apple, Microsoft, and Meta...\\\"* to lower their wall and increase trust (we're the one sending the cold email, so we have to establish credibility and trust...FAST!)\\n* **Simple language:** I can't stress this one enough. Write like you talk. Avoid big words or corporate jargon. Keep it clear, crisp, and concise. Your grandma should be able to understand what you're trying to say.\\n* **Metrics**: Close rate, success rates, NPS score, conversion rates, etc. Must be factual. Do not lie or exaggerate.\\n* **CTA: Call to action**. Must be direct. \\\"What does your schedule look like for a quick, 15-minute intro?\\\". Do NOT be passive: \\\"Please let me know if this interests you\\\". Go for the ask and make it clear what you want: **a meeting.**\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\n**Lesson 3: Subject Line Tricks**\\n\\nBiggest take away from this lesson is to keep your subject lines informal and vague. Informal because it makes it seem like the email is coming from someone on the \\\"inside\\\". Someone they know. But you also want to keep it vague. This is what gets them to open the email.\\n\\n**Subject line guidelines:**\\n\\n* Always keep it casual, using lowercase\\n* Conversational tone\\n* Write the subject line AS IF it was coming from the inside, but don't \\\"trick\\\" them too hard, or it'll backfire.\\n* Imagine a spectrum between formal and informal subject lines. You want to be in the middle of that spectrum. Keep it professional, but not too professional.\\n* VAGUE is better. Salesly subject lines = auto-delete. Let me say it again: salesly is auto-delete.\\n\\n**Subject line examples. You can play with the rules. The only rule is to spark curiosity.**\\n\\n* \\\"Question about \\\\[COMPANY's\\\\] marketing stack\\\"\\n* \\\"Question about...\\\"\\n* \\\"Idea for \\\\[COMPANY's\\\\] demo conversion rates\\\"\\n* \\\"Idea for...\\\"- \\\"CRM suggestion for \\\\[COMPANY's\\\\] sales team\\\"\\n* \\\"Suggestion for...\\\"\\n\\n**You can also lead with benefits.**\\n\\n* \\\"Win more deals with \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\"\\n* \\\"Increase renewal rates with \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\"\\n* \\\"Sales idea for \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\"\\n* \\\"Email open rate idea for \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\"\\n* \\\"Advice for \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ cold emails\\\"\\n\\nSubject lines are an art. Have fun with this!\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\n**Lesson 4: Steal from Top Performers**\\n\\nYou must \\\"steal\\\" templates, scripts, and cadences from top performers. This is the shortcut to success, mixed with your cold email talents. The biggest mistake you can make is try to reinvent the wheel. Don't do it. Steal first. Reinvent the wheel later after you've seen what works and what doesn't.\\n\\n**Create the following Salesforce (or whatever CRM you use) reports:**\\n\\n* **Generated opps by week:** How were they generated? What cadence/templates? How many touches?\\n* **Closed-won by week:** How were the opps generated? What cadence/templates?\\n* **Closed-lost:** Look through Closed-lost reports to see if there are any high-performing cadences/templates. There is a lot of gold hidden in a closed-lost report.\\n\\nThe reports will help you find what works. Salesforce tells the truth of what works and what doesn't. Mine the data for your benefit.\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\n**Lesson 5: Savvy Multi-Threading**\\n\\nFor your cold email campaigns, you almost always want to multi-thread. This means reaching out to multiple relevant people in an organization.\\n\\nThe only exception is for companies with fewer than 100 people. At small companies, it's not uncommon for your prospects to be sitting right next to each other in the office. The rule of thumb is that the bigger the company, the more people you can throw into your email campaign.\\n\\n**Here's my guidance:**\\n\\n* 0-100 employees: 1-2 people\\n* 100-1000 employees: 2-3 people\\n* 1000-10,000 employees: 3-4 people\\n* For your cold email campaigns, you almost always want to multi-thread. This means reaching out to multiple relevant people in an organization. The only exception is for companies with fewer than 100 people. At small companies, it's not uncommon for your prospects to be sitting right next to each other in the office. The rule of thumb is that the bigger the company, the more people you can throw into your email campaign.\\n\\nSometimes, you'll create a \\\"groundswell\\\" effect. For example, I like to email an individual contributor, the manager, and the VP. This gets them talking about it internally. So, by the time your cold-call comes, they know the name.\\n\\nOther times, you will have the wrong person forward your email to the right person. This actually happens a lot. I've landed many opportunities because I accidentally emailed the wrong person. Luckily, they'd forward my content to the right people.\\n\\nEither way, multi-threading is a must-do to get a response. Be smart with multi-threading. With cold emails, you want to err on the side of playing it safe. Don't abuse the system and get blocked or reported for spam.\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\n**Lesson 6: Personalization at Scale**\\n\\nThis is an important lesson. \\\"Personalization\\\" is the least-understood concept in cold emailing. You'll hear a lot of Sales Gurus tell you, *\\\"You should personalize your cold emails!\\\"* I disagree 100%.\\n\\n**Rule of thumb: the more emails you have to send, the less personalization you can afford to do.**\\n\\nMost B2B sellers who are prospecting at scale must have a high quantity to succeed. So, you don't want to spend too much time personalizing every email. There is a trick, though. We can personalize it\\u2014not to the individual, however, but to the persona.\\n\\n* DO NOT personalize to individuals.\\n* **Personalize to PERSONAS**.\\n* This means writing cold emails to your ICP. Cold emails that only your ICP can relate to. Pain points only Directors and VPs of your ideal client base would understand. For example, I write cold emails for HR Directors at Series A-C startups. The messaging is specifically tailored to this audience and this audience only. It resonates with the unique challenges they are facing. And if anyone else reads the email, it will confuse them. But the HR Directors I am targeting? They resonate deeply with the content I am sending, and thus, I am able to provoke a response.\\n* Cold emails personalized to the unique pain points of your target audience. This is how you personalize your cold emails at scale. This is how you achieve resonance AT SCALE. Speak to the persona (role, industry, business type, company size, etc).\\n* Listen to Gong calls. Research CRM closed-won and closed-lost notes, G2 reviews, and Reddit conversations. What common pain points do you see over and over again? These are the universal pain points and challenges you want to put in your cold email.\\n* Only personalization you need: Name, company, challenges/benefits.\\n* When writing, focus on what will resonate with a large % of your prospects. Do not waste time personalizing to the individual. Speak to the persona. Create an email campaign that will resonate with the largest % of people.\\n\\n**I want to emphasize how valuable it is to listen to Gong calls and listen to the pain points.** You want to use your prospect's exact verbiage in your cold emails. This is how you tailor your cold emails and speak the language of your prospects.  **I can't stress enough how important it is to know your ICP and their pain points.**\\n\\n**---**\\n\\n**Random important stuff:**\\n\\n* Re-do leads/cadences every 4+ months. People forget all the time. They are not going to remember your cold email from 120+ days ago. Especially when so many other sellers are doing the same. Re-approach. It works.\\n* **Cadences**: If personal, 1-3 touches. If cold email, 4-8 touches. Mix with cold calls and LinkedIn messages. I've seen campaigns with 12-16 touches total (cold calls, LinkedIn, cold email combo). I personally don't think you need that much, but if it works, it works.\\n* Your cold email should include nothing but **PLAIN TEXT**. This means zero links, attachments, images, bullet points, or fancy fonts. You want your email to come across as if it's a personal email from a friend. Once you start adding all the fancy stuff, it loses that \\\"personal\\\" touch. Avoid.\\n* Do not lie over-exaggerate. Reputation is important in B2B. Be bold, but be mindful.\\n* You must \\\"steal\\\" templates, scripts, and cadences from top performers. This is the shortcut to success, mixed with your cold email talents. The biggest mistake you can make is try to reinvent the wheel. Don't do it. Steal first. Reinvent the wheel later after you've seen what works and what doesn't.\\n* **Metrics for success:** response rates. Track what generates the most opportunities. That's it. You'll know when you've got the messaging right. Almost immediately, the responses start trickling in if the messaging is accurate.\"", "title": "Cold Email Copywriting Guide for B2B Sellers", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1be6eik/cold_email_copywriting_guide_for_b2b_sellers/"}, {"author": "ryanraad", "created_utc": 1710388296.0, "link_flair_template_id": "bdab74fe-cd00-11e5-a1b1-0ee60891a65b", "link_flair_text": "Sales Careers", "num_comments": 14, "post_id": "1bec1av", "score": 6, "subreddit": "sales", "text": "\"This company scouted me for a good 4 months and their initial offer is embarrassingly low.

When we got trained together, this other guy was reallly bad. By the 4th day our boss would kind of pick on him and ask him why he cant get the script down and why hes so nervous. Hinting that hes maybe not the right fit or whatever, and why he cant get the simple intro down.\\n\\nThe thing is that this guy is getting more leads than me. I feel like hes generating more results, but its weird that my boss seems to critique him more harshly. Ive only generated one lead per day. The other guy is getting around 2-3 per day.

Ive tried adding more tonal range but it feels artificial and people hang up quicker because it sounds sales-pitchy.

I think its a ticking time bomb before my boss starts calling me out, and warning me that the other guy may beat me out. Its just that the other guy is a week ahead of me, so once i show a larger sample size of (less) leads i think he will treat me like im on the hot seat.\\n\\nMy only saving grace compared to the other guy is im very presentable, 27 years old, professional attitude,  more confident, just flat toned.

We are working on that number now. Once you hit that number, your commissions payout on a deal will be based on the gross margin for the deal. The margin goal is 65% for all deals which pays at 8% commission. As margin goes up the percentage goes up, as margin goes down the percentage goes down. Anything less than 20% gross margin will not be paid commissions.  \\nFor example, on a $100K software and services deal which averages 65% gross margin, you would be paid commissions on approximately $65K, or $5,200 in commissions.  For each 10% higher or lower the gross margin is on average it will be a point higher or lower that you get paid on. For example a deal at 80% margin would result in 10% commissions, where a deal at 40% margin would result in a 6% commissions. This curve should be finished shortly but will follow this logic.\\\"\\n\\nNow being a State/Local I am not doing deals in the 100k, but rather my deals fall between 1-15k.

I have an offer for a BDR Role in a SaaS company selling Accounts Payable solution.\\n\\nMy situation-\\n\\nI spent 1.5 years working in tech sales in my country, solely handling inbound leads. Then, I moved countries for my studies, and since last July, I've been applying and interviewing. I won't lie, it's been exhausting. Most of my applications have been for SDR/BDR roles, and I've managed to secure an offer for a BDR position, where I'll be focusing on outbound leads. Admittedly, my experience in outbound is limited, though I did talk myself up during the interview. Apparently, they bought into it, as they seemed to love my approach, my answers, and verbally offered me the job by the end of it.\\n\\nThe job requires relocating from my current city to a smaller city. It'll be slightly cheaper, but the whole moving process\\u2014packing, relocating, unpacking\\u2014is a hassle. Currently, I have an okay job in customer service at a public company, paying about 80% of what the new job offers. There's a slim chance I could transition internally to an analyst role, but I'm not banking on it. My boss mentioned we'll \\\"figure something out\\\" after my probation period, but I'm sceptical.\\n\\nOn the upside, I'm finally landing a job. Sure, the base pay is lower, but with incentives, it's just shy of the average. If I do well, I could touch 100k in 3-4 years (100k is pretty hard in EU) The company is small but established. They have a substantial local customer base. My potential boss seemed genuine and invested in me during our conversation. He even mentioned going above and beyond their usual pay scale for SDRs and assured me of assistance with my work visa once probation is complete. They've done it before for someone else, so I'm optimistic.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI view this role as a stepping stone rather than my ultimate destination. However, I'm nervous about starting with prospecting since it's not my forte. Meeting targets will be challenging, especially since securing my work visa is my top priority. I really want to take this but I am shit scared how will I even start with my prospecting since I dont have a lot of experience doing it. Target will be hard and I want and need to do very well to complete my probation since work visa is my top priority. \\n\\nWhat do you think? Am I overthinking this?

The simple idea is we help people who are struggling with tax debt. You have the Openers whose job is to qualify candidates who have submitted an application to us and then convince them to sign on to our \\u201cFresh Start\\u201d programs with money down. And then you have the Closers who\\u2019s job is to call back the signed clients once the \\u201ctax investigation\\u201d has been completed, and then go over the Resolution plan as well as the final cost for our services. The cost to initially sign them on is a few hundred dollars, the cost for the final price for our services can be anywhere between thousands of dollars to tens of thousands of dollars (it depends on the amount they owe to the IRS, and the complexity of the resolution plan).\\n \\nI\\u2019ve been working for this company for a year. It\\u2019s my first sales job, and to me it was an absolute blast in the beginning. I made quota the first month and have consistently made quota for months on end. To me, sales is a sport that requires constant growth and adaptation. The money is nice, sure, but I see it as mostly a by-product of excellent performance. The better you perform, the more money you make. I don\\u2019t care much to spend it though (I\\u2019m a bit of a cheap ass). I do sales because it\\u2019s fun, plain and simple.\\n \\nBut lately all that has changed for me with this company. Ever since I first started, I was always weary of what exactly we were selling and what exactly was happening with these clients. As an Opener you feel mostly closed off from the Closers, like there was some kind of an invisible iron curtain between the 2 groups. So, I went ahead and befriended some of the Closers, and they would always say vague things on what it was that we were doing exactly. There *was* one Closer however that was pretty blunt in saying that what we were doing was \\u201ccomplete bullshit.\\u201d You build a perceived value and sell the client on a flimsy idea, and you do that by mostly utilizing fear tactics and creating urgency that wasn\\u2019t really there (at least not yet). What put weight to their words was the simple fact that this Closer was one of the best in the group. Though these doubts and questions continued to linger in my mind, I ultimately chose to ignore them. I wanted to grow, I wanted to win, I wanted to become a Closer and be part of the big dogs.\\n \\nAnd after a few months of consistently meeting quota and steadily increasing my numbers with each month, I was promoted. I had finally become a Closer. Now I got to peak behind the iron curtain and have a better idea of what\\u2019s going on, and so far my doubts have been multiplied. What gets to me is the fact that we\\u2019re selling a service at thousands of dollars to people who are money illiterate, broke, depressed, and sometimes downright suicidal. We get them to pay these fees by helping them apply for loans, and we sometimes lie about their income on the loan application in order to increase the chances of getting the loan accepted.\\n \\nWhat first planted the idea that maybe, just maybe, I needed to leave is the simple fact that I\\u2019m just not closing the Resolution deals. I went from being one of the best Openers to now being the single worse Closer. I\\u2019ve tried mastering the script and learning the technicalities of reading IRS transcripts, but nothing seems to be working. My Director went as far as saying that there\\u2019s nothing else he can teach me to improve my game, and that I simply need to \\u201cget my ass in gear.\\u201d In a sense he\\u2019s right, but I think at the core of it all is the fact that I\\u2019ve just lost faith in the company and the service. \\n\\nOn top of all that, in just a mere few weeks the company seems to have embraced this \\u201chustle culture/sales bro\\u201d shit that I absolutely despise. Quality has been sacrificed for quantity, and we now have Openers who are flat out lying to the clients (like claiming they\\u2019ve worked for the company for years to make them seem \\u201cexperienced,\\u201d when they\\u2019ve only worked there for 2 months), and I\\u2019m starting to see this behavior being actively encouraged by the superiors. I was told in the very beginning when I was hired that this direction was one in which the company wanted to avoid, but that has clearly been thrown out the window.  \\n \\nWhat officially solidified the idea that I needed to leave however was a case that I just had. I had a client that is currently jobless and honestly couldn\\u2019t afford the services, but he insisted on finding ways to pay us because he felt he needed the service. During one of his rants however, he vaguely hints at suicide. This made me uncomfortable, because if this guy is actually contemplating suicide then that would mean he\\u2019s not thinking clearly, and yet he was still insisting on paying for a service that he couldn\\u2019t afford, and that just felt off to me. I told my Director my concerns and his answer was something along the lines of, \\u201cthat\\u2019s just sales, get over it. You\\u2019re becoming emotional, that\\u2019s why you\\u2019re not closing those Resolution deals.\\u201d I left the office to take a break, and when I found a private, quiet place, I started to cry.\\n \\nIt was a whirlwind of emotions. I hate losing, and I was beginning to feel embarrassed by my performance. But I also felt tricked and used. I see my skills at gaining trust and extracting information as a tool that could help people and ultimately make a good living out of it, but I felt like it was currently being used more as a weapon to take advantage of people. I also started to realize that the single worse thing that is ruining my Resolution deals is the fact that I simply cannot respond to the clients\\u2019 rebuttals, and the reason for this is because I mostly  agree with the rebuttals when they are presented. \\n\\nThe only thing that pulled me out of this despair however, was the thought of actively searching for another job. There **must** be a company out there that is selling a product/service that is actually cool and exciting, something that people actually would want to buy, and one in which I could make good money in selling. The world is so much bigger than just this tax relief firm and that is what\\u2019s getting me excited.\\n \\nThis is where I need you guys\\u2019 perspective and ideas:\\n \\nI\\u2019m currently updating my resume and linkedin profile, but in what direction should I take this? What industry should I look into? I want to sell a product/service that is cool and useful, I want to work with clients who have money and who are smart (I was actually told by my Director that I needed to stop talking like a doctor because it was alienating the clients that we were working with), and I want to make good money while doing all this. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t mind negotiating because I love negotiating, and I don\\u2019t mind aggressively prospecting because, as odd as it may sound, prospecting is fun for me (though it can get depressing when no one seems to be biting, but the mere fact that the next client could be that one \\u201cyes\\u201d that I\\u2019ve been searching for keeps me fired up). I do have a flaw in which I can be somewhat blunt and can ask questions in the wrong way that can straight up piss off clients and ruin deals, but that can be fixed through time and experience.\\n \\nHow do I go about this? Where should I look? How should I present my resume to not only show my responsibilities but also my results? What references should I use since I can\\u2019t use anyone in my current job?\\n\\n Am I just overreacting?\\n \\nWhat do you guys think?

The first call with the recruiter went really well. It was laid back, and from the start, it felt like a conversation I'd have with someone while sitting at a bar. The second interview was with the Head of Sales. He showed up 10 minutes late and said he lost track of time messaging on Slack. He had zero energy and looked like he didn't want to be there. Granted, it was an early morning call.\\n\\n  \\nToday I had my second interview with the Head of Sales that was a deep dive into my resume to learn about how successful I was in sales. He showed up 15 minutes late, again, because his wife had put his passport in the washer, and he had to pick up his passport today. He started from my time in high school, asking questions like what my marks were like and what courses I enjoyed, through to university, and then my sales career. He asked questions ranging from where I worked during high school, extracurricular, how I spent my time when I wasn't at school or with friends. Bulk of his questions seemed odd and weren't related to sales at all.\\n\\n  \\nWhen we got to my work history, he asked very basic questions. At the end when I was trying to close the interview/discuss next steps, he said this interview was to learn more about me as a person and the last stage is focused on how well I can sell. I thought that was the focus on this interview as he had said...\\n\\n  \\nA few things rubbed me the wrong way: Showing up late twice, outright yawned twice on our call today (actually got closer to the camera to yawn both times), asking invasive questions like how much I made at the first company I worked for and what they're getting now (first company is a well-known Canadian company, but they didn't pay well when I was there and I made the switch to another company because of a few reasons including better pay), why I didn't work while in University, and a few others. The questions, especially regarding high school and University, were questions you'd ask someone who is applying for a part-time job while attending high school and doesn't have real-world experience.\\n\\n  \\nHas anyone ever experienced something like this?

I naturally asked many questions about the last interactions with them and my boss explained that he didn\\u2019t know why or what happened and kept saying that he thought it was racism (which I find extremely dubious since the company is very diverse) but armed with no knowledge of what to expect I dutifully did as requested and made contact with the person responsible for the purchasing (a different person than was formally in charge) I set up a meeting with her to follow up and my boss was elated to find out the news of a new contact (the old one was bad you see) and we proceeded to compile the relevant information for their history with us. \\n\\nLast week was the day of the meeting and my boss wanted to go with me and when we arrived and met our contact we where informed that their was a misunderstanding and that the person that had already been dealing with us was indeed the person we needed to speak with.
