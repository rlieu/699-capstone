They explained that another team wanted to present me with the opportunity (a small part of what I do in my current role) to transfer to (other) team. The role pays 80k (a 30k haircut), allows me to stay remote, and will most likely be a large step down in responsibility. I should note that there is also a generous 401k plan. \\n\\nWhile working through the PIP.. I interviewed elsewhere and was offered a hybrid position paying 100k (3 days wfh).

Would it be too late to start studying for an accounting&audit master's in order to join one of the big4 in a neighboring city so I can earn relevant work experience? Would I be at a major disadvantage in front of my peers? Would they even consider hiring me? Could my mixed work experience I have from my past impact me negatively? Would I have any chances of staying and building a career here if I go for the ACCA or an OMBA? Would I ever be considered for a promotion considering my age? I know they also recruit from masters but I would be 29 y/o by the time I finish if I can't manage to apply earlier, how late would that be?\\n\\nSo long story short, I have graduated university in 2019 with a Bachelor's in International Business (not knowing any better) , which is a pretty universal, not very specialized degree focusing on business administration and import/export regulations. Right after graduation, I was having trouble finding a job so I enrolled in a hotel management school for a hotel management degree of all things, which I thought that in combination with my finance degree would make me a more attractive candidate in the job market, with me having new skills under my belt such as people management and budget planning. It did not.\\n\\nI ended up as a night auditor at a local hotel with the promise of a promotion in the finance department in a few months, and that's when the pandemic hit in 2020. Things started going downhill and I got laid off in 2021. In 2022 the situation was pretty bad so all career plans went out the window as I now had to put food on the table. I managed to get a job in the manufacturing industry in my city, working in the finance department in AP/AR roles, where I've advanced from an AR assistant role to an AP analyst one, which includes supervisorial duties.\\n\\nThings are now looking better and I'm trying to pull my head out of my ass. I'm tired of working in this complete mediocrity with no advancement chances and for what it's worth, I'm trying to turn my life around. I'm targeting a master's degree, hopefully a more relevant one for now, and in the future 5-7 years I hope to be admitted to an online MBA at a US University as an international student. To be able to do that, I need a more substantial education under my belt and significant work experience for renowned, well known companies.\\n\\nThere's a neighboring city right next to mine which has offices from all of the big4. Obviously, they recruit from the local university, and you have to be a graduate or a final-year student as a bachelor or master's. Having graduated my bachelors years ago, my last chance to join them would be now if I signed up for master's this summer. I'm thinking of moving there and starting a master's in Accounting-Audit and trying my best to join them. How plausible would this be / what are my chances considering I'm 27 y/o living in central/eastern Europe and with mixed work experience? Is it too late to join them at 27y/o? Can my past work experience in Hospitality and finance AP/AR affect my chances? Should I hide my hotel experience or the hotel management school from my CV?\\n\\nAs it stands now, I wouldn't mind the level I'm getting in, junior or assistant would be great, I would even be happy with an internship, as this would be my last chance to really turn my career around and to try to nullify the effects of the pandemic and my own incompetence.\\n\\nThanks again to everyone who took their time to read all this and for all the answers.\"", "title": "Is it too late for me to pivot to a Big 4 as a 27 Y/O?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bh3srh/is_it_too_late_for_me_to_pivot_to_a_big_4_as_a_27/"}, {"author": "murrman00", "created_utc": 1710697863.0, "link_flair_template_id": "6406c11c-86ad-11e6-86c2-0e0536d0c06b", "link_flair_text": "Job searching", "num_comments": 8, "post_id": "1bh3q53", "score": 2, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"This is purely anecdotal, but I\\u2019ve noticed while looking for jobs on LinkedIn, it seems like number of postings have dropped significantly.\\n\\nI have my filters set to the last 24 hours and look every day for data analyst jobs.

Also since I just went through a break up and I\\u2019m going through stuff personally this just added more fuel to the fire as I broke down. (Not the BEST place to do so).

She keeps doing everything herself and I feel like cuz she doesn\\u2019t want to wait on me and teach me. I asked her if she could please help me out in this because I AM new to food retail. I emphasized that part cuz she seems to be ignorant at that. She proceeded to tell me they got someone last week who started here and the new employee immediately figured other everything. She also told me I have to be fast. Well I\\u2019ve been here for 2 fuckinf days. Instead of telling me about someone else\\u2019s progreses how about you help me? Like everyone is different. Who even approaches something like that to a new employee? \\n\\nOn my first day I did have the luck of meeting a nice coworker who actually let me do my first sandwich and didn\\u2019t rush me or shove out the way. They let me do things at my own pace, press the presets on my own and learn, he was very sweet and gave me a ride home. I feel like I should ignore this but I won\\u2019t learn anything. I guess I have to teach myself? I just did an order with a guy who wanted a BLT with a lot of add ons and I was trying to communicate with her but she was doing her own thing. I apologized to the customer explaining I\\u2019m new. I feel like I have to say that to everyone. I didn\\u2019t want to dread this job ugh. She talks to me like i\\u2019m stupid too, i\\u2019m sure everyone knows what that tone is like.

Despite my requests for assistance, she ignores me or treats me condescendingly. I tried addressing the issue, but she's defensive and sassy. It's affecting my performance and morale. I'm considering talking to management, but in the meantime, I'm trying to stay focused and improve.

It has been pure misery. I was depressed/angry/bitter and there were some days I couldnt even get out of bed.  I have nearly a decade of work history, a bachelors degree and an associates degree. Here is a breakdown of what i went through: \\n\\nSent out over 400 applications- Probably had close to 350 totally ghost/ignore them - Of the 50 or so I heard back from,  45 stopped communicating and/or fell into limbo. \\n\\nI would ask questions here on reddit and make venting type posts about how the labor market is tight, only for people to say \\\"You are just lazy, everywhere is hiring\\\" or \\\"You don't want to work\\\" or \\\"You have a useless degree/useless experience\\\" and so on and so forth.   \\n\\n\\nAfter a while, I grew depressed and discouraged and got to the point where I had basically given up on my dreams of a \\\"career\\\" job and was applying for any old job. \\n\\nKeep in mind, these ranged broadly from entry level retail jobs (i was getting very desperate) all the way to mid-high level career type jobs. \\n\\nAll of 2023 was a total bust. I first starting looking for jobs in Sept 2023 and kept getting the run around by bad recruiters, people ghosting me, agencies rejecting me because I didn't fit in, so on and so forth. Heres some of my bad experiences just in the past 2 months or so\\n\\nI had a virtual interview for a beer delivery driver job in Feb. They told me i'd be carrying up to 100 pounds of beer cases a day, repeatedly, between 60 and 100 times a day. Having arthritis, I unfortunately had to decline. Also the pay for this was barely above minimum wage. \\n\\nI had another interview for an ecommerce job with a local company early January. Pay was on the low side, but I had alot of experience in procurement (I was an ebay seller many years), and I was able to answer all the questions easily. Interviewer basically laughed in my face when I told them I was an ebay seller and told me that \\\"he thought ebay had died long ago\\\". needless to say, I was rejected for this position via email a week later. \\n\\nI had an interview around a month ago for the retail-esque sales manager/dept manager job I had for 2 years that I left back in July due to a move across country. In theory, I was the best candidate for the position. They even told me I was the only one interviewed who had done the exact job prior. She told me that I would hear back tomorrow with the decision. I was totally baffled when not only did she not call me, but I got an automated rejection email later that day. \\n\\nBut my single biggest upset was I had an interview with a state agency two weeks ago. This was for a position that was basically exactly what I wanted to do- Directly related to my college major, something I was passionate about, and something I could see myself doing long term. I practiced for the interview for hours, was in close contact with HR, and the day of the interview I was confident i'd nail it. So I went in, and four people were interviewing me, all with the personality of dryer lint.  Needless to say, it was a painful interview. I was devastated leaving because I knew in my gut I didn't get it. \\n\\nEarly this week, I got an e-mail from another state agency that I honestly forgot that I had applied to (well over a  month ago). I figured, why the heck not go, I had nothing better to do. Showed up and immediately connected with the hiring board. Interview went well, I seemed to be generally well liked by this particular panel of interviewers. Walking out, they were very warm and friendly with me and the vibe was totally different. \\n\\nThe next day, I get a call from an  HR department from the state agency offering me the position. The pay was 2x higher than my former job i had that I was turned down from, despite having the experience. I also have a flex spending account and a pension.  The pay is also higher than the other state agency that turned me down two weeks ago. \\n\\nMoral of the story is, I wasn't \\\"About to give up\\\", i basically had already given up. I went to the interview this week mostly because I was bored and had nothing better to do, I was pretty much 99.9% sure I wouldn't get the job. But by simply the fluke of the interviewers liking me for some reason, they offered me the position, despite interviewing over 20 people for the position. \\n\\nSo, the moral of the story and the summary of this entire post is, no it's not you, the job market is a joke right now. People who have had jobs for years have no scope of reference for how bad things are. Labor statistics are being skewed to push agendas. And people are calling people job searching \\\"lazy\\\" and \\\"unmotivated\\\" when \\\"everywhere is hiring\\\". \\n\\nSo don't give up, keep trying, eventually, good things will happen. \"", "title": "The crazy state of the job market in the USA", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bfquhw/the_crazy_state_of_the_job_market_in_the_usa/"}, {"author": "Own-Pin5493", "created_utc": 1710617556.0, "link_flair_template_id": "bc0eba3c-8094-11e6-8775-0e4ea1a0bb0f", "link_flair_text": "Startups", "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1bge3iv", "score": 4, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"\"", "title": "I want to work here: Dark Overlord of Robots Seeks Henchperson For Internet Mind Control", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "url": "http://www.50day.io/SupervillainOnly/TopSecret/Binders/WorldDominationV6/job.pdf"}, {"author": "unusual5268", "created_utc": 1710638928.0, "link_flair_template_id": "6406c11c-86ad-11e6-86c2-0e0536d0c06b", "link_flair_text": "Job searching", "num_comments": 1, "post_id": "1bglo24", "score": 1, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"I have a music degree and will soon have a violin building/repair diploma and I'm realizing there's not enough money in the field.

With my current job, it's only part time, and according to my supervisor there is 'no room for growth' and the 'state doesn't have the budget to make you full time' even thought she and her boss, the director of our department, knew that I wanted to become full time once my one year probation period ended.\\n\\nI'm a quick learner, I know how to de-escalate situations and think quickly on my feet. I work in one of the most hated departments of a community college because we deal with students' money and I have been yelled at, called a bitch, have had things pushed off my desk. I've had to call campus security for a veteran getting in my face and screaming at me because he got an email from my supervisor that we couldn't submit one of his classes to the veteran affairs for certification. I've learned how to take students' previous transcripts and can conduct unofficial evaluations and can know what courses will transfer to our two year institution and which ones won't (had to learn this because students kept asking us \\\"well do you know if I take this course here will my financial aid/VA money pay for it??\\\")\\n\\nI'm tech-savvy, I can handle in-bound and out-bound calls. I manage a central email inbox for all financial aid and military/veteran benefits inquiries. I have seen up to 60 students in one day during the peak of fall enrollment. I can learn new certification software with ease. \\n\\nYet, I can't seem to get a better job anywhere. I make $18 an hour, and can only work 29 hours per week. I need a full time job. HR will not let me work more than 29 hours a week, I've asked. I receive NO benefits, no PTO, no health insurance, nothing. If I take a day off, my supervisor guilts me into \\\"not thinking about the good of the office\\\" or \\\"well since you've taken this day off, you need to make up those hours over the weekend\\\". I've been asked to change my schedule so much to accommodate the other 13 full time employees in the same office/department and I'm the youngest here by a long shot. \\n\\nI have had several interviews. One place I even interviewed for twice, they contacted my references, and I sent out two follow up emails and got the generic 'we went with another candidate' and it crushed me. The other two interviews I've had, I was ghosted after sending a thank you email to the interviewers and just never heard anything back.\\n\\nI've taken my resume to the writing center at my college and had one of the professors look it over and they said it looked like a great resume. I'm tempted to have a second set of eyes look it over just to be sure, or pay someone to write up a really great, stand out resume.\\n\\nI don't think I'm asking for too much here. I just want a full time job, with benefits, and if I can score one that is remote/WFH, then that would be amazing so I don't have to continue paying after school care fees for my daughter. My goal is to be out of this office job before the spring semester ends in May but I've been job hunting since January and nothing has panned out yet. I don't know what I'm going to do because the thought of staying in this toxic environment another year, or longer is sad. I hate waking up and having to go to in an office where I know students can and will abuse me and threaten me and yell at me and since I am the lowest on the totem pole, it'll happen and keep happening because according to my supervisor, my title is 'customer service representative' and I have to deal with any and every student who calls or walks in.\\n\\nJust feeling down and frustrated. I thought I had a genuinely life changing job in the bag and then to get a rejection email just like a kick in the guts and now I'm being anxious and worried when I just want something to go right for me.

I've been working in a warehouse for a little over 4 months now. It's a simple enough job. Gets bills paid and allows me to add a few hundred to savings each week. All I do is pick orders from the aisles of shelves we have and put them on a pallet or on a trolley to take them to the tables where people pack them. Sometimes I just do picking, sometimes both picking and packing. \\n\\nAnother thing is this is the one job where I've had the most coworkers. There's two warehouses with different items right next to each other and I'd estimate about 15-20 people work in the main warehouse and 10-15 in the other warehouse on any given day, so each day I'm bound to interact with a bunch of different people. In previous jobs I had in retail or working in the kitchen I only had a few coworkers. \\n\\nI would say there's 4 coworkers that I feel I'm good with in the sense that we look out for each other and I can feel their sincerity when they greet me, interact with me, etc. With others I notice a difference in how they greet me/interact with me vs. others, some talk about me in their language and laugh while I'm working with them, or if there's a problem with an item that I picked with one other person (most of the week I spend picking bulk orders with another guy - we pick boxes that are a little heavy and stack them on pallets, and usually it's a two person job)  I'm always the one that gets called to fix it. The people who fulfil the orders we pick are close to the other guy I work with so I guess it's easier for them to call me rather than bother him. There was also a recent instance I remember where one guy jokingly told me \\\"charlielovesolives, you're in my way!\\\" as he was going past and just before that he greeted the other guy I work with and did some small talk.\\n\\nTo be honest, I'm an introvert and socially awkward so I think it would be more burdensome for me to be liked and on good terms with more people. It would mean more small talk throughout the day, more people I have to put on a smile for when I greet them and try to give off a positive energy to even when I'm not feeling 100%. But somehow these things that I've described always seem to get to me and sometimes ruin my day or mood, although I try really hard not to let that show. \\n\\nI just need to tough this job out until June and I will reach my savings goal, and even better if I can stick it out till the end of September. But sometimes these instances get to me so much to the point that the thought of quitting gets very tempting. Shame because the job itself is quite possibly the easiest I've had lol. \\n\\nSorry for the long post. Just wanted to get this off my chest and ask for some advice on how I can think about this situation differently and reframe things so that I can stay at this job longer? Has anyone else faced something similar in the workplace? If so, how did you deal with it or how did you get through it?   \\n\\n\\nThanks so much for reading if you got to this point.\"", "title": "How do you deal with feeling left out or treated differently at work?", "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bg3d0c/how_do_you_deal_with_feeling_left_out_or_treated/"}, {"author": "InvestigatorFinal839", "created_utc": 1710599120.0, "link_flair_template_id": "d1f08d62-05ab-11e6-9ea7-0ebb139b9f2d", "link_flair_text": "Applications", "num_comments": 11, "post_id": "1bg792q", "score": 1, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"I worked for basically a month and a half at Buc-ee\\u2019s then was fired for flicking someone off (as a joke) and talking about inappropriate things (smoking weed).

With a string of unlucky jobs, I am currently applying for a new job and I feel like my short time in each position is making my resume look like a red flag for potential new employers. For background, here is a rough timeline:\\n\\n1. Politics, 4 months (contract) - Our office lost our Ministry, which meant all of us in the office lost our jobs with the politician having less responsibilities. \\n2. Politics, 6 months (permanent) - I was told that there is no room for career growth, politician told me that he will gladly help me find a job so I can pay for student loans and bills. 99% of my responsibility was reading and sending emails. \\n3. Non-profit, 6 months (contract) - got offered a managerial position at a non-profit I was volunteering for so I took the opportunity. I enjoyed the many responsibilities and the career growth. However, I quit because of consistent bad experiences (e.g., publicly shaming, publicly blaming, etc.)\\n4. Non-profit, 5 months (current contract) - great office environment and the manager expressed how they would like me to stay on board if our organization is given enough funding. However, contract is ending soon and it is not being renewed because our organization's projects were cut down by 75%, equating to millions in funding. \\n\\nAll of my previous jobs, probably except for (3) even though I left on good terms, would be able to back me up and explain why I was let go due to reasons we cannot control and not for performance issues. I am confident that these references would describe me as someone who has a good work ethic. \\n\\nI would appreciate some insights on how to best approach this. Should I include a part on my resume explaining my short time in these positions? I am also looking into transitioning into the private sector so I was wondering what entry level positions I can get into with my degree. \\n\\nWhile my resume on face value seems to contradict it, I would really just like to stick with one stable job that offers a chance to advance my career. \\n\\nThanks everyone. \"", "title": "4 jobs in ~2 years.

Never got a straight answer.\\nToday I was totally blindsided. My other manager called after work and basically told me \\\"the company is navigating away from Medicare to focus on selling life insurance (a license I dont have.) I'm sorry but we have to cut you. It wasn't your performance, you were great and we loved having you and will miss you.\\\" Literally that was it. The lay off was effective immediately. No warning. No 2 week notice. And all im left with is questions and confusion. They literally told me a week ago how great I am for the company. I'm crushed as I loved this job and can't remember doing anything to make them do this to me. Any advice or comfort would be GREATLY appreciated. I'm sorry the post was so long. \"", "title": "Just got laid off ", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bf5fga/just_got_laid_off/"}, {"author": "notastepfordwife", "created_utc": 1710548768.0, "link_flair_template_id": "dc491ca2-05ab-11e6-97de-0ec36f9f170d", "link_flair_text": "Interviews", "num_comments": 1, "post_id": "1bft280", "score": 1, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"I'm amazing at my job, but I can't be there anymore.

I took a contract job that didn't pay well and kept looking while I was working in January. I was then offered a job at a marketing agency and agreed with the contract job  I could do part time but I had to be in office for the first two weeks at the marketing agency.

I was struggling with a couple clients and understanding their branding - I thought I was doing fine but my director started nitpicking at the smallest edits and felt like down right bullying and harassment. I was still getting used to their system and it was the most unorganized process I have ever witnessed it my life. On top of that they said they were doing a restructuring so everyone's roles were changed. \\n\\nI would see them yell over each other during meetings, and it was just a huge chaotic mess they could only decode. I saw this in about the first two weeks and said nope bye. I kept looking after work hours. By some god-send I was contacted by a recruiter that was offering a role that I had been trying to get into but my previous work titles didn't fit. I took a couple of calls and two interviews and landed my dream job! Plus a cool pay bump.\\n\\nI got the job and was going to tell my employer but they let me go before I could talk to them about it.

I work in Australia. I am a graphic operator. \\n\\nI recieved a phone call from my boss (while at work before my contractually agreed start time funnily enough, doing pre-shift OT) and he asked me if I wanted to do some work on Saturday...\\n\\nI declined the offer due to already having made commitments on Saturday (and Sunday). This is the third week in a row where I've refused doing overtime on a Saturday. \\n\\nMy boss proceeded to develop the conversation and spoke to me about his feelings as a manager and how he finds its disappointing/upsetting that I refuse to do Saturday work or work more overtime than other employees, when we are in a busy period or if someone takes annual leave. \\n\\nNow from an objective point of view, I can legitimately understand how he as a manager can feel it that way.\\n\\nHowever, I responded to his statements talking to him about our daily routine during the working week. My wife and I work different shifts during the working week, my wife works a part time job where her hours are a 7am-12:00pm shift. We also have a child who is 1 years old. So the way our routine works out during the week is I look after our daughter in the morning and when my wife comes home she takes over and I go to work. (For those curious, we cannot afford childcare anymore... Pesky mortgage rate rises & C.O.L rises to thank for that) \\n\\nUsually I leave for work at 1:30pm to make it to my start time of 2:00pm however because it is busy currently I've been doing pre-shift overtime starting as early as I can at between 12:30-1:00pm which means I usually leave as soon as my wife gets home at 12 or at 12:30pm... \\n\\nSo I barely get time to see and spend time with my wife during the week... Which is one of the reasons why weekends are so important to me and another reason why I refused to work the Saturday (or sunday for that matter) I want to spend a bit of time with my wife, actually see her in person and do family things together.\\n\\nHe said after listening to me that he understands that family time is important as he himself has a family too... But still expects me to do more overtime or weekend work as it is unfair that my coworkers (of which might be worth mentioning unlike me get to work from home) do more overtime than me. \\n\\nI proceeded to ask him if we were contractually obligated to do a certain amount of overtime, his response was a not very confident sounding \\\"I think so, I'll have to check and get back to you\\\" \\n\\nI proceeded to research it myself, looking into it my employment is subject to an EBA and in that EBA alot of our employee rights and cited by the \\\"graphics arts award 2000\\\" \\n\\nWhich states (in relevance to overtime), I'll only mention the relevant sections for the sake of this already being an epic...\\n\\n\\\"6.4 OVERTIME\\n\\n6.4.1 Requirement to work reasonable overtime\\n\\n6.4.1(a) subject to clause 6.4.1(b) an employer may require an employee to work reasonable overtime at overtime rates\\n\\n6.4.1(b) an employee may refuse to work overtime in circumstances where the working of such overtime would result in the employee working hours which are unreasonable having regard to: \\n\\n6.4.1(b) (ii) the employees personal circumstances including family responsibilities\\n... \\n\\n6.4.1(b) (v) any other relevant matter\\\" \\n\\nNow I suspect when it comes to the legalities of 'overtime obligations' that despite my not being able to do a large number of overtime per day, I do go out of my way to try and do as much overtime as I possibly can... Which to me comes under the umbrella of \\\"reasonable overtime\\\", which I conclude means I cannot be terminated of my employment because I don't do enough overtime. \\n\\nSo, long statement, I know! \\n\\nBut I am curious of how others view overtime?\\n\\nDo you all feel as an employer/employee that it's an obligation, that it is owed or expected that overtime is done? \\n\\nWhat are your definitions of \\\"Reasonable overtime\\\"? \\n\\nAny other overtime curiosities people want to discuss? \\n\"", "title": "Overtime \"obligations\"", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bf7io8/overtime_obligations/"}, {"author": "RUTHLESS_RAJ", "created_utc": 1710326220.0, "link_flair_template_id": "7f3169f0-3477-11e8-bd00-0e56aa346a78", "link_flair_text": "Work/Life balance", "num_comments": 348, "post_id": "1bdoar9", "score": 2837, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"\"", "title": "What does being loyal get you in all fairness?", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "url": "https://i.redd.it/4leqgt5rx2oc1.png"}, {"author": "aaa11aaa", "created_utc": 1710453501.0, "link_flair_template_id": "6406c11c-86ad-11e6-86c2-0e0536d0c06b", "link_flair_text": "Job searching", "num_comments": 8, "post_id": "1bexaz3", "score": 3, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"I'm interviewing for a job that is described to be very challenging due to frequent turnover.

And it\\u2019s terrible. I\\u2019m 19 year old female and am getting near to completing my first year of college. I decided to get a job to help my parents out, such they are making a lot of sacrifices and borrowing money to help pay for it. At first, they were really saying I needed a job so that they didn\\u2019t need to pay me a weekly allowance. So, I did. This isn\\u2019t my first job, before I worked at two places as summer jobs (about 3-4 months each), an ice rink and a fast food place respectively, and they were really kind and I have good standing with them back home.

Always degrading me saying \\u201clike why are you like this\\u201d or \\u201cI have to explain it because some people are dumb\\u201d or even when she is talking to another coworker, tries to say something \\u201cwell at least you can do this.\\u201d Like of course, I\\u2019m going to make mistakes, I literally just started. With other managers, they seem to baby me to much, so then they wouldn\\u2019t teach me all the necessary things I would need to do for my next shift. The one manager I dislike would just send me home early and say something like \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to teach you because it will take to long.\\u201d So yeah. Of course I feel really dumb. When I have shifts without that one mean manager, I feel a lot better, but I still have a very heavy sense of dread. On top of that, I always get anxiety before work now, I cry before the shifts, don\\u2019t eat the entire day, and skip my classes for the next week sleeping in my bed. I even broke down in front of my parents, which I\\u2019ve never done before. I\\u2019m considering going to a therapist and just getting a note and send that in and just leave. My parents also said that I should just quit, I can hold it out if I want to, but they also said it\\u2019s not worth it if I\\u2019m not learning, the real reason I\\u2019m here. Now I have other things I\\u2019m trying to involved myself in at school to be more social and it\\u2019s just conflicting with work to much, and so now I\\u2019m not getting the days off I need.

I'm Helly, a front-end dev. Job hunting has never been this challenging. It usually took me a week to find a new job, but this time, after two months of searching, I'm still unemployed with disappointingly few interviews. I'm here to ask some frank questions. Your advice and opinions are greatly appreciated!\\n\\n**A brief context:** My primary expertise lies in React (6+ years), TypeScript (3+ years), and Svelte (3+ years). I have experience with data visualization libraries and Vanilla, comfortable working in a team (with sprints, code reviews, and other Blackjack) and solo. I've also dabbled in business logic analysis and UI/UX design. English level B2, Master's Degree in applied math and physics. I'm seeking for a full-time remote position as a frontend developer, preferably (but not necessary) for a long-term commitment.\\n\\nI'm having difficulty finding a job due to some weaknesses in my CV and I don't know what to do.\\n\\n* The main obstacle appears to be **a one-year gap in my main specialty**, which I believe is the primary reason for the lack of interviews. Things were going well until a year of self-employed work popped up at the top of my CV.Let me share how it happened. Five years ago, I worked as a frontend dev, but I always had a passion for writing 'logic' (though I love frontend, I craved more). As a hobby, I began drafting simple game ideas using JS libraries. After several attempts and a few years later, I developed the basic logic for my first non-draft game (not a JS based engine).  \\nWhen the war broke out, I left my home country and found a job in Armenia, worked there for 8 months. Although the job was financially rewarding, it came with stress, and simultaneously, I faced personal challenges. Feeling depressed and scared, I decided to quit my job to fullfill my own project, thinking it was my last chance. Now, I realize it was a mistake\\u2014the worst possible moment and the most stupid way for such an experiment. But once it's done, I must figure out how to fix my career.  \\n**Question #1:** If you were in my shoes, would you consider stating on your CV that you continued working with the same company last year instead of coding your game? It's challenging for me to lie about my job, but I'm weighing all options. Alternatively, is it better to omit any mention of the past year?  \\n**Question #2:** To HR professionals reading this, I'd appreciate your opinion. Is this considered a red flag? If so, why? Could there be a misconception that I took a break, perhaps due to family planning (which is not the case)? Or does it imply to you that I've forgotten my main specialty?  \\nI disagree with the assumption that my skills in my main specialty have diminished. On the contrary, I gained a deeper understanding of code organization, clarified programming concepts, and did not forget React. I encountered minor syntax challenges first, such as using a Python-like \\u201c:\\u201d to open a function body instead of JS \\u201c{\\u201d. However, I fixed it in a few days practicing JS problem-solving. More of that in my actual coding, I use GitHub Copilot, it efficiently manages such things. I was told it\\u2019s a good idea to use \\u201cnew\\u201d technologies, isn\\u2019t it?  \\nTo be honest, I was surprised. In most of my previous workplaces, anyone with their own project, even if it wasn't completed, gained extra \\u201crespect points\\u201d. Not necessarily because the project was revolutionary, cool, or useful, but because it signified two things: 1) a true passion for programming, providing extra motivation, and 2) the ability to self-organize and make significant progress on interesting tasks. I did not expect the red carpet but couldn't have imagined that a year of developing my own project would have such a negative impact on my CV.  \\n**Question #3:** For Frontend team leads or those involved in hiring, I'm curious: is it viewed positively or negatively if a candidate has a personal project written in a language different from the primary coding language? Does it convey anything meaningful to you?  \\n\\n* Next weakness is **short duration of my experience at one place** (maximum 1.5 years). Sometimes, I chose to work for smaller companies because they often offered better conditions. But also, they have a tendency to close more frequently. Additionally, it was sometimes psychologically easier to negotiate a better salary at a new job than within an existing position. Some of my roles were project-based. In fact, I've only left the last employer I mentioned impulsively. In my defense, I waited to leave until the product was released and bugs were fixed. I value completing tasks, even if it takes time.  \\n\\n* My **citizenship of a country subjected to a large amount of sanctions** is also causing trouble, making it challenging to find a job in the EU through LinkedIn. I've received several rejections citing reasons like \\\"we can't hire from your region.\\\" My previous job was with an Armenian company that develops and supports web services for a notable American brand. Since then, I've maintained USD and EURO bank accounts in Armenia. While I'm prepared to permanently relocate from my native country (currently facing financial constraints forcing me to stay), I've mentioned some of this in my cover letters. Additionally, I'm open to receiving payment in BTC.  \\n**Question #4:** I'm keeping up with global events, and I grasp the legal and tax restrictions in the employer's country, but I keep hearing about people from my country finding jobs overseas quite frequently. So, is it possible to hire someone living in another country (or outside the EU, like Armenia or Sri Lanka), despite having unfavorable citizenship? And what about getting paid in BTC? I'd like answers to these questions for both the EU and the US.  \\n\\n\\n**My salary expectations:**\\n\\nBased on my previous frontend work experience, I'm looking at around $3000 per month (net). It's a starting point for discussion and can vary depending on the specifics.\\n\\n**Question #5:** $3000 per month is considered a modest salary in the US. What about the EU? What's the typical price range for mid-senior remote frontend developers?\\n\\nI'm asking because I've seen junior frontend positions advertised for $2000 per month, so I assume $3000 per month for mid-senior roles isn't too much. For now, my CV doesn't include specific salary expectations to avoid potentially scaring off potential employers (or not to ask too little?)\\n\\n**Question #6:** Technically, at my last job, my employer's business model involved selling my work hours to a US company, with a significant portion of the income derived from the difference between salaries in my region and those in the US for the same job. And it's totally OK (employer did a lot, I know), but I wonder if there are EU or US companies that can (at least physically) hire me remotely and pay in one of the mentioned ways. If my work hours come at a lower cost, wouldn't it be beneficial for both the employer and me? Maybe I should consider other countries in order to get such a job?\\n\\nThanks for reading all of that!

But I did not ask the recruiter about it because I did not want to \\u201csend them\\u201d a red flag. We talk about the position for a while and then I agree to go in for an interview with the company.\\n\\nThere, at the interview the hiring manager also did not mention a drug test. We talked for a while about the specifics of the job and then I accepted the offer. After that they give me this online form that I needed to fill out, which only allowed me to view one page at a time, review it and then sign at the bottom. Then it would let me go to the next page.\\n\\nAt the very end of this very long, 40+ pages of reading and signing things, at the end it has the drug test form. I was super ticked off that they never mentioned this to me in the beginning. Only at the very end where I had spent hours of my time. Signing and reading those documents took hours. Talking to the recruiter and then driving in for the interview were also multiple additional hours that I spent.\\n\\nThe document about the drug test mentioned that I would have 30 days to complete it. I also needed the money at the time, so I thought\\u2026 hmm, I think I will just ride this out and delay the drug test for the entire 30 days so I at least have a job for a month.\\n\\nI get there on my first day of work and right from the beginning I see a number of red flags that they don\\u2019t give a squat about me there. Firstly, they were not prepared on the first day to sign me in and give me my badge. I had to sit in a chair for 30 minutes or so before they were ready.\\n\\nWhen I get to my work area, I notice how run-down all the chairs are there. They look like they are 10 year old chairs that people have been sitting in all day, and I had to sit in that uncomfortable thing for 8 hours, 5 days per week. One time they ran out of those crappy chairs and gave me something worse\\u2026 a wooden one. The other ones at least had a beat-up cushion.\\n\\nI never heard the words \\u201cgood job\\u201d there, very little motivation other than to tell me that I needed to work faster. As they said to me, something along these lines: \\u201cThis is a factory, one of the most important things here is numbers.\\u201d \\u201cYou will be graded upon how fast that you can process the samples.\\u201d\\n\\nI played the game of delaying the drug test until the 30 days were up. I drive into work, hoping I can make an excuse about it and get it delayed for another week. I figure at a minimum I\\u2019ll be able to complete my shift that day and I\\u2019ll be fired.\\n\\nI was not expecting, but also not incredibly surprised at how rude they were that day. A couple minutes after I sit down at my work station, one of the bosses comes in along with a security guard. They matter of factly say for me to pack up my stuff and get off the property. I ask them why. They did not even have the common decency to tell my why I was fired or sit down and have a chat with me. They don\\u2019t thank me for the work I did, nothing, they gave me the boot.\"", "title": "Surprise Drug Test Requirement", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1beshpl/surprise_drug_test_requirement/"}, {"author": "Walkend", "created_utc": 1710427542.0, "link_flair_template_id": "fb0590aa-e252-11e2-9a2b-12313b0c8c59", "link_flair_text": "Article", "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1bemvmi", "score": 2, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"\"", "title": "The Productivity\u2013Pay Gap: Productivity has grown 4.4x as much as pay!", "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "url": "https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/"}, {"author": "xArkSlade08x", "created_utc": 1710440996.0, "link_flair_template_id": "6406c11c-86ad-11e6-86c2-0e0536d0c06b", "link_flair_text": "Job searching", "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "1bes8gq", "score": 1, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"I'm curious if anyone knows what other independent jobs, independent Dasher apps, and independent delivery drivers apps that are available at or near by this locations in Augusta County, Stuarts Draft, Waynesboro, Staunton, Fishersville. \"", "title": "What other Dasher/Delivery apps and Independent jobs are available at or near by Augusta County, VA?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bes8gq/what_other_dasherdelivery_apps_and_independent/"}, {"author": "saltyBQ", "created_utc": 1710374273.0, "link_flair_template_id": "f95f85fa-05ac-11e6-8dae-0ec36f9f170d", "link_flair_text": "Office relations", "num_comments": 35, "post_id": "1be71wo", "score": 27, "subreddit": "jobs", "text": "\"I've been temporarily reporting into an executive for the past 6 months and it was decided that they needed to hire a director for our department.

So I'm invited to join the 2nd round interviews. And then it comes out that one of my coworkers applied and they have moved into the second round. \\n\\nThey've only been with the company since July. And in that time, we've had a couple conflicts that did not go over well.

And while hard-skills and technical knowledge are needed in this role, it is primarily a team-leader role. \\n* and finally, I actually don't think they have much in the way of hard-skills or ability/desire to keep improving their skills.

I (28F) have been applying for jobs since the start of 2024. I've been at my current job almost 2 years, and though I enjoy it, I'd been wanting to leave for a few reasons: 1) general fatigue and burnout, 2) a long commute and 3) wanting to make a higher salary. My commute was initially fine but got a lot longer after I moved to the suburbs to live with my partner. Let's call him Jack.\\n\\nA few days ago, I had a third interview with a company I really like. They called me the next day to say they reached out to my references. I know my references are still submitting materials, but I am hoping to have a response soon. When I first started applying, I told myself I'd accept the job if I got an offer, as long as it was higher than my current salary.\\n\\nWell, fast forward a couple days. Jack and I broke up. We'd been having some issues but I still didn't expect things to go the way they did, when they did. I am now staying at a friend's place, and hoping to move somewhere more stable soon. I'm safe but heartbroken and sad and mentally drained. I loved Jack (still do) and it was my longest relationship and first time living with an SO.\\n\\nIn light of my breakup, I've been having second thoughts about this potential new job. My current boss has been very supportive and kind throughout my situation, though he does not know about the interviews. Work has also slowed down for a bit. I am now living closer to the office and plan to get a place within a 30-ish minute drive from work. Also, switching jobs would mean switching insurance, and that feels tricky given some physical & mental health stuff I need to take care of. \\n\\nAlong with all that, I don't know if I have the mental energy to start a whole new job and leave my current one. I know healing takes time, and things will get better, but I really don't know how long this transition will take.\\n\\nWould it be wrong to decline the job offer if I got one? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Would appreciate your insights.

Of course they are going to say everything is fine and dandy. certain media has its favored candidates and reports what their official stance is. \\n2. **federal interest rates:** [BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are 'arguably the most powerful cartel in human history', Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy says.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-state-street-vanguard-arguably-211002034.html) These three companies on a 30% stake in 90% of the S&P 500 companies. It is well known that as long as the board members of the companies they invest in follow their requests, they will not exercise voting rights to replace those board members. [all three have $20 trillion in managed assets](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/giant-conglomerates-control-world-omkar-chitnis/). the debt (and payments of) for those \\\"assets\\\" cut into the returns on investment (dividends). What I would do is have these companies advertise for jobs that they never intend to fill to make the unemployment rate look artificially low, thus the Fed will not raise interest rates. if the fed raises interest rates by .25% (0.0025), then on $1trillion of debt, they owe an additional $2.5 billion overnight.\\n3. **ppp (pandemic) loans:** I do not fully understand the repayment mechanism of these things (I sucked in accounting), but there is a way that if a company cannot fill positions, it qualifies for loan forgiveness. Companies advertise for positions they never intend to fill so they have documentation.\\n4. **grants and other loans:** by appearing to have open positions, a company can appear to be growing. This creates the appearance of need so that they can qualify for different grants and loans.\\n5. **overhearing of 2021:** companies, especially tech companies over hired in 2021. With the slowing economy, we are seeing major layoffs, especially in e-commerce and the tech sector. Many of these companies are hedging their bets, and building applicant pipelines. This is because if the economy starts a miraculous recovery, next year, they are prepared to hire.\\n6. **AI:** companies are over relying on AI. AI is allowing for massive job cuts for people who create content. It is also creeping in to our delivery drivers and livery (taxi) drivers. Again, I believe that companies are hedging their bets and creating applicant pipelines in the event that AI does not deliver what was promised.\\n7. **Data collection:** AI is essentially advanced data analysis. It combines machine learning within intuitiveness. It allows for the reading and processing of data and trending/learning how to scale never before seen. The biggest problem is that a handful of companies have the greatest amount of data siloed. (Think google, banks, media, healthcare, etc.) So how does a smaller company compete? The cheapest way to collect data is to have people voluntarily give it. While there is a cost to posting jobs, gathering resumes is one of the cheapest and most efficient ways to compile personal data.\\n8. **make the job site look good:** [just like the dating site Ashley Madison was accused of almost all it's female profiles being fake to attract men willing to pay for the service](https://theweek.com/64457/ashley-madison-nearly-all-female-accounts-were-fake-or-dormant), so too job sites will post jobs that have been filled. This happened to someone that I personally know; she posted a job for her company, when they filled the job she took the posting down. two weeks later, she saw the job reposted. (this could be human error, a glitch, I do not know or want to speculate). \\n9. [**applicant tracking systems suck!**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jameshudson/2024/01/10/why-job-listings-get-reposted-and-why-you-should-apply-to-them-anyway/?sh=67f31c3c67c1) we all know this. it has been suggests that ATS places too much emphasis on keywords and fails to take into account a candidate's skills, experience, or qualifications. As a result, many qualified candidates are overlooked .[SHRM reported: Some AI-based systems may be increasing the worker shortages they were built to address.](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/hr-magazine/applicant-tracking-system-hurting-recruiting-efforts)\\n10. **good old fashioned scams:** a good number of job postings are just outright scams.

Being fired for cause is a serious matter that should not be taken lightly, and it should serve as a permanent mark on one's record. Here's why I believe this:\\n\\n**Permanent Mark on Record:** Being fired for cause or marked as \\\"ineligible for rehire\\\" should follow you for the rest of your life and be treated the same as a felony conviction. This is a serious consequence that should make individuals think twice before engaging in misconduct or inappropriate behavior in the workplace.\\n\\n**No Excuses for Misconduct:** Regardless of whether you feel your supervisor targeted you or if you believe there were mitigating circumstances, being fired for cause is shameful and should be treated as such. Excuses do not change the fact that serious misconduct occurred. The ONLY exception here is **if you were laid off for purely financial reasons**, in which case that's not a \\\"for-cause\\\" termination & you'd likely be eligible for rehire.\\n\\n**Equal Consequences for All:** Just like how a dishonorable discharge in the military is equivalent to a felony, being terminated for cause should have serious, lifelong consequences. This applies to all forms of misconduct, including but not limited to sexual harassment.\\n\\n**Public Registry:** Those who are terminated for cause or marked as \\\"ineligible for rehire\\\" should be placed on a publicly-accessible registry, similar to how the sex offender registry currently operates. This information can be used by prospective employers, friends, and family to make informed decisions about associating with the individual.\\n\\n**Loss of Rights:** Individuals who are terminated for cause should lose their right to vote and bear arms, similar to the consequences of a felony conviction. They should also lose the right to both Federal and private employment, as well as recourse to any form of welfare or charity.\\n\\nAs only the opinion of the employer matters here, there would be absolutely no right of appeal for these consequences once the employee has lost their job, no matter the circumstances.\\n\\nBy implementing these consequences, we can ensure that individuals think twice before engaging in misconduct in the workplace and that those who do face appropriate lifelong consequences for their actions.

For the last two years of my degree, and since graduating, I have had the same job. I was a psychology student, and I work for a psychologist who runs a reading programme for children with ADHD and dyslexia, delivering the programme to children remotely. \\n\\nThis has been an incredibly part-time job, and I only work anywhere from 3-8 hours a week. Once a month, myself and two others who have the same job as me have a supervision meeting with our boss, where we give updates on the progress of the children we teach. Personal circumstances interrupted my job search as my degree was finishing and meant I wound up moving home after university. Naturally, this very irregular job is limiting my income and I'm at a point now where I'm able and need to find full-time work, so in the last month or so I have become a lot more serious in my job search. \\n\\nIt has, however, become abundantly clear that my boss just does not like me, and this has been picked up on by my colleagues. Last month, I wound up missing our supervision for the month unexpectedly as my mother had fallen unconscious and needed help. I wasn't able to communicate this until the meeting had concluded. I apologised for my lack of attendance as soon as I was able, said it was due to a family emergency, and offered to communicate my important updates over message. I received a reply telling me that missing supervisions was becoming a bad habit of mine, that I often give a variety of reasons for this, and that, bluntly, it was not acceptable. I apologised in a diplomatic way, not wanting to rock the boat, and received no response. But this is simply not true. The last supervision I missed was in November 2022 at a point the meetings were biweekly, and it was due to a university engagement that also meant another one of my colleagues couldn't attend. \\n\\nToday we had another meeting. The topic shifted into ways I can make content more engaging for a child who struggles with motivation, and my boss asked my colleagues for their thoughts. I listened, thanked them for their ideas, and added some context essentially saying I've tried X approach before, will implement their ideas, and acknowledged that this child generally struggles with staying engaged so I'm keen to keep things fresh using a mix of tried and tested and newer ideas. My boss immediately intervened, saying she felt I wasn't engaging with or appreciating the contributions of my peers and that I was acting like I had resigned to the child's temperament and wasn't seeing it as a responsibility of my own. I apologised that my words had come across this way, thanked my colleagues again, and reiterated that I was just trying to give context I thought may be helpful. This was brushed off, I was told that we'd spent enough of the meeting talking about my updates, and we moved on. My colleagues immediately messaged me after the meeting in awe of what happened, that they didn't agree with what she'd said, and joked that she hates me. \\n\\nI feel a little damned if I do, damned if I don't - in hindsight, I think I should have been more concise and swift in acknowledging the ideas and not said anything else. However, I am hyperaware that I am not in good graces and find myself feeling the need to overcompensate by providing explanations and a lot of detail. I realise that I have just wound up digging myself a hole, where my desire to show eagerness is coming across more as defensiveness. \\n\\nI feel awkward broaching the topic of references knowing I have caught her at a time where she doesn't seem happy with me and I feel as though I can't do anything right. It's as though she's already made up her mind that I am flaky and I realise now my communication style isn't particularly compatible with her own. \\n\\nMy boss doesn't have any interaction with me during the rest of the month as I deliver my work and coordinate my own schedule independently, so I was considering using one of my colleagues as a reference to mitigate the potential that the reference won't be good.

I can't even take the car because it's \\\"his car\\\" not mine and haven't been able to get one on my own because \\\"there's no need for you to have your own car if you can share ours\\\". I feel so stuck and shaken that they treat me like it's my fault I'm not landing a job yet. I mean I get I can always do better, but it's not like I haven't gotten a job due to lack of trying.

We all know each other well but are very overworked due to being the bare minimum staff for our service. We are often asked to cover shifts for other colleagues when they are ill or away on holiday and as the most recent addition to the team I'm always getting the bad end of the stick (they call me first, always) and the wages offered are the minimum that they can provide as I joined without experience.\\n\\nNow that I have some experience in the job, I'm looking to apply to a more serious and established company. The one that has an opening for my same position has been in business close to 50 years and they have 40+ employees. I am very interested in applying for this position but I'm concerned about a few things:\\n\\nWill the new company be in contact with my current workplace? As a direct competitor, it concerns me a lot that my current workplace would find out I'm looking to move elsewhere as I fear that could lead to my current job situation worsening, if I were to not get the new job and they find out that I'm looking to leave. Ideally I would rather they don't find out until I've accepted the new job. If I don't get the new job, I wasn't planning to tell anyone at my current job that I'm applying elsewhere but I'm worried they could find out through other means. Like I'm saying, our companies are in direct competition. \\n\\nI am expecting the new job to pay better than my current one, especially now that I have the experience to prove (something I didn't have when I joined my current company). How should I go about this process?\\n\\nMy idea is as follows:\\n\\n1. Apply to the new company, potentially have an interview, without telling my current company.\\n\\n2. A) They don't accept me. I continue working my current job until something else appears.\\n\\n2. B) They accept me. Then I will have to return to my previous job and hand in my notice. I would hope that my current company would be willing to give me a counter offer, as I'm saying we are very understaffed and I believe me leaving would be a huge detriment to my company.\\n\\nDo I even listen to any counter offers? I think my work situation would improve a lot in the new company.\\n\\nI don't really know what I should do. It's a big decision for me. I can be at my current job for 30 years if I wanted to, with the new job, I have no idea. I do know that this position has opened up twice in the last year (one last September, again now in March) which is concerning me about their worker turnaround.\\n\\nSorry for the long wall of text and I'd appreciate any advice.
