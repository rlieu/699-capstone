I have no idea how they connected us through the university, as I wasn\u2019t even in her program. \nI understand the cursory google search of potential candidates, but to be so invested in my mother, is beyond my comprehension.

I had 10 interviews throughout the remainder of 2023 and almost got hired again, but they pulled out last minute when the person reviewing my application saw I was fired, even though we discussed it in the interview (different person doing the review.) \n\nSince March 2023, I have only been employed for a 3 month contract and moved back to my home state. I have been trying since November to find a job closer to my field with no luck. Recently, I started trying to find literally any job. I thought I had a job as an Amazon driver, but I was rejected because I got two tickets in the last year (the only 2 tickets I've ever had.) I had an interview today for a warehouse job, but I thought I was told on the phone they'd offer it to me if the interview went well, and then all they said was \"we'll be in touch, check your email.\" The interviewer's body language also was also seemingly not interested, which gives me a bad outlook. I don't technically know yet, but I don't have any hopes it'll work out. \n\nI have bills to pay, I don't have a place to live, (I live with my cousin and aunt) and nobody around me understands that I literally cannot find a job. (My cousin thinks I must be doing something wrong in interviews or something, but he's a lawyer and hasn't had to find a job since he was in highschool, outside of his current one. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, but things just aren't working no matter what I do.) I don't know what to do. I have $10k in debt just from moving to and from the job I lost, and I have no way to pay it. \n\nI hate my life, I wish I had never moved, I wish I had a different education or just none at all. I ruined my life, I hate my life, and there is literally nothing I can do about it. My life hasn't improved at all over the past year, it's only getting worse and there's no end in sight. Forget getting back to my dream job, I can't even get hired doing nothing.\n\nEdit: Since so many asked, I got fired from a forensic scientist job. It was my fault, but I also feel like my leadership left me out to dry. My chances at getting another one are slim at this point because they don't want me to be a liability to them. I'm still trying, but I am also trying to find something lab based/adjacent, so that maybe I can prove that I can be trusted in a similar field.\n\nEdit 2: I don't bring up that I was fired in regular interviews unless directly asked. I am still applying for the forensic field in addition, in hopes my dreams aren't over, but I cannot lie there. Governments do extensive background checks and the worst thing you can be to them is a liar.\n\nEdit 3: Law enforcement related positions often require a polygraph exam after you provide background information about yourself, often times directly asking if you were ever fired. I know it's dumb, I don't control it. I, personally, am not a good enough liar to beat a polygraph exam. If it gets to that point, I have to disclose it. I am not really concerned with what they find in a database. I know this is Reddit and \"polygraphs bullshit\" and all that. You act like I have any say in the matter. I can refuse, but then I just will simply be dropped from contention.\n\nEdit 4 (Last edit:) For those who don't know or aren't reading, we literally had a routine ethics meeting (prior to me being fired,) where we discussed someone who got fired for lying on her application. She said she had taken a required class when she hadn't. She got an interview, disclosed she hadn't taken the class, but said she would. She was hired, took the class, then someone else found out and fired her because she misrepresented herself on her application. In this field of work, I cannot lie. As stated before, I don't volunteer the information, but I am not going to lie if I am directly asked because it can and very well might come back to bite me. It is worse to lie about it. For non-industry jobs, I haven't mentioned it at all and I will look into a different excuse for those places, if I am asked in the future. \n\nThank you for all your replies, I can't get to everyone, but I have tried to share information where I can. I know I'll be ok in the end, it's just been really hard and I reached a bit of a breaking point yesterday.

Moved up the ranks and became a Design Manager with a raise at 65k, about 10k below market average. The company culture is not great, the Csuite has very high expectations on tight deadlines, with very small teams and are very slow to higher more help. My boss micromanages me and I basically don\u2019t really get to manage my department. This job is also an hour commute from my home. I\u2019ve worked very long hours for 2 years and it has worn on my soul. \n\nI said enough is enough and started looking for jobs. Landed a very good one, and it\u2019s an opportunity to work with architecture related design which I\u2019m hoping to go back to school in the fall. However it\u2019s a small 5k cut, but they said they see my quality of work, want to get me acclimated and want to reevaluate my position and salary in 6 months. Plus this company is 7 min from my home. \n\nI announced my resignation today at my current company. The CEO wanted to meet with me and he expressed how much he loves my work and admires my leadership style. \n\nHe also countered with a 20k raise. 85k would be my new salary. More money than I have ever made in my life by a LONG SHOT. \n\nHowever very little might be done about my work life balance and having the ability to work from home more than one day. I saw my boss meeting with the CEO to discuss this, trying to infiltrate the discussions between myself and the CEO. \n\nSorry for the novel, but all of these details are important to understand this predicament. \n\nTLDR: I\u2019m down to these choices: \n\n1. a TON more money but marginal improvement to work life balance, and a long commute and possibly a pissed off boss but a supportive CEO. \n\n2. A little less money, better work culture, short commute, and huge improvement to work life balance. \n\nWhat would you recommend/what would you choose? \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for your feedback and I have a few things that could answer some questions and provide further details. \n\n1. Can I leverage current company\u2019s offer with new company? No. They expressed to me since it\u2019s an entry level position, it\u2019s a hard cap on 60k. \n\n2. Could I leverage a better work schedule? I tried! I met with him later today and put all my cards on the table, why I was leaving, what I would want in addition the raise to keep me here: His response: \u201clet\u2019s work on getting more PTO awarded for you and your team. If deadlines get too crazy, take time for yourself and recover.\u201d As far as reporting to micromanagy boss, yeah I\u2019d still report to him but the CEO is open to having monthly meetings with just me to deliver reports, pitch ideas, etc. He was firm about adding WFH days, it was a no since it\u2019s a company wide policy that we get ONE day, and individual concessions would cause chaos. I can understand that for sure. \n\n3. Are they just now recognizing my contribution because I\u2019m leaving? Not really, I don\u2019t mean to brag but the company loves me. They\u2019ve always expressed their admiration and gratitude to me, it\u2019s just the salary increase has taken too long and too little. \n\n4. Are they just now giving me a raise because I\u2019m leaving? No, I\u2019ve gotten 2 raises in the past, very small marginal ones\u2026 this will be a third raise and by far the biggest jump. I started working for peanuts as a little designer, and I\u2019ve really climbed and grown. \n\nAlso I talked to my friend in architecture and she said that the work I\u2019d be doing at new company would just be a marginal improvement to the portfolio. So huge edit from before, for long long term of architecture\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t make that big of a difference. \n\nThank you again for your input, I need to make a decision TOMORROW \ud83d\udc80 so all your advice is super helpful. \n\nUPDATE: \n\nI took my CEO\u2019s offer of 85k and more PTO awarded to my team. \n\nYes I saw it in writing and my new salary starts March 1! \n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I had almost every single department head and VP approach me and said they have my back. I spoke very plainly about my role to my boss and expressed how I would like to conduct my role moving forward. Adding structure to help with tight deadlines, a polished request process to cushion time between each request. I also asked that I be the one to roll these initiatives out company wide. He agreed. We\u2019ll see if he actually honors that, but I now know the influence I have here. He doesn\u2019t own me and I have a voice that is effective enough to stand up. \n\nI am going into this assuming nothing will change, though I will try my damndest. I think 85k padding my wallet helps a TON with compartmentalizing some of the ridiculousness and my boss now has seen how the ENTIRE company rallied behind me and knows I can\u2019t be fucked with and my boundaries are firm. \n\nWell what if they fire me in 6 months\u2026 big deal, I\u2019ll have 12,000 more in my bank than I had before. Plus severance/unemployment. \n\nWhat if nothing changes and it gets WORSE? Then I quit. If anything this has taught me is that I\u2019m really capable in my career and maybe was shortchanging myself on what I thought I could earn and what my role could be at another company. I have a banging portfolio, there\u2019s only money to gain now. I live in a state where the economy hitting the shitter has historically effected the job market little. \n\nI\u2019m very young in my career, and if I can get the money NOW to save up for future endeavors\u2026 that to me is worth it. \n\nWe will see how this shapes out, if you\u2019re interested I\u2019ll update again in 3 months. \n\nBut thank you a TON for your input. I really looked at every comment and this helped in my contemplation as well as reaching out to friends and family. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t exactly feel like the \u201cright choice\u201d but does feel like the smart choice, even if for a little while. \n\nWe\u2019ll see, I truly didn\u2019t envision my entire life being here at this company. But by the end of the year, if I survive, I might have enough to go to school full time without having to work\u2026 at all, and that sounds like it\u2019s worth dealing with some shit that EVERYONE in corporate America deals with. \n\nThank you again, and I wish you all great success in your careers! \n", "title": "Quit my Job, CEO countered with a huge amount to make me stay.

Other than sending a follow up what else do you want me to do? They seriously aren't considering that the job market sucks because they didn't once bring up that it's tough out there right now. They are driving me nuts I wish they'd just leave me the hell alone about my job process it makes me feel like not landing a job is somehow my fault. \n\nEDIT: Wow thank you all for the kind responses. I've been reading everyone's replies as they come in. I do hope for all of us that are looking for work are able to find jobs. I'll just keep applying and doing my thing if it doesn't satisfy my parents oh well.

The ROI for bootlicking is a lot higher than it is for, say, your average retail drone.\n\nI suspect this is also why these same types of people didn't seem to have any problems with extended lockdowns.
