I asked him a simple question about a work order he ignored me and walked off as he walked off he told me to fuck off and die.

I believe it\\u2019s because I\\u2019m a women in a construction type field. \\n\\nA month goes by before Hr reaches out to me about the situation and a few other things. she asks me if I\\u2019m out to get Tim fired, if I stole something from a local hardware store, if I drew a multiple peniss around the office on sticky notes, if I brought a dick shaped candle to work for my supervisors birthday, and if I have been sexually harassed. \\n\\n*our work shop was very laid back, in the supervisors office multiple people  from different departments drew a dick on a sticky note and hid the drawing in the office. It was a game. I only drew one. Secondly I did bring the dick candle to work initially,but not for my supervisors bday for another coworkers birthday months before his.

She asked about the sexual harassment I received from work,(to whom I told no one about) and I told her the story of the incident involving another coworker Dave. I was told at the end of the meeting that I would be given a letter of reprimand for my actions toward the vulgar drawings.

It came down Dave and Tim where the two people who spread this all around campus. I have recording of Dave admitting this. Apparently Tim went and had coffee with HR one morning and Dave was painting a house for another lady in HR.\\n\\nNext day since the sexual harassment thing came up in the HR meeting ,now title nine  HR people wanted to meet with me about the sexual harassment. I didn\\u2019t want to report anyone just because of all the other harassment I was already receiving from Dave and Tim. They still wanted to know what happened. Me and Tim were walking to our vehicles at the end of the day, I was walking slightly ahead and I noticed in the corner of my eye, he was staring at my butt. I turned around instantly told him to stop staring at my ass and fuck off, he just smirked. To which I walked backwards all the way to my truck due to how uncomfortable he made me feel. The next day he was working in the shop and I was walking out to get something,he yells \\u201cquit looking at my butt\\u201d (I wasn\\u2019t). He tried to flip the situation on me.

He recommended I should report Dave with title nine and make sure I have a paper trail. So the next day( Thursday) I go back to title nine HR and say I want to report it. They ask the same questions about what happened and then hassle me on why I want to report him all of a sudden.  I say I want a paper trail and that he\\u2019s done it more then once that he will do it again, I feel uncomfortable working around him but I tolerate his presence and try not to start anything. \\n\\nNext Monday I get a letter from title nine saying my claim has been looked over and denied stating\\u201d I was out to get him fired\\u201d.

She started in November as temporary but was made permanent by her supervisor, Mario. Mario began sexually harassing her in the beginning by texting and calling her outside of work, asking personal questions about her dating life, telling her she makes him feel a certain way, interrupts her at work to order her around if she happens to be talking to another male coworker, etc (and she works with a lot of men so she can't do her job without talking to them.) \\n\\nKevin is the boss she originally filed the SH complaint with about 2 months ago, which never made its way to HR but did make it's way to someone in Admin at the main office, Jackie. Jackie said they don't have actual HR in the building. They reprimanded Mario by telling him he can only communicate with Lauren via the company app, not via text or phone calls. \\n\\nHowever, since Lauren filed the sexual harrassment complaint, she has been dealing with a completely hostile work place. For one, Mario fired Lauren's brother the DAY AFTER she filed the complaint. Her brother had been with the company for years and was the one who brought her on board in the first place.\\n\\nMario's boss is ALSO his girlfriend/partner/wife, which everyone in the office knows but the two of them deny. Let's call her Sandra. Since Lauren filed the complaint, Sandra has been the extremely hostile toward her, bumping into her on purpose, getting in her face with attitude all the time (example: \\\"what are you looking at?!\\\" every time she just happens to look up when Sandra is there, yelling at her over nothing, making up reasons to reprimand her). Sandra won't even communicate to Lauren the essential things she needs to know for her job when Lauren asks for instructions or details on a project. Lauren has been trying to keep to herself but Sandra is making the environment hostile for her and everyone else in the workplace.\\n\\nThen TODAY Mario brought up a list of \\\"performance issues\\\" of Lauren's to their higher boss, Kevin. She was told she has a week to correct her performance. Lauren let Kevin know that Sandra and Mario have made her workplace hostile and are purposely getting in the way of her performance. Kevin just asked her \\\"what do you want me to do about it?\\\" Lauren said she just wants to work in peace and be able to do her job because she can't do her work in this environment. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Mario has been going around telling all of the guys that she filed the complaint, that she's a B---, and that he's gonna fire her a--.  Her coworkers have seen the hostility and are also uncomfortable but they are afraid of speaking up because they don't want to get fired or retaliated against either. \\n\\nLauren is a single mom, she works hard, she's going through a divorce with no childcare help from her ex, and she really needs the job.

Last summer, I was promoted in a unionized workplace for a managing job which takes place only during the summer. Long story short, due to how the collective bargaining agreement is designed, there are no measures by which we are technically guaranteed to be hired again summer after summer. For such a thing, we would have to work a certain number of hours in a period of 12 months, which is impossible for a summer job. Until this year however, there was a specific way of recalling employees by HR and upper management which went something like this: once you work a full summer as a manager, the next summer you will be guaranteed to keep your spot. If, however, next summer you refuse to occupy the job and management has to hire someone else, then you lose your priority and it will go to the new candidate. Obviously, if before the summer after your refusal, a spot pops up, then you were allowed to reclaim your old job before management hires someone else. As you can probably guess by now, I was promoted to this managing job last year and expected to have a guaranteed spot this summer.\\n\\n  \\nHowever, there were large changes to the employees working in HR this year and they've apparently decided to change the way they do things. They want to make it so the managing jobs are given by seniority. I would thus lose my promotion to manager if an ex-manager (of 2-3 years ago, for instance) decided to come back this summer and take my job, despite not having worked there for years. To be clear, there is nothing in the collective bargaining agreement that gives the old senior employees priority over me, but there is also technically nothing in there that gives me priority over them. Only common sense tells them that.  \\nIt's insane to me that, in a unionized workplace, I will never have work security as I will always be afraid a more senior employee who occupied the managing job years ago may decide to come take back my job.  \\nAny advice as to how I should handle this?  \\nThanks in advance!\"", "title": "[CAN] Can I lose my promotion over this arbitrary decision?", "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1bezhvo/can_can_i_lose_my_promotion_over_this_arbitrary/"}, {"author": "altruistic-shark", "created_utc": 1710484616.0, "num_comments": 3, "post_id": "1bf7m0f", "score": 0, "subreddit": null, "text": "\"As title says, I failed a urine test for a job I was applying for after getting sober in early January.

Three of the older gen people from my family (it\\u2019s a big family)along with at least four other people from this same  company grew FIELDS worth of the green stuff when I was a kid.  How do I know? I freaking saw it. I went there a lot with them and I didn\\u2019t know really what was going on but as an older person I know now.  Also have other family members who have since confirmed this.  They smoked all the time while going to work for this company.  Not to mention drank crazy amounts to the point of sometimes being violent towards other family members.  Including me.  Weed was a coping mechanism for me for a long time after I got older.  \\n\\nFast forward to now, and my chances of moving on to a legit jo seem slim now.  Even after I\\u2019ve worked on the  sobriety battle and continuing to remain sober.  I\\u2019m being punished more than the generation before me in the EXACT  same large company.  And I actually meet more qualifications than they did when they started.  I\\u2019m big mad, but also understanding messed up smoking for so long.  \\n\\n I disclosed to HR my situation of quitting, but I guess that honesty doesn\\u2019t matter.  They asked for therapy notes that talk about this experience (not the older family members but about leaving a bad relationship and getting sober part)  and I gave the paperwork to them.  Still big no.  \\n\\nI\\u2019m taking care of my health. I got my BMI down to normal levels.   I am willing to show up and I want a solid job I can work for the next decade or two, three??!  I\\u2019m trying!!!  It seems, more than those family members could say even now.  \\n\\nBut yet, I\\u2019m being punished for my past.  Sure, I get it, I\\u2019m still pretty fresh at sobriety. But, I actually quit alcohol a long time before.  It blows my mind that these other people I watched get away with everything and here I  am literally trying to be better.  Grrrrr.  \\n\\nThe difference between generations is wild to me.  These people are the same ones that say things like, \\u201cget a real job\\u201d and \\u201c people don\\u2019t want to work anymore\\u201d \\n\\n I do!!  Very much so! \\n\\nAnyway, if I had  weed show up on a drug test earlier this month and I want to apply for other jobs, who is going to see the results of this test?  And how long am I going to be punished for my past?  The testing Dr. said if I had a CDL or something like that,  I would be reprimanded.  I don\\u2019t have a CDL. But what type of jobs can see this test result?  \\nI really want to move  forward and get my toxic past behind me.  I\\u2019m really enjoying being sober.  But this is all heartbreaking and sometimes it makes me completely doubt the system.  \\n\\nAny advice from experienced HR would be appreciated.  Thank you.  \\n\\nSide info that might be helpful- I usually work trades etc.  and I was hoping to find a reputable company to work for.  But, I\\u2019m embarrassed now and I\\u2019m scared to apply because more and more companies are testing now.  Especially, for the better positions other than just grunt labor work.  \"", "title": "[MT] generational rant with drug test question.

There's alot of context I didn't want to leave out.\\n\\nI have had a difficult time with jobs in the past. I have cognative disabilities those sometimes reflect in a place I have to stay in 40 hours a week to eat. \\nAnyway, I'm at a new place and the manager that hired me left 3 months into hiring me. I was very open with her and she was extremely understanding and accommodating. Her boss, will call her Becky, is the opposite and also the person who took over when she left. She was also aware of my cognative issues as only that, no names and only knew my accomidations. This happened when my manager was sick and I had an appointment during that time and she wanted me to forward the email where I talked to my direct manager about needing the day per my ada accomidations for \\\"cognative disabilities\\\". \\n\\nAfter my manager left her last email informed us to report to a coworker of hers that was taking over a bit of her job and Becky. So when questions or concerns arose I would email both of them, it got to a point that my emails would go unanswered, so I would send them again, then (sometimes a week or more later) I might get a response...sometimes when I did it was obvious my email wasn't read.\\n\\nAlso when my manager hired me she knew I would be going to school and was willing to work with me when the time came. Will get back to that.\\n\\nI got a change of assignment (I work for a kinda internal company pool, I work where the holes are to make sure work is done when people are out) after said manager was gone, she knew where I lived the others did not. My assignment was an hour to an hour and a half away reached out and got a response at the end of the week after I started...after forwarding multiple times and then it was minimized. It was at Christmas and I couldn't afford the extra in gas, they didn't care. At the same time I had issues with my payroll only they could fix that resulted in the company being forced to write me a check because again it was Christmas and I refused to wait til the paycheck the week of the holiday to get it. I had doctor appts, IT issues and at one point a trainee...The manager of the area I was covering caught me mid break down and offered to relocate me to a location closer to home, in my initial email to my direct managers I asked if this would be an option and was told no.\\n\\nI was starting school this spring and with my classes needed to drop to part time, these emails were ignored for two weeks and when I did get a reply is was a congratulations about going to school and didn't address my need to change stats.\\n\\nI found out at the end of December from the same above manager, that I had a new direct manager and that she was hired the beginning of November. I never got an email from Becky or temp manager, I asked for her last name and emailed her to introduce myself. I told her school was starting asap and I would need to cut hours, I also forwarded her the original email from Becky with the congratulations lol She accommodated it, was super apologetic we had a phone meeting and were good. I mentioned working longer hours if need be on the days I could work she said she would ask.\\nEver since my manager left my schedule was a mess, the system wouldn't work and I had the same issue with them not talking to me or minimizing it. New manager, needs a name I guess - Delores,  was informed of this issue twice in January with Becky Cc'd and they never fixed it. My first day back at the assignment I had before the holidays and I was due to start before business hours, which i thought was odd they knew I couldn't get in i had to wait to be let in everyday previously lol I ask when I got there at the normal opening time and the assistant says they didn't understand either, I explained the new school hours and was told \\\"we're not even open so im not sure\\\" I email Delores and cc Becky that hey 7 doesn't work here but I'm able to work after instead, Delores is fine with that. Says she changed it in the schedule, I remind her its not working again (it was never fixed and still at this moment says 7 lol)\\nAt this point school has stated and I'm done trying to get anywhere with any of them if I can't figure something out on my own or by asking the people around me I don't worry about it. \\n\\nBeginning of last month, Delores calls me during class I text her inbetween lessons let her know I don't have time to call but asked what was up. She wanted to know if I was suppose to be at my current assignment for the next month. Which I thought was odd at first anyway, Becky assigned me there til April after my previous manager left...did Becky not tell her? Then I brought up that again my schedule was a mess and was never fixed lol so I assumed I was there because her boss told me so but to please fix my schedule. She said OK and that she would clarify with Becky and let me know later. She never let me know, shocker.\\n\\nMy schedule is still the same so I go in and find out my benefits are gone. I didn't know my hours were that close to the cut off I didn't need them anyway I'm on my schools and partners anyway. I bring up I can work after like I have been to make up the hour of work and that would put me at the minimum for my benefits. I'm told absolutely not the assignment states they don't need me after 430 , per Becky. Also per Becky I will need to work another day if I want my benefits back. So essentially they were trying to bully me into working more hours by taking my benefits away, the same manager that knew I had ADA accomidations for chronic illnesses and disabilities AND WHY working another day would not work for me. So I said, I don't need the benefits I was just offering so the work would get done, reminded her about my schedule yet again and apologized for not responding to a text that she ended with \\\"she would let me know\\\" when she didn't lol because she was upset about that too. I wanted to add that it didn't make sense that I couldn't work after because the office \\\"didn't need me\\\" but Becky and Delores thought I was able to work the same hour locked out of the location lol\\n\\nEnd of February I have finals, miss a call from Becky while at work. I'm not at my computer, I'm ya know up and working lol so I don't see the emails or work chats. Go home cram for finals, and following week I'm called to the office. I tried to get HR on the line before I went in because I had a gut feeling and have heard that Becky is extremely nasty sometimes...no dice.\\n\\nI set my phone to audio record. They proceed to talk to me like I'm an irresponsible child, I'm tag teamed interuped when trying to explain myself or belittled and accused of lying. Tell me I'm disrespectful, pot meet kettle lol And the most ironic, I don't communicate. My uniform is picked apart, because why not, for things that make no sense or have never been a problem before so I had no idea but they apply now because ya know TOXIC lol And the most odd thing, my auto reply for emails is offensive because it asks to email my other one...apparently that made Becky feel like I'm trying to \\\"be her boss by telling her what to do\\\" \\nHr reachs out, I started a case after the first email about the benefits. I describe the meeting to the HR person, I get the feeling that she's more  worried about the emails and lack of communication after the management change then the abusive meeting I endured. Also I'm informed that there is a no recording policy...but I know for a fact if I didn't record it would have been \\\"sorry this is just he said she said\\\" because that's what HR always says lol toxic workplaces and management right?! So I'm working on leaving and have two interviews, I was offered a transfer to stay but I'm not sure i should take it because if this is how it's gunna be everywhere I'd rather just go. Should I even bother following through with HR maybe I should just let them know to drop it? Everytime I've went to HR its brushed off or blows up in my face and it feels like a blow up because of this recording policy. At the same time, there's no way HR doesn't already know they have awful communication and bad attitudes with over 100 people working in this team and  experiencing the same things. Not to mention the fact that she  knows I have issues, even after I broke down in a panic attack during the meeting and told them about my recent struggles with PTSD and weekly treatments i didn't even get an apology for lashing out at me in the beginning or accountability for the issues I brought up that they never fixed or Becky ignoring my emails for two months.\\n\\nI didn't get an official write up, I think my break down might have caused that. I got a disingenuous email follow up highlighting the \\\"discussion\\\" that I haven't replied too because I have a meeting with the work therapist I've been working with to manage my triggers at work (one of which is avoidance of things that cause triggers, like said email) and I plan to summarize everything to her and ask for help with a reply and some advice. \\n\\nSo HR people...what should I do? These two shouldn't be allowed to treat people this way but at the same time why should I bother when HR might not care anyway?

I've tried to give enough context so that people who are unfamiliar with the regulatory context can also chime in.\\n\\nMy manager and I disagree on this; obviously I defer and cede to her interpretation in dealing with the EE, but I can't help but feel our practice is flawed (and perhaps our policy contradicts itself).\\n\\nWe have an EE who worked 3 x 12-hour shifts all of 2023. They worked a weekend shift where a shift premium essentially brought them up to 3 x 13.33...-hour shifts per week (i.e., they are paid for 40 hours over 3 days).\\n\\nEE carried-over 2 vacation days out of an original entitlement of 9 days (3 weeks x 3 days).\\n\\nThis brought EE's entitlement up to 2+9=11 days in 2024.\\n\\nHowever, the EE switched from the weekend shift (3 x 13.33 hour) to a 4-day weekday shift (4 x 10 hour) at the beginning of 2024. This changes their original entitlement to 12 days.\\n\\nHere's where things get sticky.\\n\\nI argue that the 2 days of carryover are 13.33 hours. This corresponds to the law in ON for employees with over 5 years of service (6% of income is paid out over the year, essentially 3 weeks of vacation).\\n\\nMy manager argues that the 2 days transmogrify into 10-hour days.\\n\\nThe EE argues that they have an entitlement this year of 14 full days PLUS 6.67 hours (12 x 10 hours PLUS 2 x 13.33 hours = 146.67). I am inclined to agree with them.\\n\\nMy manager argues that the EE has an entitlement of 140 hours (12 x 10 hours PLUS 2 x 10 hours = 140 hours).\\n\\nOur policy states the following:\\n\\n|Annual Vacation Entitlement|Hourly Accrual Rate|\\n|:-|:-|\\n|15 days or 120 hours|6%|\\n\\nand further:\\n\\n>**Foregoing Vacation**  \\n>  \\n>It is a policy of \\\\[COMPANY\\\\] to not issue vacation pay in lieu of time not taken.  \\n>  \\n>**Carryover**  \\n>  \\n>Employees are encouraged and expected to use their vacation entitlement within the calendar year it was earned.  However, with the written approval of the manager, an employee may carry over entitled vacation days (maximum of 2 days) from the current year to the next year.  It is to the discretion of the company to approve additional carryover days based on circumstance.\\n\\nManager argues that EE can carry over the 2 days, but loses the 6.67. We do not give partial days and do not \\\"issue vacation pay in lieu of time not taken.\\\" We allow only a maximum of 2 days carried over to the next year.\\n\\nI argue that EE accrued that vacation entitlement at a rate of 6% of earnings during the last year, EE only took 93.33 hours of vacation, and has 26.67 hours of vacation remaining. At the very least, we should be paying out 6.67 hours of vacation in lieu of time not taken. \\\"At the discretion of the company\\\" we can approve the additional 6.67 hours of carryover based on this circumstance.\\n\\nOther problems:\\n\\n1. The policy only specifies days for a 5 x 8 hour shift and no other shifts; only hours are the relevant point of reference.\\n2. This EE has fewer than 5 years of service, so the statutory requirement for 6% accrual is not required by law; our policy is a greater benefit. My manager argues that we are not contracting out of our statutory requirements with this employee by making that 6.67 hours \\\\*POOF\\\\* disappear, and so it's fine.\\n3. Assuming the EE is entitled to 3 weeks of vacation time AND pay, the relevant statute separately requires 3 weeks of vacation time and 3 weeks of vacation pay; so we could be in case where we are not entitled to give the 6.67 hours as paid time off, but we are required to pay the 6.67 hours out out as vacation pay.\\n4. Manager also argues (somewhat vindictively and patronizingly I would say) that it's not fair that EEs accrue at one pay rate before a raise and then get paid out at the higher rate. She argues that this \\\"loophole\\\" makes up for some of the 6.67 hours anyway.\\n5. Manager further argues that the employee really only worked 12 hours and the extra 1.33 hours was a shift premium for work actually completed. So employee really only has 4 hours, not 6.67 hours to worry about. I argue that they accrue the pay as if they worked 40 hours, and when we pay out the vacation pay, we pay out a full day as 13.33 hours, not 12 hours.\\n6. That \\\"Foregoing Vacation\\\" clause is borderline illegal, I'm pretty confident. If we owe EEs paid vacation time that has been left unpaid, we can either force them to take vacation or must pay it out in lieu of time not taken.\\n7. I think that 6.67 hours for one EE is very little in the grand scheme of things. Not that it should matter, but EE is a good EE. The problem can go away and the employee would be satisfied with just being paid for the 6.67 hours. I think it's good Employee Relations \\\\*and\\\\* the right thing to do \\\\*and\\\\* the required thing to do.\\n\\nI think that's it for now. Thank you for any and all help!

Recently my partner had a disagreement with a Maintenance Supervisor during troubleshooting and foul words were exchanged resulting in both receiving corrective action. That same day I also had an issue with the same Maintenance SPV but my situation was less severe bc I only asked for help and when I walked away he called me stupid for not knowing how to fix things and insulted me. I went to HR bc this is not the first time this Maint.SPV had said negative things about me. I haven\\u2019t done anything to make him dislike me but I think just because im dating my partner who he doesn\\u2019t like, he spites me as well. Anyways a couple days after my complaint, my boyfriend ended up receiving his written warning and we both get an e-mail saying that out relationship needs to be documented with HR to ensure no conflict of interests occur, which to me was odd because this was already documented 4years prior and the managers at the time approved it and allowed us to work in the same department since technically I dont do anything that has to do with compensation, payroll,promotions or performance assessments (things of nature). Now fast forward to today, I am now receiving an e-mail about how our relationship is not appropriate and one of us needs to move department or shift. To me this feels like retaliation because the Maintenance Supervisor was the one that made the report about us dating\\u2026 My supervisor and manager (which is the same one for my boyfriend btw, so you know for a fact I dont do anything in regards to payroll and all that) had not sat me or my boyfriend down to tell us we are underperforming or showing favoritism, because we all know this isnt the case for us and we can both me professional and meet our targets. My coworkers have not expressed to anyone that they are uncomfortable with my partner and I working together in the 4 years ive been in my role either. I have always been fair and professional and people question if im even dating my partner sometimes bc since I know him my expectations of his task completion is higher and if anything I hold him more accountable that others. I have another meeting with HR about this matter but this whole situation screams retaliation and im not sure if there is anything I can do or say. anyways I will post the policy for Personal relationships too so you guys can give me some insight.

I emailed John regarding this, and cc'd Roger on it as well. John wrote back and told me I had read into it wrong, that he wasn't asking me to not disclose that we were fundraising, that he was asking me not to do so in conjunction with asking if the prospect had time, as it gives them an out.

As such certain individuals would abuse this and show up early and do nothing during the day leading to a recent OT policy change (more on that later).\\n\\nBack to my development, I complained and had conversations with direct leadership on first (department manager) and on second (supervisor) (not with third sup for obvious reasons). I was told that I am fresh and they are watching me to ensure that I maintain my quality. I am now achieving near continuous SOP standards and as such have reinvested myself into rectifying this situation. They report me for any and all infractions discovered during my shift, I am now able to prove that these infractions come from the previous shift.

Again to be fair they are the established workers in the department, but they are not my boss and they are not my trainers. I have requested minimal contact unless related to business matters which is moderately met. \\n\\nPROBLEM EVOLUTION!\\n\\nThey cut OT for all departments and shifts in the facility...except for third. This was publicly confirmed by supervisors and leadership who have stated that third in my department is exempt from these changes as they continue to push out the numbers required to make them profitable. Other workers have raised their concerns about this treatment and been shot down and told there is no choice in the matter. We all have to request OT except for third in my department. \\n\\nOn top of that they are still targeting me and trying to report me for other workers infractions vs. Asking me about the situation and trying to resolve it and improve the new guy. They are all related and have friendly relations with one of the faculty managers. They stifle my ability to learn new areas in my own department because I am kept to what I know in order to make the transition to third easier for them. I have requested to be transfered to a different postion literally anywhere so long as it gets me away from them, their scrutiny and their privilege. \\n\\nI want to work learn and grow so that I am seen as a competent and loyal hard working individual but this is nigh impossible with the pressures above me and the need to ensure a smooth transition of work flow from first directly to third. And im forced to keep my head down around them as they have sway in the facility. \\n\\nWhat lead me to making this post was a continuation of comments direct at me from third that I have interpreted as harassment (sup asks if my task was complete to which third responds for me \\\"no its not done he only fucking did steps one and two and brought the product to lab\\\" and then proceeded to walk away after giving me a dirty stare) I was working from 2-730 which is when I finally took my lunch followed by continuing the process that I was originally prescribed I had been working with my sup throughout the day in order to help set up for third. \\n\\nI let my sup know that due to the interaction and the proof of my continual reporting of this harassment over the course of the last year that I would be reporting this to hr he recommended another conversation with first manager (he manages department) I agreed as I have been continually building my case aganist them the entire time with both sup and manager (keeping them both in the loop and recording dates of conversations, thirds infractions and interactions) \\n\\nIt might not sound like that much harassment but it's hard to really put a years worth of complaints in a single post. \\n\\n\\nAll that being said, I know that this conversation with my manager won't go anywhere and that I will continue to be harassed by third, I have indicated that I will be continuing to escalate with every subsequent interaction as I have attempted to get away from them, talk to them, not talk to them, learn from them, report them help them and finally just mind my own fucking business. Nothing has worked and I'm certain that even if I talk to the facility manager nothing will come of it leading me to HR and dumping this situation on them. From a business perspective they are more valuable than me and I am concerned they will begin to increase scrutiny on me from leadership in order to find a legal reason to let me go. \\n\\nI want to get ahead of that curve and I'm planning on getting into contact with a lawyer to discuss options if it goes that way. \\n\\nTL;DR \\nThird shift gets special treatment and targets me with accusations that could get me fired. I'm trying to resolve this situation without losing my job. \\n\\nThanks everyone!\"", "title": "[Wi] 3 people recieve preferential treatment compared to the rest of the factory", "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1bedxfw/wi_3_people_recieve_preferential_treatment/"}, {"author": "Honest_Ambition_7529", "created_utc": 1710376887.0, "num_comments": 1, "post_id": "1be8274", "score": 0, "subreddit": null, "text": "\"\\nI\\u2019ve worked my buns off as a senior leader in a start up for the past two years.

I have recently gotten through to the final step in an interview process, through a personal connection to a senior in a company, where I was told that I will hear back from them by a specific date. I told them I would contact them if they didn't inform me, and they encouraged me to do so. The date passed without any update. I recontacted person 1- not the hiring manager- and tried to contact person 2- the hiring manager- multiple times. Person 1 has responded telling me that the date would be pushed by 5 days. After those days, I attempt to recontact them both. Person 2 has not responded to any calls, messages, mails or anything despite accepting me on LinkedIn in the meantime. Person 1 once again responded, telling me that the decision process is still going on.

It just doesn't bode well. \\n\\n\\nThis is going to be a little complicated. I just started work in a call centre last Monday, this is week two. I am currently classified legally homeless and living in a hotel. This job is my ticket out of that. I have given the company my parents and grandpa's address for my address. My actual address for the past 9 weeks is a hotel that the local authority are kindly paying for me to use until I get a fixed address. \\n\\n\\nThe week prior to me starting the job I had been to view a house share and applied for it and expected to be in by the Friday prior to starting work. It fell through at the absolute last minute. This job is 3 days work from home, 2 days in the office. I completely panicked and called my new employer asking if I'd be able to delay my start date, because my understanding from the local authority was that they would help me with first months rent and deposit while I was unemployed, but that changed the second I became employed -- which was a nightmare because in my mind there's an additional 6 weeks at most before I get a full pay and my God, I want out of the hotel. I had emailed and asked on HR chat for someone to call me about it and then my phone rang and it was someone from my new employer. I explained my current situation and they said they understood and would go and find out if I could delay my start date. \\n\\n\\nI then called the council because I was worrying about what would happen with the hotel etc and it turned out that I'd misunderstood. They'd still be able to help me with my first month's rent and deposit up to when I could afford to sort it myself, which was absolutely what I needed to hear. I don't care who sorts it I just don't want to be on the street. I've paid for myself for the past 10 years, I'm not scared of it. I just need the support at this present time. \\n\\n\\nMy new employer called me back and said I had an option to start on 18th April, but I said it's okay, I spoke to the council and they can still help me and 18th April is way too far away. Then it became clear that it wasn't HR calling me, it was one of the team leaders in the department I was joining. Wasn't delighted about that but it just so happened she was calling to do checks on everyone prior to them starting at the same time I was asking HR to call me. This team leader said I couldn't work from the hotel and I'd need to be in the office every day. Fine.  \\n\\n\\nIn a turn of events even I can't flipping believe I came down with a really awful cold/flu bug on Monday. I went into the office on Monday, but Tuesday I just couldn't do it. I had a horrible fever and despite my precarious situation I decided to take the day off sick.  I got a call half way through the day asking me what are my symptoms, I explained cold and flu symptoms. The caller said I need to be there really, when will I be back (I said tomorrow), how do I know I'll be better tomorrow? Which, is an awful approach but I get it. I didn't take it personally. \\n\\n\\nI went back today as promised and after a team talking to where we were told we were expected not to have sick time unless our heads were falling off I was taken for my return to work meeting. This meeting started by this team leader saying \\\"so, you live in a hotel?\\\" which really caught me off guard because my records show my grandpa's address, I haven't told anyone but that one team leader on that call that I'm living in a hotel. I said how do you know that and she said it's on your record. I said I've only told one person about that. I can't remember exactly the conversation from there, except for when she asked me how I'd ended up in a hotel I told her the full story (which includes an episode of psychosis, being misdiagnosed bipolar, and then an incident involving my stepdad). She mentioned she also has bipolar disorder and it just felt like an off the record chat, to the side of the issue that I had cold and flu symptoms. \\n\\n\\nShe asked if I was better, I said yes even though I clearly wasn't. She explained the company offer salary advances and that there's mental health support. She asked if there was anything else I needed from them. I said no and thanked her for the conversation and her sensitivity. \\n\\n\\nFor the sake of the post, imagine my name is Adam. In my training group is someone else called Alan.\\n\\n\\nA few hours later Alan was told that an email was on his laptop and it needed to be deleted by management immediately. The group leader went and deleted the email before Alan had chance to read it. \\n\\n\\nAnother couple of hours later, I received a written up document with my return to work in it. It starts off talking about Adam (but then changes to talking about Alan). The document included everything I discussed in the return to work, even the parts that were not in any way pertinent to my sickness of cold and flu symptoms. There's a record of my psychosis, everything I said. \\n\\n\\nMy suspicion (and it's not a giant leap, is it) that Alan was emailed my return to work document by mistake. They haven't told me about this. \\n\\n\\nBut my bigger issue is that I've checked on the system and my record shows nothing about the hotel. So I know that the team leader I mentioned the hotel to has told other team leaders. I was looking forward to a fresh start with nobody knowing my current situation.

During mid-last year I was too stressed finding a place to live and dealing with loved ones who were ill so I didn\\u2019t have the bandwidth to update my resume and land another job.\\n\\nI then found out from another colleague (who I bonded with when she witnessed my supervisor yell at me), that my supervisor had also targeted/ bullied her plus another one of her teammates. I also had a few other colleagues who had left because of this supervisor being their manager. I didn\\u2019t see it when they left since that was when I was being love-bombed (for lack of a corporate term). \\n\\nI had brought up my concerns to my so-called HR representative but each time he told me to \\u201cassume positive intent\\u201d or hope for the best. I was nervous because I could tell she wanted to label me as a poor performer and get me fired so I hoped HR could help. We had a meeting with him and she said all the corporate things to keep her safe and make him think all is good. I had hope things would change too.\\n\\nHowever, when I learned that this was patterned behavior and after getting yelled at during our 1:1 for smiling, I filed a whistleblower report. From the beginning it seemed that this different HR person wasn\\u2019t taking it seriously as they told me I\\u2019d have an update within a week then they switched and said these things take time. I shared all my evidence and would often message with updates/questions and not hear back until the 3rd message.  \\n\\nSide note: thankfully I filed when I did because, as expected, the supervisor graded my performance below target for petty reasons. This was the first rating of that sort I\\u2019ve received in my 15 year career.\\n\\nI started to think they (WB \\u201cinvestigators\\u201d) hoped I\\u2019d quit before having to take any action. After almost 6 months they informed me that after speaking with other managers, they didn\\u2019t find sufficient evidence of my claims.

And now I\\u2019m currently typing this with only 2 hours of sleep because the anxiety of having my 1:1 today is causing me insomnia.

I\\u2019m feeling really screwed over right now. Essentially the details are as follows:  \\nThis January I transitioned to a new role within same company network to a sister company with continuous service from march 2022 built into my contract, which would bring my total employment time to over 2 years now. The position is remote, with myself being based up north and the company is in London. I have been working this way for over 2 years if you include my previous role, and had never had anything but great performance reviews and top feedback from clients and team mates, even taking into account the below the company I\\u2019m at now keeps reiterating that I have zero performance issues.   \\nVery soon into the role, I raised concerns about ongoing bullying within the workplace, which meant that they put someone in between myself and the bully with the aim of managing workflows but this new person grew to resent the fact that they had to do it and basically made their feelings super clear on the issue to me.   \\nDespite my concerns and the impact on my well-being, the company has communicated that if I cannot work with the individual responsible for bullying, there is no alternative position, especially unless I move to London as the whole agency has just this year (after I'd been hired) decided to enforce 3-4 days in the office in central London. I\\u2019m quite concerned that my efforts to address the bullying issue may have resulted in a penalisation, particularly in relation to finding an alternative position within the company, as I can\\u2019t move to London due to family commitments.  \\nThe new contract specifies a 3-month probationary period but does not explicitly mention when this period should be completed. As far as I am aware I\\u2019ve already completed probation as I was under the understanding that my 3 month probation carried over with my continuous service, in addition to which I have an email from the payroll manager stating that all my benefits carry over from my previous role including my pension which I\\u2019ve started paying into already again since joining (which the contract says doesn\\u2019t kick in until my probation has been completed, so mixed signals). \\n\\nI have received no documentation nor had any probation-related meetings and the first I heard of it was when I was threatened with 1 week\\u2019s termination by my line manager in a fit of rage when I raised my concerns about the bullying and the impact on my well-being. After a call with HR yesterday the company has essentially communicated that if I cannot work with the individual responsible for bullying, there is no alternative position unless I moved to London. Meanwhile I am already working with teams in London and have been able to do my Job from up north for more than 2 years without issue.    \\n\\t  \\nAs if this couldn\\u2019t get worse, I\\u2019ve been riddled with stress and anxiety about all this and its impact on my finances were I to lose this job, as the number of roles on the market are dwindling as the economy seems to worsen. My manager has urged me repeatedly to take time off claiming to \\u201csupport you and you mental health\\u201d, however I checked my contract and it says that while after 2 years service I should receive 6 weeks paid sick leave, under probation I\\u2019m just entitled to the statuary minimum. So while I was off sick for 2 days, I\\u2019m having to return to work out of fear of not getting my sick leave benefits which I\\u2019ve otherwise been entitled to for nearly 2 years.   \\nPlease can someone advise me as to my rights? I\\u2019m worried about losing my job due to unfair dismissal and not getting my sick pay and it\\u2019s frankly wrecking my health.

My dream is to just be full time at a place that I can love working at diligently while being considered \\\"long term\\\" and \\\"valuable\\\", helping the company grow. The technical skills I have acquired over a very long career often have value, but contracting means I'm forced to be a \\\"temporary person\\\" in the form of a contractor or consultant and I don't think that life has helped me or my social anxiety. My social anxiety has gotten worse the last couple years because of the forced isolation, but now I'm taking care of family members with cancer related compromised immune systems so I'm stuck isolated and I'm getting feedback that my prior contracting at MS/AMZN/etc is keeping me from getting interviews. I'm not sure what to do.\\n\\nI'm a full stack engineer and can point to prior success in my career to validate that. I am language/platform agnostic. I'm mature enough of a software developer that I know that my job isn't to write software code, it's to solve business problems writing software code, and that these are two different things. I have helped design a few programming languages used widely in the industry, have been a principle software developer a few times, and mostly end up leading teams of engineers. I honestly enjoyed being a software engineering director the most, but these roles are hard to find.\\n\\nI'm also fully aware that nobody is perfect, and I'm happy to keep growing and learning.

I understand that my social anxiety hurts me, but I'm working on it, even this post is yet another attempt to be brave.\\n\\nMost of my experience is at FANG companies and I'm worried that gives me a bias I want to be mindful of, but I also did a few startups and tried to grow that way, too. I enjoy the smaller teams of the startups, and although I have good intentions, I think my biggest gap is my social anxiety as it tends to make me want to overexplain so people have context and know my intentions are good.  In the past I've had people tell me that this makes it sound like I'm blaming others when I'm really not; if anything I envision this as me being open and transparent in an honest effort to take personal accountability and grow as a human.  I'm doing my best to accept feedback I get and pivot to the best communication style that works with the people I'm interacting with at any given time.\\n\\nI want to try to help a company as a longer term employee because I recognize that I can't do it alone by myself. Even with my technical skills I still have gaps (Marketing and sales are classic engineer gaps) like any human would, and so the best place for me is to work with the team and just contribute my technical skills toward the common goal. There was a time earlier in my career when I didn't believe that and I thought I could do it all myself; I burned out and had to really reconsider my place in the world.\\n\\nI've hired resume professionals in the past and it has not helped.

I was trained by a different coworker who has been here for 1 year. \\n\\nBackground: last week, I was looking at the credit card transactions I had to process. C\\u2019s transactions sometimes get assigned to me. C has stated before that if it isn\\u2019t assigned to them. They have no responsibility. So when this happens I will complete her transactions for her because not doing them will negatively effect me. I had about 15 of C\\u2019s transactions and I had mentioned to her had she ever tried getting these assigned to her because I wanted to try and I don\\u2019t want to keep doing her work and I didn\\u2019t want to waste my time finding the resolution if there isn\\u2019t one. She sent this conversation to my boss and said my obnoxious behavior was enough. On top of this, C has a history of harassing me and Y knew. This hurt my feelings and responded well but, I was argumentative. Our supervisors had one on ones with us and asked me what I would like done. I just said, written warning and let\\u2019s just keep it professional. I can move on. I think Y got in trouble for allowing C\\u2019s behavior against me to continue and eventually land in an email. And/or not handling this situation as I had time to respond to C\\u2019s email and Y had time to take control. My intentions were purely to aid C, to find a solution and to end me being assigned her work. \\n\\nThey told me I need to learn EQ. And learn how to talk to C because she takes things differently\\u2026.\\n\\nToday my boss was very upset with me. She was furious that the vendor from the credit card transactions emailed me back today and not C, blaming me for continuing to work with them even though I know I shouldn\\u2019t. I answered by saying I cannot control their response and I am no longer working with them. She said that C doesn\\u2019t want to work on them anymore because I am working on it. I was just like OK. She said to leave the room because she\\u2019s getting pissed because she doesn\\u2019t understand why I\\u2019m so confused that I shouldn\\u2019t work with her transactions. So I printed out the email from C saying she has no responsibility if it\\u2019s assigned to me, and I pointed out how Y sent an email earlier last week saying I had a lot of credit cards transactions and I needed them done by end of day. So that\\u2019s why I was compelled to do her work.\\n\\nSo I left and came back 5 min later and I was like hey! I love working here, I love my team, I love working for you so if you can please let me know what you would like to see from me going forward?  She gave me examples. Then I told her I hope my actions speak for themselves. And I thought we were on the same page.\\n\\nA few hours later, we are looking at this invoice that has a new contract. Last month Y sent an email saying this vendor needs a new PO for the contract. Last month, C told me she was handling this.

Y accepted the truth and went forward to start the process of creating a new PO.\\n\\nWhen it was time to leave to I was trying to inform my boss I was going home. Y was in her office with my office mate L, and the door was closed. I knocked and L says aggressively \\u201cdo you need something?!?\\u201d And I said I\\u2019m going home! I had clocked in 15 minutes early so, I was leaving 15 min early. Y looked really upset and asked me who let me in the office?! And I told her who. Y says \\u201cI am going to ask them you better not be lying.\\u201d I said I actually got here earlier than that and left. \\n\\nSo, I was thinking since I have had no disciplinary action that I should just brown nose and strictly keep it professional.\\n\\nAny advice? \\n\"", "title": "[FL] Boss is upset.

X is my manager. Y is me. Z is another member of staff.\\n\\n  \\nX opened the meeting by asking Y what his understanding of the job role was.  \\nY: my role is Night Porter, and I am required to carry out duties according to my contract. The role means a lot to me, and I really like the people I work with.  \\nX: how would you describe your approach to work and how do you handle your tasks?  \\nY: I try to carry out my tasks satisfactorily and if not then I will rectify how I do things. For example, Z recently spoke to me about not cleaning the toilets properly and as I have not been spoken to since, I assume that I am carrying that task out to the expected standard.  \\nX: The other day, I spoke to you about cleaning the sauna and making sure that you collected the wet towels. You had previously been asked to make sure you did this but hadn\\u2019t been. You also said to me that you had mopped the floor, but despite this it was still wet 30 minutes later.  \\nY: I clean it every night, I make sure that the footprints are cleaned away, yes, I know you said that there was a puddle but I went back and did it again after you said this. I have some personal worries right now; my family is facing losing their house and so I apologise if I have been a little distracted and forget and that is why last night I forgot.  \\nI have also never worked in a hotel before unlike the other team members, yourself, Z and Z and so maybe I need more training and guidance. I\\u2019m sorry if this makes your job more difficult.  \\nX: I understand that you have not worked in a hotel before, however, 99% of the issues of you not doing your job comes from a lack of common sense. For example, you took a mop from the 3rd floor and then just left it at reception instead of returning it and then Z was not able to find it the next day.  \\nX: Another example of you not performing is recently when you decided not to do the floor walk according to standard operating procedures. You just took it upon yourself to do this at a different time and not as often.  \\nY: This was when I had a foot injury which you knew about as I came in on crutches. You were completely dismissive of this, never asked how I was and did not seem to care. It is not nice having a manager who does not care about the wellbeing of their staff. Yes, I should have done the floor walk, but was in pain that night. When I work with Z, he carries out the floor walk, did you know that?  \\nX: Z and I do things differently.  \\nX: There are many times that your tasks have to be redone, for example, recently when you were hoovering there was still a lot of dirt on the floor that I came across when I was trying to mop afterwards. I said to you at the time, and you said you would use another hoover, however there was still a lot of dust.  \\nY: It is not my fault that the hoover did not work. I have been here for 4 months, and I know I have been spoken to before, but I have improved my performance.  \\nX: Do you remember what you said previously about having to tidy up in the kitchen? You swore as you were not happy to do this.  \\nY: You know that we all swear at times when we are working together, but it doesn't mean to say that I will not do my job. A few months ago, I was offered another job and you said that all I\\u2019d be doing was cleaning toilets, so I stayed here. And here I am, cleaning toilets and cleaning up.  \\nIt would be helpful if someone was to go through the checklist and point out to me what I am not doing correctly.  \\nI apologise for my previous poor performance, and if I express my distaste for doing some tasks, I apologise but I am still doing them.  \\nX: Yes, your performance is better than previously when I first spoke to you, but you are still not performing to the level required with the correct attitude. I need you to approach your duties and carry them out as you would if you were doing them for yourself in your own home.  \\nY: Okay, I understand now, you have never put it that way before. I will do all the tasks as expected and apologise for my previous poor performance.  \\nDo you have any questions?  \\nY: No\\n\\n  \\nThese were the minutes. now im showing emails between me and HR the. day after the investigation meeting took place, when i was emailed that i have a disciplinary meeting.\\n\\n  \\nY: What stage am I currently at in the disciplinary procedure?  \\nHR: this is the hearing stage. After the hearing Z will decide what if any action is to be taken which in this instance could be:  \\nNo further action  \\nVerbal warning  \\nFirst written warning  \\nY:Is dismissal an outcome?  \\nHR: Due to the nature of the concern and given that this is your first disciplinary hearing, then dismissal is unlikely, however please do refer to the Disciplinary procedure. Z will decide on an appropriate outcome.\\n\\n  \\nNow im curious as to where i stand. Will they fire me? I have a feeling that they want to because days before i was even notified of the investigation meeting, a vacancy of my position was posted online.

Right now we have left it with either she accepts Ann as her manager and listens to her or it'll be best if she moves on. She actually called me yesterday after she clocked out to complain about Ann again. I made it extremely clear that Ann is the new director and if she can't accept the direction Ann and I are going then this isn't a good fit for a job for her. \\n\\nThis employee is so frustrating. I can handle the attitudes, the push back and the drama. I'm pretty certain the entire housekeeping department will need to be flipped and restaffed before the spring is out. I can even handle the one member of my staff that is the polar opposite of me politically (Dave! No Politics!). But I want to handle this properly and it has me frustrated at a loss. \\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: thank you all for your time and responses! Some of them actually had me laughing. I want to clarify - this is an extremely small company. I have roughly 15-20 employees under me and I'm the general manager of the hotel. I know I am a pushover and have probably been too lenient with Sue (and all of my staff). My boss and I call it DuchessStoHelit's Bleeding Heart. I'm working on it. So with this situation I'm definitely going to document, document, document. My boss and I have decided to focus more on the insubordination and not doing job duties aspect rather then the religion, just to be on firmer ground. I'm going to have one final meeting with her, Ann, her job description and the handbook. But when Sue was angry she told me she had a job interview lined up for today so I'm hoping she gets the job and this can just disappear. \"", "title": "[MI] can I stop an employee from praising Jesus and praying in my office during a discipline meeting?

Upper management have also 'normalised' poor time keeping (so long as everyone is waiting *for them*). I realise that I am a high performer, with high standards for myself and others. I do expect my superiors to be just that: superior. When they exhibit incompetence and callousness, I lose respect for them. Is there a way of making myself less the way I am?

It's also a BIG problem for my health. I have gotten medical exemptions in the past from in-person work, in fact have worked fully remote for over 4 years due to my disabilities. My old boss and HR understood that I don't have control over my health and were accomodating. Working in person even a few days a week is a huge sacrifice for me because unfortunately I have severe health problems which are exacerbated by in-office work. I was fine with two days a week, but twice as much? Why didn't he communicate this expectation months earlier? Why did no one tell me this when I was going through interviews?

Now, here's the thing. This was really upsetting to hear days before I make a big move and the huge sacrifice of leaving behind friends and family and my entire life. It's also a BIG problem for my health. I have gotten medical exemptions in the past from in-person work, in fact have worked fully remote for over 4 years due to my disabilities. My old boss and HR understood that I don't have control over my health and were accommodating. Working in person even a few days a week is a huge sacrifice for me because unfortunately I have severe health problems which are exacerbated by in-office work. I was fine with two days a week, but twice as much? Why didn't he communicate this expectation months earlier? Why did no one tell me this when I was going through interviews? I could have argued for a much higher salary although realistically, I would not have accepted the role if I had known.\\n\\nWhat are the reasonable steps I can take to salvage the situation? I don't wish to disclose my disabilities unless I absolutely have to. That's private medical information that I don't want to share with my company if I can avoid it, and a huge hassle to ask my doctor for paperwork, but there is a preexisting paper trailed precedent of me working remote due to my disabilities.\\n\\nDo I have any recourse here? Can I ask HR to give me a higher salary or bonus since they weren't honest about what the role needs and I'm doing way more hours than the 40hrs/week I signed up for? How can I put my foot down about two days a week being what I signed up for?\\n\\nI also worry that my boss is going to walk all over me every chance he gets. I'm beyond stressed about the whole thing, and am anxious there may be further unpleasant surprises.\\n\\nThis is my first salaried, non-union role so I'm out of my depth.

Since I started this new position there have been countless changes, and all of the changes I included in this post are relevant to my questions at the end. I\\u2019m using a burner account and being intentionally vague about what I do to protect my identity.   \\nA year ago I started working at a company as an Area Manager with 50 people who report directly to me. There are two distinct job titles at our company, Area Manager (my job) who has less than 100 employees under them, and Regional Manager who makes more money and has 100 employees under them.   \\nAbout a month ago, the company had a massive reorganization, and as a result my position was moved to a newly created affiliate company. The original company I started with shifted its priorities to only work within the state where the company was founded, and where we have the most stores, while the new company that I now find myself in now manages all of the out of state stores. Aside from this distinction, all along we\\u2019ve been told that the new company would operate identically to the original company in terms of pay, benefits, operations, HR policies, etc.   \\nEveryone at this new company is brand new, and honestly the management knows nothing about how the original company operated. The new company is certainly dealing with its share of growing pains, and right now it\\u2019s frankly a sh\\\\*t show in terms of consistency/operations/everything. I'm trying to remain optimistic that the dust will settle in another month or two and things will stablize.    \\nAbout two weeks ago my new manager (who\\u2019s also brand new to the company) reached out to me to tell me that he was going to change my title to Regional Manager. I explained to him the difference between my current title of \\u2018Area Manager\\u2019 and \\u2018Regional Manager,\\u2019 and told him that since I started with the original company last year, I had been told my title would change to Regional Manager once I have 100 direct reports, and that I would get a pay increase then. He thanked me for being honest, and for explaining he difference between the titles, because that was news to him. Following that conversation I was copied on an email exchange between my new manager and HR, in which HR confirmed that the threshold for the title change from AM to RM was having 100 direct reports.   \\nFast forward to today: I\\u2019m already working under a different manager (the guy I had the previous conversation with is now my new manager\\u2019s manager), and as of today I also now have a new co-worker/peer on my team whose title is \\u2018Regional Manager.\\u2019 She and I are the only two people on this team/at this level/in these positions with the new company. Out of curiosity, I did some digging and found out that my new co-worker has 60 direct reports, so she is still far below the 100 employee threshold, and she has only 10 more direct reports than I do, but she still started with the higher job title and salary of a Regional Manager. I know her salary is higher because I saw the salary range posted for the Regional Manager position, and even the bottom end of the range was higher than what I currently make as an Area Manager.   \\nI think hiring the new person with this job title and pay was an honest mistake. I don\\u2019t think HR knew how many direct reports this new position would have, and I don\\u2019t think the distinction between Area Manager and Regional Manager was conveyed to the hiring manager.  Like I said, in terms of operations this new company is a clusterf\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*.   \\nSo, now that I know there\\u2019s a discrepancy/error in my new co-workers title and compensation, what do I do?

I can\\u2019t imagine them cutting the new hire\\u2019s pay, since that would be punitive, so would they give me the higher title and pay to make it fair? Is there a possibility that they'll just shrug it off as an error, and not do anything to make it fair?  \\nI\\u2019m also debating if I should bring this issue up now, or wait for the dust to settle a little more (new company, shit show). My only concern in waiting to bring this up, is that the longer I wait, the longer I might be missing out on missed potential wages.   \\nIf and when this discrepancy/error comes to light, do you think there\\u2019s any possibility my company would pay me for back wages to today\\u2019s date, the date that the new hire started?\"", "title": "[WA] How should I handle a discrepancy in job title and pay with new hire?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1b7r2ft/wa_how_should_i_handle_a_discrepancy_in_job_title/"}, {"author": "Adventurous-Swing296", "created_utc": 1709685847.0, "num_comments": 7, "post_id": "1b7lx9v", "score": 2, "subreddit": null, "text": "\"Hate to be in this position but here we are.

I didn't think much of it, as we get gift baskets and treats from vendors quite often. So I gave him my name, and that was it. \\n\\n  \\nYesterday a check came in the mail (to our company office) addressed to me. I opened it up in front of my current boss (owner of the small business) and he said, \\\"that was a referral for a friend, right?\\\" As to which I responded, no, I don't even know who this was, I just referred them to this company because they are the only ones I know of that do this work.\\n\\n  \\nThe owner then said, \\\"well that's grounds for immediate termination.\\\" I was shocked by this statement, and didn't really know how to respond, as I knew nothing of this policy, and this is the first time this has ever happened. I told him that I didn't know they would be sending me a check, and that they never mentioned this over the phone when we spoke. I was just expecting a gift basket or something. He then says something along the lines of \\\"embezzlement fraud\\\" and that the money should be going to the company, not me personally. He then storms out of the office all flustered.   \\nI was left feeling like a piece of crap after this, and didn't know what to do. I have been nothing but loyal to this company, and would never jeopardize my position here over something like this. \\n\\n  \\nThe owner never came back yesterday, so I wasn't able to talk to him about this. \\n\\n  \\nThen this morning, he completely avoids me, and leaves the office without saying a word. \\n\\n  \\nI want to address this issue, but I don't know exactly how to approach him, as he is very emotional and hot headed. It is very difficult to have civil conversations with him about anything work related, if he doesn't agree.

The bathroom fans aren\\u2019t very loud, so I\\u2019m very embarrassed very often.
