I made a post a couple of days ago detailing how my boss chewed me out over getting help from a coworker. After that day, I thought everything was said and done till the next morning when my boss once again called me into his office.\n\nHe accused me having coworkers in MY office (like, why am I getting in trouble? I didn\u2019t invite them, and regardless I have an open door policy and love to help and answer questions where I can. Also, I was leaving in about a week, so people would often stop and talk or say goodbye) for FOUR HOURS. If anything, the few coworkers who DID stop by were there for 10-15 minutes at most, and would stop by from time to time for various reasons.\n\nThen, after I tried to reason and defend myself and my coworkers, he cut me off and told me it looked bad on me and that upper management had made comments. After that, he said something that absolutely shocked me: \u201cyou know, we didn\u2019t have to keep you after you put in your two weeks. But we vouched for you.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind, the only reason I put in two weeks to begin with is because its the professional thing to do. I have another job lined up. I would have loved to just quit lol. This was the bullshit I was tired of.\n\nI was shocked and nearly in tears. There was another person in his office awkwardly sitting there. I was overall just humiliated. After I left his office I cried a bit in my own office and packed all my belongings because I was debating walking out.\n\nI thought about it over the weekend and decided I would just flat out quit on Monday morning, which I did. \n\nHe was shocked? How can you be shocked after lowkey waving the threat of being fired around?\n\nEither way, I\u2019m glad to be out.

It was an offer and I've been unemployed for months, so even though they wouldn't negotiate on the salary, I accepted the job and started last Friday.\n\nHere's where the trouble started. On Friday afternoon, after a welcome lunch bought by my new colleagues, I got a call from a company I had interviewed with weeks before and had assumed I was no longer under consideration for. They offered me the job (same title) at a higher salary, and fully remote. I think it's a better fit for my skills and certainly for my lifestyle. It's a no brainer for me to accept.\n\nBut now I'm going to have to quit on my third day on the job at the first company. It's an extremely small company (5 people) and I'm their first hire who they haven't had a prior relationship with. They're all extremely nice and have been so kind and welcoming. I know I'm putting them in a bad position, as they hired me so quickly because they're extremely busy, and they wasted time and money hiring and onboarding me. I am in a 90 day probationary period where I'm able to quit or be terminated without notice, so technically I'm in the clear, but morally I feel awful about it and I'm worried about what the consequences might be for future job searches.\n\nThe time after my layoff has been the worst in my life and this is really just adding another layer of awfulness. I know I have to do what's best for me in the end but just hoping to maybe hear some reassurance that I'm making the right decision. I've never actually had to quit before, the company that laid me off was my first adult job. Any advice on how to do so gracefully in this situation without making things even worse?

This person had many meetings with HR & our manager because he was causing so many problems, but he\u2019s granted things bc the manager worked with him before. He left our job while being clocked into & not letting anyone know, he took a picture of one of our higher up admins & made fun of how tight his shirt was, he said very terrible things about others, he has lied about things our manager has said to him to make himself look better & the manager caught him. Everyone kisses this guys rear but he\u2019s so full of smoke, I don\u2019t understand how others don\u2019t see it. Truly, he\u2019s like the devil incarnated, and has everyone fooled. I have a hard time doing what he tells me to, because i know he thinks he\u2019s won. How do bad people always get what they want? I don\u2019t get it. \n\n\nBut how do I care less? How do I do this job for the money and not care about all that? I get paid well to have no attachment to the politics, but I\u2019m competitive & I feel like I\u2019ve lost.

I have taken many online career tests but most of them point me towards sciences or arts. I'm pathetically horrible at mathematics so no career in technology or finance for me. I chose no science subject in highschool so even if I wanted to, I couldn't chose a medical field.

In total, there are six of us: three employees, two interns, and our manager. My role is quite interesting, I am paid very well, and it provides valuable experience for my CV.\n\nHowever, my manager epitomizes a micromanaging boss! As I write this, he could be looking over my shoulder - no joke.\n\nHe is in his early 60s (just for some context, I am in my mid-30s) and is one of those old-school individuals who arrives at work at 8 AM and doesn't leave until 6-7 PM (sometimes I go out to walk the dog and I still see the light in his office switched on, LOL).\n\nMy employer has a policy in place for working from home, allowing us to work remotely for two days. In my first week, he subtly pressured me to only work from home for one day, but I addressed the issue and managed to secure two days. Today (Monday) is one of these agreed-upon remote work days, and I stayed at home. However, I have just received a semi-passive-aggressive email from him, questioning why I didn't come to the office this morning. After reminding him that we agreed on Monday and Wednesday as my work-from-home days, he stated that he didn't receive any official email from me, and that our oral agreement isn't valid without an email. In comparison, other teams  have much more flexibility, as long as there is agreement on the days when everyone is in the office. Even then, they exercise a greater level of flexibility.\n\nSpeaking of working from home, he never takes advantage of this option himself, and is present in the office five days a week. He is a workaholic who enjoys spending time in the office. Since his wife does not work, she takes care of household tasks while he is at work (such as taking out the garbage, going to the post office, receiving deliveries, cleaning, etc.), while I live alone and don't have the luxury to delegate such responsibilities. As a result I do these tasks during the weekend and I always end up feeling dreadful.\n\nHe wants to know every detail about what I (and the rest of the team) do on a daily basis. He frequently comes into my office to inquire about my current tasks. He insists on being CC'd in every email and rarely use MS Teams (preferring to communicate via email, even for minor and insignificant matters).\n\nAnother example occurred last week, when I produced 40 content pieces/files and sent them to him. One of the files had a spelling mistake in its name. He took a screenshot of the file name and asked me to rename it, which came about two hours after he had asked me to prioritize another task.\n\nIt would literally take him 2 secs to rename the file, instead he opted to do a screenshot, crop it, upload it and send it via email. What a complete waste of time!\n\nWe have weekly one-on-one catch-up meetings scheduled for 30 minutes, but they typically last between 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes.\n\nThe rest of the team feels the same way, and when we have rare moments alone, everyone expresses their frustration with our manager. However, they have learned to tolerate the micromanagement as they are content with the generous salary and other benefits.\n\nTo be very honest, he is an incredibly smart and eloquent person with a tone of relevant experience (he started our as a journalist for the Economist and NYT, and later switched to international affairs), speaks 3 languages.... but he is just very uncreative, controlling and lacks proper time management skills for a person of his position. I noticed that even our 2 interns are better managing their time than him!\n\nAs a result of all of this I feel deeply unhappy and I have already started applying to other jobs.\n\nAny tips on how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated.

I don't know that I ever intended to stay here this long but my company started as a close-knit feel and I felt like I was appreciate/valued until about 5 years ago and I've stayed. I was happy here until recently. \n\nLong story short, lots has happened in life and at work and it occurred to me that I haven't had a performance review in 6 years, nor any kind of raise (including a basic cost of living raise). It's getting to a point where I'm dipping into savings to cover my living expenses so I requested a performance review/ request for raise in April of last year. So far no performance review has been granted and when I follow up, I'm told many different reasons for the delay by upper management.  I'm at a point now where I am no longer feeling as understanding and patient as I was - I'm struggling to make ends meet and 20/hr since 2017 seems wholly unfair. \n\nHaving worked here since 2008 and worn many hats for the company, I've also held side jobs for extra income but those side gigs were offered to me without me seeking out the positions. I did not finish college and as such I feel awful about myself in terms of being able to secure a better job. The task of updating/refreshing/revamping my resume is very daunting and I'm starting to feel disheartened. \n\nHowever, friends are telling me that having 16 years at one company is an amazing thing and that many employers will be happy to see this longevity on my resume. I have never been written up (that I can recall at least) and have experience working in office and remote for the company. \n\nI guess I'm just looking for some input that can help light a fire under my butt and help me feel confident enough to tackle updating my resume.

Both my interviews were mere conversations about my career and only 30% time was spent in technical assessment.\n\nI know I am overthinking but I am just left confused about what exactly is happening here. The recruiter had told me there would be just two rounds and now I am told there might be another one.

Iris got promoted to the head of our department last year. Iris informed me last year that my direct supervisor will be changed as she cannot manage senior chemists in her new role. She can only supervise managers or team leads. Therefore, she contacted HR to move me to a different supervisor, her will call her Vicky. \n\nVicky is very kind, understands my work ethic, is hard working, and I have much to learn from her. We work well together. \n\nHere comes the problem\u2026\u2026 Iris still gives me tasks to do everyday without checking in with Vicky. Vicky gets annoyed by this but doesn\u2019t say anything to Iris. \n\nLast week, I took a sick day and told Vicky I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it in. Vicky understood and said she hoped that I felt better. The next day when I came in, Iris asked to be informed when I took a sick day. She said it wasn\u2019t a big deal but she needed to know when I am present and when I am not. When I told her that I informed my direct supervisor, Iris then told me she did not see Vicky until the end of the day so she had no way to know. \n\nI was a little annoyed by this but I let it go\u2026.until I spoke to Vicky today. Vicky told me that she informed Iris immediately in the morning that I would be absent. Not only this, Iris was livid that I didn\u2019t inform her instead. Vicky also told me that Iris only vaguely tells her what I am working on in a week. Finally, Vicky said I was placed under her so that Iris didn\u2019t have to fill out employee paperwork on me (approving vacation, employee evaluations, etc). \n\nThis puts me in an awkward situation. I am reporting to Vicky who doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing every day. How is Vicky supposed to properly evaluate me if I\u2019m not actually reporting to her? Iris only wants me to work for her without actually taking responsibility of me as an employee under her.\n\nAm I over reacting to this by being frustrated and angry with Iris?

You can't get it before or after an annual leave. You can't take if more than 5 people are taking on that day. It's annoying and it's just simple thing I'm saying, it feels like they want to control time after work too. They shouldn't care if work is getting done but more focus is on 9 hours at office, sitting there. Some people are getting more sick offs and WFH as they are on good terms, I got 4 sick off in winter and was poked about it to take care of health. Plus, sitting for 9 hours is exhausting. The work is not like you have to be in office, most people will do more efficiently from home but it's getting pretty annoying and I'm just controlling myself from reacting to HR.

I know might sound like silly rant but I'm 27, I gotta make a particular decision and run on that path now. I can't keep on delaying being divided in the options. It's either getting a very flexible, good cultured firm job or doing my own thing. \n\nCan be weird but can you people point at some emerging businesses and tracks I should look at? Or some pointers for how to figure out my best business plan. I have studied design thinking in college and back then it felt like I was so full of ideas, now after like 3 years, in which Covid was there too, feels like my ideas are lost and I can't think it all the way and make a plan, like I learned back then in startup foundry.

I would understand if they fired me (you just can't really count on me because of that).

I already had a conversation with my boss about it, who was understanding because the teachers there are also very often sick or have to call in sick.\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore.

I'm just desperate and just hoping that my future doesn't end on the streets. I would literally do any job right now, if that means i will get paid and i'm secure, but nobody wants an uneducated and unstable person.\n\nFor me, it's not about finding my dream job right now, it's about getting by IN ORDER to be able to afford university when I'm 25 (that's the goal).

There would also be a full-on marketing team for me to lean on and learn from, whereas, with The Salvation Army, I would be the only marketer. \n\nHow can I stall and convince The Salvation Army to give me time to make a decision so that I can interview with the hospital on Wednesday? I would hate to turn down this job offer, NOT get the job with the hospital, and then lose out on the nonprofit job as well. \n\nIt\u2019s a shame because I would love the kind of work I would be doing at the Salvation Army.

He's not the ceo but one step below. We'll call him Frank. \n\nEveryone else can't make it to our presentation. Frank had another engagement, I think news release right after our presentation.

He leaves his ringer on and his phone keeps buzzing. Rude. \n\nHe's sitting there texting while my director is trying to explain this marketing campaign.

Some people said that's just the way it is and you just need to accept they aren't listening. \n\nI don't think I could keep presenting a huge, involved project that we spent 100s of hours on while the person wasn't paying attention.

I\u2019m wanting to just give up and leave simply because of management. Every day we have 1 doctor (my boss who is the owner) and 2 optometrist assistants on shift ( me + someone else ). One does reception and the other does work ups. The thing is everytime I go in since I started my boss is always in my ear. He\u2019s always asking me what I\u2019m working on when I\u2019m clearly working on something right in front of him. This has continued from when I started till now and it\u2019s driving me up the wall. I\u2019ve noticed that he doesn\u2019t treat anyone else the way he does me. I\u2019m always super anxious when I go to work now it\u2019s just so bad because I feel like I have to go above and beyond for him to get off my back.  If I\u2019m on shift it\u2019s constantly pulling me aside to talk about workload amongst my coworkers and office duties. Honestly I\u2019m not a bad worker, I do my job I do what I\u2019m paid for and go home. What\u2019s making me question his behavior is that all my other coworkers go above and beyond for him and I just won\u2019t do that I refuse. He doesn\u2019t pay us enough to take work home, to do all these extra duties, errands that my other coworkers do. Another reason is that he changes up rules, for example we usually charge for retinal imaging at my office and if u see an ophthalmologist you don\u2019t have to pay that charge. We\u2019ve been having patients who come in and already do retinal imaging at another doctor so therefore we don\u2019t do it. He\u2019s been consistently saying that I\u2019m trying too hard not to do retinal imaging yet I\u2019m simply just following the rule he said but he told me we should know when we\u2019re \u201cpushing it\u201d. He consistently changes up office rules and then blames us if things don\u2019t go his way and it\u2019s super discouraging at this point because I feel like nothing I do is right anymore. I usually give a 2 weeks notice for every job I\u2019ve been at but I just simply want to quit. The thing is if I do quit I\u2019d guarantee would be leaving them short staffed. Since only 2 assistants work a day the work load would go to my coworker and I just feel bad. (We have a total of 5 assistants they would just be short on the days that I work) I\u2019m asking for different views/advice on this situation so please feel free to comment!

And in 3 more months I will be flat rate pay split with my mentor so say if me and him together book 80 hours a week then we\u2019ll split it 50/50 but I\u2019m just worried about anything less than 80 hours. I know this Industry has a lot of factors you can\u2019t rely on like insurance and parts coming in wrong or damaged etc but I\u2019m just worried for my future I suppose because if I get anything less than 40 flagged hours I will not be able to live anymore so I\u2019m just looking for some insight on what yall would do if you were in my situation. Honestly I think the way the program is set up with the pay wise just doesn\u2019t settle well with me but the issue is I\u2019m from Wisconsin and we haven\u2019t had any big snow storms or anything this year which is odd so that\u2019s affecting the work coming in with town ins etc. I talked with my GM and on avg the last 7 years he\u2019s been at this location there is about 300-450 hours of work every month since he\u2019s been at this location and right now with current situations were lucky to maybe even have 10-20 hours roll though the shop in a week or two. So I guess I\u2019m just looking for some advice before it\u2019s too late to withdraw from the program as just my living cost a month right now is $2480.

I had 10 interviews throughout the remainder of 2023 and almost got hired again, but they pulled out last minute when the person reviewing my application saw I was fired, even though we discussed it in the interview (different person doing the review.) \n\nSince March 2023, I have only been employed for a 3 month contract and moved back to my home state. I have been trying since November to find a job closer to my field with no luck. Recently, I started trying to find literally any job. I thought I had a job as an Amazon driver, but I was rejected because I got two tickets in the last year (the only 2 tickets I've ever had.) I had an interview today for a warehouse job, but I thought I was told on the phone they'd offer it to me if the interview went well, and then all they said was \"we'll be in touch, check your email.\" The interviewer's body language also was also seemingly not interested, which gives me a bad outlook. I don't technically know yet, but I don't have any hopes it'll work out. \n\nI have bills to pay, I don't have a place to live, (I live with my cousin and aunt) and nobody around me understands that I literally cannot find a job. (My cousin thinks I must be doing something wrong in interviews or something, but he's a lawyer and hasn't had to find a job since he was in highschool, outside of his current one. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, but things just aren't working no matter what I do.) I don't know what to do. I have $10k in debt just from moving to and from the job I lost, and I have no way to pay it. \n\nI hate my life, I wish I had never moved, I wish I had a different education or just none at all. I ruined my life, I hate my life, and there is literally nothing I can do about it. My life hasn't improved at all over the past year, it's only getting worse and there's no end in sight. Forget getting back to my dream job, I can't even get hired doing nothing.\n\nEdit: Since so many asked, I got fired from a forensic scientist job. It was my fault, but I also feel like my leadership left me out to dry. My chances at getting another one are slim at this point because they don't want me to be a liability to them. I'm still trying, but I am also trying to find something lab based/adjacent, so that maybe I can prove that I can be trusted in a similar field.\n\nEdit 2: I don't bring up that I was fired in regular interviews unless directly asked. I am still applying for the forensic field in addition, in hopes my dreams aren't over, but I cannot lie there. Governments do extensive background checks and the worst thing you can be to them is a liar.\n\nEdit 3: Law enforcement related positions often require a polygraph exam after you provide background information about yourself, often times directly asking if you were ever fired. I know it's dumb, I don't control it. I, personally, am not a good enough liar to beat a polygraph exam. If it gets to that point, I have to disclose it. I am not really concerned with what they find in a database. I know this is Reddit and \"polygraphs bullshit\" and all that. You act like I have any say in the matter. I can refuse, but then I just will simply be dropped from contention.\n\nEdit 4 (Last edit:) For those who don't know or aren't reading, we literally had a routine ethics meeting (prior to me being fired,) where we discussed someone who got fired for lying on her application. She said she had taken a required class when she hadn't. She got an interview, disclosed she hadn't taken the class, but said she would. She was hired, took the class, then someone else found out and fired her because she misrepresented herself on her application. In this field of work, I cannot lie. As stated before, I don't volunteer the information, but I am not going to lie if I am directly asked because it can and very well might come back to bite me. It is worse to lie about it. For non-industry jobs, I haven't mentioned it at all and I will look into a different excuse for those places, if I am asked in the future. \n\nThank you for all your replies, I can't get to everyone, but I have tried to share information where I can. I know I'll be ok in the end, it's just been really hard and I reached a bit of a breaking point yesterday.

Couldn't get a job. Didn't really know what I wanted to do. Slowly lost all motivation for life and society as I gained some real life experience and saw the world for what it was.

Every day I constantly see lay offs in tech. How AI is replacing jobs. How graduates can't get jobs.\n\nIt's so obvious to me that we need UBI structures put in place now. Even if the starting amount was low. So many jobs are redundant, but people don't want to accept it. Even my lecturers are for the most part redundant, I just learn everything from online material. Yet, instead of accepting we need to change the structure of the economy, they come up with ways to force us to go to lectures, like capturing our attendance. So many jobs are \"nothing\" jobs. Shifting paper around to other people who shift paper around. Nothing is created. The physical jobs like nursing are the ones that have most value at the moment. Tech and STEM skills are becoming more and more automated by the day. Most people can't get meaningful jobs anymore.

It's been a wild ride, not gonna lie. But let's chat about something that's been buzzing in my brain: the changing work ethic among us young'uns.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, it's not about being lazy. We're all about getting creative and making things happen, but the old 9-to-5 grind? Not so much. It's like everyone's waking up realizing there's more to life than the daily commute and water cooler gossip.\n\nAnd sure, the traditional advice for living off the grid says grow your own veggies, maybe rear some chickens. But here's the twist \u2013 not everyone's cut out to be a farmer. What if I told you there's another way? Enter the world of home manufacturing \u2013 yeah, I'm talking 3D printers, CNC machines, the works. We're crafting, we're creating, we're selling \u2013 all from the comfort of our homes.\n\nIt's a whole new ball game, folks. We're not just surviving; we're thriving, crafting our path, one printed part at a time. Who knew the road to self-sufficiency could look so... digital?\n\nSo, what's your take? Are we witnessing the dawn of a new work revolution, or is everyone just dreaming in HD?\n\nAnd that's why I wanna spill the beans on an idea that evolved from a humble business venture to potentially something grander \u2013 a movement, if you will. I'm talking about a renaissance of production right here in the USA. Imagine this: bringing jobs and opportunities back home for those who crave them, while offering a path of self-sustainability for the rest. By fostering a community where trading, selling, and buying parts isn't just transactional but a cornerstone of our economy, we could genuinely see a bloom in innovation and creativity.\n\nNow, I'll be the first to admit, this is a hefty dream, and I'm not decked out in rose-colored glasses thinking I'll revolutionize the world overnight. But hey, chasing dreams is what makes life spicy, right? Plus, I'm here selling [multi-axis customized, small-form, desktop-sized CNC machines](https://craftynub.com/) \u2013 affordable, too, if I may add, these are perfect for making parts for etsy sellers, or heck yet, resell the machines to the etsy sellers for double the prices with your own brand on it. This isn't just about profit; it's about laying the groundwork for a future where we all have a stake in creating and innovating.\n\nAnd yeah, when I tossed this idea into the r/CNC subreddit, let's just say it wasn't all thumbs up and high-fives. Got blasted harder than a sandblaster on a rusty fender. But guess what?

I thought it was right because we only have posts about unemployment, so I want to add a positive experience of finding jobs. \n\nI majored in anthropology because I wanted to be an archaeologist. To do so, you have to attend a Field School. Through your University, you travel somewhere, usually during summer, to work on an ongoing excavation and learn field techniques. However, Field Schools worldwide got cancelled for two summers in a row thanks to COVID. Like many other people in the field sciences, I had to take fewer classes per semester to elongate my undergrad so that I could attend a field school. It is impossible to get hired without one. I figured that I didn\u2019t want to waste time, so I had to gain experience while waiting for lockdown to end. I volunteered at a local museum. They had just gotten a box of archaeological artifacts from a local dig, and they offered to let me catalog them. A few months after that, I applied to an internship at a larger museum. I was accepted because of my volunteering experience. Finally, when lockdown ended, I got to travel to Italy to excavate an Etruscan tomb and a medieval castle, which was one of the best experiences of my life. I came back, went back to my internship, and graduated six months later in December of 2022. My grades weren\u2019t that good. I had a 2.9 GPA. Immediately, I started applying for work. I think I applied to 11 jobs and got one interview. The interviewer actually told me that my field school might not have prepared me for American archaeology, so my museum experience was crucial. Another factor is that, thanks to the field science bottleneck, I was the first generation of new applicant after COVID. She hired me, I moved to a new city, and started my current job. I make $17 an hour with benefits, so not much, but it\u2019s enough to live comfortably. My one year review is coming up, and I expect to get a raise. I\u2019ve been getting back into my hobbies (ice skating and archery). Yesterday I went on a second date with a guy I really like, today I adopted a beautiful calico cat, and overall I just feel really good. Just wanted to change the tone of this sub, and perhaps provide an example of how to get a job.

I worked in corporate America for the last 8 years, and one problem I ran into multiple times with multiple different managers was that certain people simply refused to provide clear instructions on how to complete a task.  It seems that there are some people who outright refuse to give clear, specific instructions on how to do something, as they prefer to have you attempt the task multiple times and then slowly reveal whether or not they like your deliverables using ambiguous language.  Many of them have this air that they want you to read their minds instead of just telling the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of a task, and they are under the impression that building this interpersonal relationship where you \u201cfeel the other person out\u201d is a valid way of working.\n\nPersonally, I have no respect or empathy whatsoever for these people.  I can\u2019t read your mind.  I speak three languages; \u201cthe air\u201d is not one of them.  If you want me to do something a certain way, then speak English and tell me what you want.  What I am asking for is not hard, and it should not be hard for anybody.  It seems to me like this is a symptom of extraordinarily poor communication skills, and I\u2019m not really sure why anybody with communication skills this poor would expect me to respect their authority.  One of the things my friend suggested over dinner was that they may not state what they want clearly because they themselves do not know exactly what they want.  In that case, why should I be expected to trust that person\u2019s vision for the project?\n\nAfter 8 years in corporate America, I decided to take a sabbatical.  I quit my job, moved to a foreign country (Asia Pacific Region) and picked up a job teaching English to make ends meet - something I\u2019ve done before and I feel like I\u2019m doing okay at so far.  On Friday, my boss wanted me to film some marketing materials for the school, and I ran into this problem.  He refused to provide a script for me to read, refused to provide notes on my performance, and refused to provide clear cut instructions about what he did and did not like about the performance.  He kept giving extremely vague instructions, and just tried to show me examples of what another teacher (his favorite employee) had done and said \u201cjust do something like this.\u201d  I told him he needed to be more specific than that.  He outwardly grimaced, and said \u201cyou just need more practice and we just need to spend more time together so you can get to know me better.\u201d\n\nNo, I don\u2019t.  What I am asking for is not that hard.\n\nAs I continued to push the issue, he continued to get visibly frustrated.  The meeting did not end on a positive note.  \n\nCONTEXT:\n1) No, the language barrier is not part of the problem here.\n2) My friend mentioned that this is common in Asia, at least in his experience, but the reason why I\u2019m posting here is because this was a serious problem for me all throughout my time in corporate America (the problem here is not specific to one culture - it\u2019s universal to a certain type of manager that thinks this is acceptable because of their own poor communication skills). \n\nWhile I am on sabbatical, I am trying to reflect on these challenges from my time in corporate and heal and grow so I can come back stronger.\n\nCan you share your thoughts?", "title": "\u201cReading the Air\u201d", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bb3tw4/reading_the_air/"}, {"author": "Eskitz", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1710052312.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "1bb3mxz", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": true, "link_flair_template_id": "86ad96b6-74fd-11ec-be33-be663bbd396a", "link_flair_text": "Career development", "locked": false, "name": "t3_1bb3mxz", "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/1bb3mxz/i_m17_want_to_practice_law_or_do_some_sort_of_law/", "saved": false, "score": 1, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "Hello, I am a junior in High school currently but I currently have already been offered a full ride scholarship to one of the big universities in my state.

As my bouts of crying and sense of helplessness has been prolonged past 4 months, the doctor has preliminarily diagnosed me with burnout. \n\nToday I woke up at 6am and started crying when my mind ruminated the meeting. \n\nCan someone please tell me if this is normal? Why are the ones that work the hardest and burntout always labeled as toxic? I can't control my outbursts and I've never been like that in previous jobs. \n\n", "title": "Burntout at work but boss marked my symptoms as being toxic ", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bak34k/burntout_at_work_but_boss_marked_my_symptoms_as/"}, {"author": "Trying_ToDo_Betterr", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1710028553.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "1baw4th", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": true, "link_flair_template_id": "dc491ca2-05ab-11e6-97de-0ec36f9f170d", "link_flair_text": "Interviews", "locked": false, "name": "t3_1baw4th", "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/1baw4th/sei_investment_management_services_tech_intern/", "saved": false, "score": 2, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "I will be interviewing at SEI, specifically within the Investment Management Services Tech team.

I want to get a \"yes\" from 2nd, but don't want to burn bridges with 1st as my backup. \n\nIf I'm offered the position at the 1st place, should I delay? Should I tell the second place that I have another offer but prefer them? Should I sign the letter of intent with the 1st place and if 2nd sends an offer sign with them and back out of the 1st?\n\nI'm in the US in at will work state.\n\nThanks!", "title": "Trying to slow down hiring process at one position to hear back from another?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1batvqi/trying_to_slow_down_hiring_process_at_one/"}, {"author": "BigKevo06", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1710021791.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "1batjfj", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": true, "link_flair_template_id": "adfd903c-05b8-11e6-b9a4-0e9a8fb8e6bb", "link_flair_text": "Rejections", "locked": false, "name": "t3_1batjfj", "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/1batjfj/i_feel_like_im_not_getting_jobs_because_of_my/", "saved": false, "score": 1, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "My resume is good but my only two experiences are summer jobs one from last summer and the other from the summer before.

They\u2019ve CC\u2019d me in the lists of students they send to all tutors, so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s no communication.

The form says to add as the employer \u201cthe company who issued your paychecks\u201d, but they *would be* who would issue my paychecks if I were to actually tutor a student. I could give the company info and add it as Self-Employment, but I\u2019m not sure if I should, since I\u2019ve never actually done any work for them and was never issued any paychecks.

I feel like an idiot and am not looking forward to next week.\n\n\n\n", "title": "Struggling with colleagues at new job", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1baihdw/struggling_with_colleagues_at_new_job/"}, {"author": "Outrageous-Ad5969", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1709992709.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "1baibr4", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": true, "link_flair_template_id": "dc491ca2-05ab-11e6-97de-0ec36f9f170d", "link_flair_text": "Interviews", "locked": false, "name": "t3_1baibr4", "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/1baibr4/such_an_odd_interview/", "saved": false, "score": 1, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "I had an interview yesterday for a real estate company (Howard Hanna) for a non agent position.

And then I got a lecture on how Howard Hanna is the best, and if I want to work there I can\u2019t use my (amazing) realtor from Keller Williams anymore and we have to get rid of her. It was so rude. She then said she was going to ask the brokerage themselves if they were hiring full time and if they could hire me if I didn\u2019t want to do her idea?!? I then asked her about splits if I ever did want to be a realtor there and she basically said she wouldn\u2019t tell me bc she didn\u2019t want me to tell my realtor.

My dad does seem concerned with the amount of money my mom is willing to pay but frankly my sister is not good at keeping her side of the house clean or teaching her kids how to do chores so I get to clean if I end up working over there. It is bad (the toilet looks black, there's constantly stuff on the floor such as cereal, food, toys, etc. and generally her side is just messy) and I know it will be a draining job but I guess setting my own hours and being able to visit my family might be worth it.

After an update from my lawyer, I can anticipate waiting another 1-2 years for my application to even get looked at. Being this long without health insurance, as well as all of my other bills, even with help of my family, I\u2019m completely broke after this process.\n\nI went to culinary school in college and enjoyed my job in the kitchen very much. It wasn\u2019t a lot of money but I took pride in my work. It was genuinely fun, at least as fun as work can be. However, I got into an accident (not workplace related) and tore my ACL and needed knee surgery. Returning to work was hard, and only got harder. By the time I left the kitchen, I had lost a lot of weight and my health was in the dumpster. It was a hard decision, but applying for disability allowed my body to recover/get rest from my time working, and it probably saved my life.\n\nHowever, I need to reenter the workforce and I cannot do kitchen work anymore. I\u2019ve been applying to do office/ remote work but I haven\u2019t heard back from a single place or get denied immediately after submitting my applications. I have 5+ years of experience as a hotel front desk, so I genuinely do have office skills like phones, emails, computers, etc., but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. I\u2019ve been admittedly picky with choosing an employer, but health/dental insurance benefits are non-negotiable with me. I\u2019ve done about 40-50 applications with no word back from any one.\n\nI\u2019m desperate and I don\u2019t know what I need to be doing, but I\u2019m on my last $400 and something needs to happen.

The CEO announced our company goals for this coming year, and essentially the role that I was hired to do is no longer relevant to our new goals.

I have done all the stops: reached out to past jobs for positions, reached out posting on social media, and tweaked my application in every way possible and got it advised by a family friend who worked in HR.

I have applied to jobs in my home state NJ and there is still no responses. In the past 6 months I have had 3 interviews, The first was for Juicepress doing visual merchandising and they muted me in the middle of the last round interview with the investors/ceos (ofc a white old dude and some housewife plastic looking lady) and just talked about me while I could not hear and they dismissed me without further questions while then sending me an email saying they are not even going to make a visual merchandiser roll. I am annoyed about either getting offered \"free lance or contract\" positions that do not give me any benefits or getting over worked for 18 bucks an hour - If I can even get that. I have applied to USPS, Fedex, Gov jobs EVERYTHING. Iv'e tried side hustles like selling my art, selling maybe half of my possessions and doing odd jobs for friends and family. I am lucky to be receiving unemployment since I was working a high paying gig but I am loosing motivation to keep on looking and applying because anything that is even up for grabs is under 20 bucks and hour and part time to some capacity.

The manager said that\u2019s a wrap we\u2019ll email or txt you all if you end up making it to the second round interview. Note I didn\u2019t speak just listened to the manager speak.

I don't know if it's right to ask freelance-related questions here.\n \nI could use some advice, as I'm stressed and overwhelmed. I'll first give a background and then share my current situation.\n \n**Background:**\n \nAbout 8 months ago, I started working as a full-time employee for a small company in the US. Unfortunately, I had to resign just before Christmas due to a family emergency (I returned to my home country in Asia, thus ending my US visa).\n \nFrom the get-go, I noticed the working environment was toxic -  micromanagement, abuses, and unrealistic expectations.\n\nDespite this, I stayed because I needed the money, and the US job market was brutal. Days were highly stressful, with management sometimes shockingly rude. \n \nWhen I resigned before Christmas, I was offered to continue working remotely as a freelancer because they liked my work.\n\nDespite not enjoying the environment, I agreed to the proposal and began working as a remote freelancer in early 2024 (from my home country). \n\nBeing new to freelancing, I read many articles on best practices and procedures for contractors and freelancers. My initial request was for a written agreement. I even drafted one and provided it to the CEO and HR for signing three months ago.\n\nDespite my requests, I haven\u2019t received a written agreement for this freelance work, though I\u2019ve been invoicing them weekly. \n\nI know this is my fault, and I feel like an idiot for not having a written contract for freelancing. I've been consistently reminding them about it, but despite my efforts, none of us have signed a written agreement.\n \nAs I had been receiving regular payments for my freelance work, I didn't feel a sense of urgency in finalizing the written agreement. Looking back, I realize it was not wise to think this way.\n \n**Current Situation:**\n \nWorking remotely for 3 months now, and things have only gotten worse. Projects lack direction, deadlines are unrealistic, and there\u2019s a blame-game culture among colleagues. I've been unfairly criticized in meetings, and even the CEO\u2019s daily meetings include personal attacks and expletive curse words. At this point, it's starting to affect my health. \n \nI hope you guys can advise me on these questions:\n \n- Is it legal for me to resign from this freelance gig immediately without notice?\n\n- Hypothetically, even if there\u2019s a signed agreement, can I still resign immediately, and would an email suffice as written notice?\n\n- As I wrote before, I drafted a written agreement and sent it to them for signature, but it remains unsigned. I used standard terms from a template, and I included this under the termination clause:\n\n\"Both parties may terminate this agreement at any time, for any reason, by providing written notice to the other party.\"\n\n- Additionally, there's an NDA in my written agreement, stipulating that the work I do belongs to the client. I retained this NDA from my full-time offer when I started in the US.\n\nI've been considering quitting this job every single day, but I've hesitated for the following main reasons:\n\n- If I quit without a written agreement, how do I list this freelance job on my resume or verify it for future employers without a written agreement?\n\n- I\u2019ve also planned to apply for work visas in other foreign countries, where the government requires proof of past employments. I don't know how to verify this freelance work without an agreement. Once I leave, I'm certain nobody in the company will verify my employment.\n\n- I've kept records of all the invoices I've issued to the company, along with emails from my bank showing the receipt of international payments. However, I'm unsure if these documents are sufficient proof for potential employers.\n \nMy main concern here is the lack of written agreement, which could impact my future employment opportunities. Since I'm not in the US, I'm not concerned about filing for unemployment.\n \n- Could there be legal consequences for quitting without notice, such as getting sued by the CEO for any possible reason?\n \nSorry again for these dumb questions.

At first I was a functional addict but over the past 3 years opiates (specifically dope/fent) took over my life.

It gets a lot of hate and I am under no illusion it will be easy to stop but it really is enabling me put my life back together. But because of this I am attending bi-weekly appointments that will eventually be monthly. How would I explain this to an employer? I have to attend the appointments in person because of a drug test so zoom, teams, etc. is not possible. Should I wait until I get moved to monthly appointments? It might be easier to explain monthly appointments versus bi-weekly.\n\nAny tips as to how I should approach the job market? I went to school for political science but did not go to law school or pursue any further graduate studies so finding a job that is in my field (and interesting) can be difficult. During my functional days I held a variety of jobs. Worked for a startup which I loved, supervisor at a Starbucks, and in client relations that had some overlap with customer service. I no longer want to be dishonest - did it plenty in the past, especially with doctors - but also am unsure how open I should be about my addictions. I suppose I could blame the pandemic a bit as I have a chronic illness (though not that serious) and my fianc\u00e9e has one as well (hers is a lot more serious).

I have a coworker who is one of the laziest workers I have ever seen in my life. I work a government job but we are contractors, not government employees. It's administrative work and it isn't hard to do. It interests me a great deal because I enjoy the industry the work falls in, and it's a beautiful location, and I'm just overall a great fan. Anyway. I put a lot of effort and pride in the work I do for this job. My coworker, on the other hand, does not. We started the same day. Learned the same things on the same dates, had the same amount of training, etc. She comes in at least 30 minutes late on a daily basis, but usually closer to 1-2 hours. She then sits in her cubicle on her phone, spends another hour doing her hair and makeup, then goes to the bathroom for 20-35 minutes. Comes back, signs on for about 30 minutes. Then lets her screen go blank and sits there on her phone. Every restroom break is at least 20 minutes. (I go for 7 and feel like it was ages) On top of that, she will go for 30 minutes before lunch and say 'I'm going to the restroom before lunch.' be gone for that long and come back, have the audacity to say she's going to lunch. Then takes a 1.5 hour lunch! On top of being an hour late. OMG. We do reports, are contact points for several firms, I have 7 to handle and she has 6. We do weekly and monthly reports. Each month I complete my reports and get them back from my firms while she struggles to even get them started. I feel a lot of stress about this because I like this person apart from work. She is sweet and relatable. And so kind. But her work ethic drives me INSANE. And I can't stop letting it. Her work is separate from mine, but her firms' contact points come to me for assistance, especially if it's urgent, because my coworker will say she is going to do something, something that would take me no more than 30 minutes to complete, and then a week later we get a follow up email requesting it be done, *again,* because she hasn't done it. I feel weird because we do the same exact thing, but for different companies. When we started I felt like I had more drive and initiative to get things done in a timely manner, I started to do everything and didn't give her a chance. We've even had this conversation before because we both felt that way. I started making opportunities for her to do things and would wait 2-3 days for a task that takes me 10 minutes and is the key to completing multiple other tasks, and it wouldn't be done. I'd have to do it myself. So I continue to take on most tasks. But I can't get over the stress of the fact she does nothing. I feel like in some way I don't want her to get in trouble, because she's my buddy, but at the same time, I pray for the day she does get in trouble. I just don't know how to stop obsessing over it.

The new owner said all the right things in early interactions which lead me to believe he could fix the issues from previous ownership to help get the business to the next level.\n\nSince the change occurred I had to renegotiate my pay and salary status to a lower hourly wage. The owner was disrespectful of my time and overworked me to a degree which in my opinion was unnecessary due to the seasonal nature of the business. They also did not respect any of my experience and in almost every instance disagreed with my input. I was previously in charge of recipe development which has completely been taken over by the new owner and resulted in sub par offerings that would not have met previous standards.\n\nAfter a month or so of butting heads on the direction of the business/menu/schedule etc. my full time schedule was abruptly cut from 44+ hours a week to zero the night before a new work week. The previously overbearing owner was suddenly very quiet and for nearly 3 weeks has given me no clarity on whether I will work there again despite my active employment status.\n\nI am trying to move on but I gave so much of myself to this business and made connections and recipes that the new owner will be at least trying to continue and benefit from in my absence.\n\nWould it be a mistake to publicize this?

He quit for his mental health as, AFAIK, a certain Mr. Very Important just didn't like him and demanded his peons f--- with him repeatedly.\n\nThis new guy, not only is he a hoarder (I can't WAIT for the fire chief to come this July) but if he sees you -- literally, you come within his view, you are questioned as to what you are doing and have to give a full account of 1. why you are here 2. why you WERE here any time in the past 4 hours and what you were doing THEN, and 3. there's a 50/50 chance he'll disbelieve you and reassign you anyway. He doesn't SAY you're lying, he just says \"well, we need you to move this furniture\" even if you left all of your things on the other side of the gigantic workplace and need to put them away.  So I feel like I'm playing Assassin's Creed or something, it's so silly.\n\nExample from the other day: He had JUST assigned me in person to work on work tickets, had JUST added a ticket for replacing lightbulbs not 40 minutes prior, something way below my skillset but that's a whole 'nother conversation, and I told him I was going to tackle it.  And lo and behold, I have to walk down past his office to something called the lightbulb room, as his office door faces an important artery in the building, whilst I'm carrying an F32T8 (very large obvious light bulb) to make sure I was retrieving the right replacement. My coworker and I both actively avoid this T juncture by walking outside, way out of our way. He KNOWS this. He must, as we just disappear and never use it because of his interrogations. But I was thinking, no way, he just affirmed my assignment, surely it won't happen. But I get stopped. He says, like he always does, \"\\[Naaame\\], sooo... what're we working on today???\" in a tone, prior to meeting him, I assumed was reserved for very young, mentally challenged toddlers, those coming out of anesthesia, or lobotomy patients.  It's like everyone has to do this song and dance to make sure he knows HE's in charge, HE's so smart, and it's infuriating. I am so close to asking him what country he's the king of because he's been sitting on his ass for the last 6 hours while I've been, say, elbow deep in feces helping to mount toilets, so it must be a royal pronoun. I am the only female in my department but he does it to everyone, although particularly, it seems, me -- though I'm a \"weirdo\" who, unlike everyone else, likes to use my telescope and stargaze, play tabletop games and bike ride instead of getting wasted after work. The only way I can get him to stop is to somehow bring up gender. He is terrified of Title IX.  But that's it.\n\nEverybody keeps telling me to go to HR, but my coworker did (what specifically, I am not sure, he was so mad he couldn't talk), and they dug up a minor, informal complaint made months prior to get him fired: it made stuff worse for him.  Everything is such a small slight, I can't properly convey it in a notarized document.  How do you **prove** someone has a tone that is just dripping with condescension? We're a single-party state, but I cannot imagine secret recordings I've hidden away for months would be appropriate and wouldn't result in some major reprimand.\n\n**I guess I'm asking, how unusual is a situation where you work in an environment that is so fake to appease the higher-ups' egoes that it, at times, approaches Poe's law in its levels of ridiculousness? How the f--- can someone not only be aware that coworkers actively cringe at his sight and are constantly avoiding him, but seemingly revel in it instead of, I dunno, taking a huge step back and reevaluating his life decisions?** I can't get a new job, long story.  The HR guy, I cannot tell you how many times I walk in and can hear them joking around with eachother, so they're best buds. But as soon as one of us, \"the help\" enters the room, it's like a sterile cockpit, where not even the funniest of (non-vulgar) jokes will even get a polite smile?  Just an expectant, \"Why-aren't-you-talking-about-work\" angry gaze? But I personally confirmed half these \"important\" peoples' jobs wouldn't even exist if it weren't for a certain Mr. Very Important accommodating one of the good ol' boys after surgery, etc.  Like, their title didn't exist, description is repetitive, convoluted, nonsensical and/or is a duplicate and falls under the jurisdiction of multiple already-filled positions, wayback machine shows it not even being publicly posted before position is miraculously filled, coincidentally by his son-in-law, etc. He holds multiple positions, at least one within: law enforcement, local government, AND my company, a major area employer.

It raises important considerations regarding leadership, experience, and societal perceptions.\n\nOn one hand, age can bring a wealth of experience and wisdom. An 81-year-old president likely has a long history of navigating various challenges, which can contribute to effective decision-making and leadership. This experience may be especially valuable in addressing complex issues that require a deep understanding of historical context and nuanced perspectives.\n\nHowever, the concern about ageism is valid. In a society where ageism exists, there may be preconceived notions about older individuals' capabilities, adaptability, and understanding of contemporary issues. Ageism can potentially hinder the public's trust in a leader, creating skepticism about their ability to relate to and address the concerns of a diverse and rapidly changing society.\n\nIt's essential to evaluate candidates based on their individual qualities, health, and adaptability rather than making blanket assumptions based on age alone. Leadership should be about competence, vision, and the ability to connect with and represent the interests of the people.\n\nIn conclusion, while age can bring valuable experience, addressing ageism in the context of selecting a president requires a balanced approach. It's crucial to assess candidates holistically, considering their individual qualities and capabilities rather than making sweeping judgments based solely on age. The goal should be to foster a society that values diverse perspectives and recognizes the potential contributions of leaders of all ages.", "title": "What's your thought when it comes to having an 81-year-old president while ageism is running wild in America?", "upvote_ratio": 0.39, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1b9o67x/whats_your_thought_when_it_comes_to_having_an/"}, {"author": "FinalPlankton190", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1709864017.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1709864872.0, "id": "1b9cadv", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": true, "link_flair_template_id": "2713d630-0739-11e6-9530-0eac7e114f67", "link_flair_text": "Unemployment", "locked": false, "name": "t3_1b9cadv", "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/1b9cadv/fired_after_only_3_weeks/", "saved": false, "score": 4, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "Hey everyone I'll try to make this short because it's A LOT to digest but I got a job working in purchasing 3 weeks ago which I disclosed prior to getting hired was the fact that my excel skills were okay but I needed a refresher as it was my sophomore year in college since I used it on a large scale.\n\nGet to the job I go through orientation which was two long grueling days and then I finally get to my job in which I was lost on what to do the manager never came and talked to me so I had to go to the lead and ask what I should do and if I could shadow her in which she said \"I don't like people sitting over the top of me\" so I was like oh okay she taught me the basics and then after that I got 3 days of maybe a hour of training each and after that nothing, no training, no one came to talk to me, no one seemed to want me there anytime I asked questions I was made out to be an idiot.

I figured, that with a few months of experience, I'd surely get accepted into an administrative position, and so I did.\n\nThe interview went well, but I left feeling anxious and defeated for some reason. I landed exactly what I needed, a 9-5 administrative position with good benefits, yet the interview felt weird and I still feel unsatisfied.\n\nWith each new job, I start to lose hope, I really do. At my first few jobs I had a super good mindset, basically a \"new job, new opportunities\" kind of thing. Now, I'm feeling cynical. As almost every single job I had, I only expect toxic coworkers to be present, high workloads, and unappreciative bosses, and I'm not a slacker!\n\nThe interview? Guy was unkept (unprofessional attire + long dirty fingernails), kept telling me to \"chill, you don't need to be nervous\" (I wasn't even nervous), kept looking at his phone when I said something, and lied about the fact that it is mandatory to work a night-shift week every six weeks. I got this job through an agency, and they didn't disclose this on their job post. When I called this out, they didn't know about this at all and told me they'll contact the employer (waiting on what they have to say), so it seems like the interviewer straight up lied because they need more people.\n\nMy thoughts: \"Great... I thought I'll be able to get a nice job, but yet again, there's a bunch of clear signs that this won't be that good.\"\n\nI had a job as a delivery driver which I really enjoyed, and they told me that I could come back. I had a disagreement with my supervisor and he even apologized and begged me to stay. Now my ego is holding me back from doing it, as I left because of unlawful behavior on their part (to which they admitted and apologised for it). I left because it simply didn't match my principles. I got treated unlawfully after doing so much for them (overtime, taking difficult routes/tasks without hesitation, traveling to other cities because of lack of manpower in other facilities, almost never taking sick leave and off days).\n\nI also have my own company, which is earning almost nothing. My main goal in life is to grow as a music producer (my business) just to leave this stupid career bullshit behind. But for now, I do need something to make a living. It's just so damn difficult to find something good without a proper degree. It's like all uneducated jobs are full of toxicity.\n\nWhat can I do to feel good at work? I already checked the boxes of being a good employee, taking care of myself and my sleep and eating habits so that I can work optimally, yet still it's not enough to feel satisfied. I'm a totally different person when at work and I hate it. What I do know is that I either love driving, doing administrative tasks like data input (I love monotonous tasks, don't ask). The work itself is usually not the problem, I worked in a deep-cleaning company where we scrubbed toilets in mental facilities.

Then Covid Started and slow work had to continue for way less hours than normal. As I was a team player I've signed on a paper that I would cover the little amount of hours weekly so they would keep there contracts and I would have the top priority on the schedules when the pandemic would end. Doing that will other people's would get compensation from the government.\n\nPost lock down, The guy that was doing the night shift found a better place so they ask me to replace his shift temporary while they search for someone, I would get my top priority after they find the new worker. I thought it would be for 1-2 months, in insight I should have not comply but I was still a team player. Each 2 weeks I would ask them where they are in the search of the new worker, they would tell me soon, soon.\n\n2 Years later, still filling the night schedule but my work load as triple in size and there as been a couple of bump in the road, as exemple they want me not to talk to the clients, some task are half written on paper with a bunch of things missing. But I've been ask to do as been told and can't ask the client because I'm not allowed to talk to them. So there is a lot of complains. I've stop working for 3 peoples and started working as 1 person. Suddenly because 2/3 of the work wasn't done they managed to find someone in a couple of weeks. But sadly because they already filled all the other positions, they can't fulfill the written document with there signature.\n\nThey managed to find a lot of new workers that would work for a month or 2 before quitting, because it was to much work. Meanwhile I was doing a lot of different works without having what I was promised. At the end, they asked me to fill the position until they could find someone, I told them I would cover for 3 months and if they don't find anyone I would just quit on the spot. So I got my saving prep and everything so It wouldn't be that hard. Almost after 2-1/2 month I got a serious Covid case, I've been told I couldn't take my sick days for that even if I didn't called sick the past 5 years. So I told them I will take days without pay, cause I couldn't work.\n\nAfter I returned from my \"sick leave\" I've heard from a coworker that he had to cover most of my shift and two manager had to cover the rest. Later on I had an issue with one of the manager that told me he had to cover my shift alone and it was easy, even if I knew they were 3 peoples covering the shift. So I told him : If that's easy, you don't mind doing it in my place\" and quitted.\n\n**Job Search :** Not gonna lie job search was hard, I feel what help me a lot is calling the company I was applying to to make sure they had my curriculum and showing an interest in there companies.\n\n**New Job :** After like 3 months of search I've managed to land a new jobs that pays more and that the managers/bosses aren't as toxic. So far I'm really enjoying the new compagnie. \n\n**Ex-coworker :** From a ex-coworker I kept In touch, I managed to find that my last company lost a lot of there contracts shortly after I quitted and that the manager got fired because she was gaslighting all the employees and no one was willing to work for her anymore.", "title": "Light at the end of the tunnel", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1b92s7t/light_at_the_end_of_the_tunnel/"}, {"author": "thisthe1", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1709859171.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "1b9aid3", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": true, "link_flair_template_id": "e387d468-05ab-11e6-b3df-0e43b37a78c1", "link_flair_text": "Post-interview", "locked": false, "name": "t3_1b9aid3", "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/1b9aid3/how_do_i_ask_a_job_to_hurry_with_an_offer/", "saved": false, "score": 1, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "It's crunch time folks!

I have the academic knowledge but my work experience is way off since none of the internships that I have completed are related to marketing field which is the area that I want to work in. Right now I am trying to find an internship program that I can work in marketing area however no one is willing to hire me as an intern since I'm about to graduate. \n\nI have two options after I graduate A) I will be searching for a job in the marketing area until I find one or B) there is this one company that is willing to hire me right after I graduate but the job is not related to my field at all and people who work for this company work for at least 20 years so your whole life goes to this company ( for context it is a highly reliable company and they pay you well as well asin a timely manner so people stay for the long run)\n\nSo my question is this: what is my deadline to find a job after I graduate? Because when there is a huge space in your CV I know that usually companies somehow find a way to not hire you relating their reason to that gap in your CV ( they say things like you have been far away from work life Etc.)\n\nI feel like my deadline to find a job is August if I don't find an internship until I graduate because my previous work experience ended in last year may so already there is this huge gap in my CV.

When I worked there I literally did extra work for the team (on top of my normal caseload), had people who worked there longer than me asking me for advice, was told by a senior-positioned staff member that they liked working with me because I clearly care and don't do the minimum. Not the first job I've had where I've done extra work and fixed problems that had been there for months/years. But being an agency worker, I was laid off for budget cuts at the bequest of some higher up (a few team members talked to the manager   \n to try to stop it, but to no avail as it wasn't her decision). It's frustrating to effectively be told by Human Resources, via a pre-interview rejection, that they don't think I'm capable of a job so similar to what I've done before.\n\nAnd then the real kicker is when I see people with decent jobs, who somehow lucked into it (yes, we all have luck in life. I'm still lucky compared to many people - eg I didn't earn being alive ahead of people born in warzones or with fatal diseases and I didn't earn my intelligence), whereas other people have to work for years to reach the same position.\n\nIf those people who lucked into it were doing a good job once they got there I'd still be a little annoyed with my situation, but I'd be much more ok with it. But there's a couple jobs I've had where I've struggled hard to get the job, am being paid less than the others and even commuting further than them (due to not finding a job in my own city) - but I get to the workplace and half of the staff are lazy bums who do the bare minimum or people who spend all their day moaning complaining about their job, complaining about the manager or gossiping about colleagues. It's like being in high school.\n\nYet somehow Human Resources let these people into the job, even though they clearly don't have the attitude and work ethic requested in the job description or person specification. Obviously the solution for an individual is to never give up and to learn how to game the recruitment system better, but it's clearly a broken system.\n\nThen you deal with family and wider society assuming you're lazy, unambitious or a bad worker for not having a better job or more money. Applying for jobs is an effort, but it's fine - the feeling of having my character and worthiness as a person unfairly attacked is when it starts to wear me down.\n\nNot sure if this breaks the rules.

When I started, I thought it wasn't so bad. I liked my coworkers and the agents were awesome to work with. As time went on, I noticed toxicity, drama, and bullshit with upper management. 2 of them caused 99% of the stress that we felt. It was a completely toxic environment. My 2 coworkers who were fellow receptionists also felt the tension. Every time Friday rolled around, I dreaded it because I worked weekends. Whenever I would go in, I would get the urge to walk out and go home. I remember one time I asked for Sunday off because of Orthodox Easter. I went to the restroom and when I came out, they were both outside screaming at each other.\n\n In June 2018, I found resumes for my position and I knew then and there they were planning to fire me. Luckily I found my full-time job that I'm at now a few weeks later. I left July 2018, but I still worked the weekends because the person who was supposed to replace me never showed. Luckily, someone called and said they sent their resume. I let my boss know and they hired her. By that time I was already at my new job and absolutely burnt out waiting for a new hire to start so I can train them. Since I left, I would hear that when new people would start, they didn't last very long. Also, soon after I left, one of the upper management left to work at our sister office in another location and the other who worked in management became the team leader. I still keep in touch with some agents, and 2 of them invite me to a client BBQ that they host every year.\n\nFast forward to 2020 when people were starting to go back to the office, I was contacted and asked if I could help out on the weekends while they found a new receptionist. The new full-time receptionist was there and told me she was quitting because she couldnt take working there and it was affecting her health. I said ok and was there for a few weeks, but I had to stop because it was too much for me in addition to working full-time. They understood thankfully.\n\nFast forward again to 2024, I get a text from my old coworker who is now an agent asking me if I would be willing to come back. My coworkers know that I've been looking for a higher paying job for a long time now. I've been on interviews, but no luck. The job pays in the low $40,000's which is not a lot. I told him I'll send over my resume, but I'm not promising anything. When they called me for an interview, I was not excited at all. I got a sinking feeling in my stomach.  My coworkers told me that the former management who became team leader got fired, and hired a new one who is much nicer and it's not a toxic environment anymore....but I still have my doubts. I have an interview on Tuesday. I'm going to ask of they offer any benefits such as health insurance. If they don't, I'm not accepting the job. For membere who are outside the US, our health insurance is offered through our jobs. \n\nThis job is closer to my house. My commute home currently is almost 2 hours. \n\nI told my parents about this opportunity. My dad says it's not worth it because of the salary, and to stay where I am until something better comes along. My mom says to go for it and to stop thinking about the past and making it negative. \n\nI don't know about this. I'm applying to other companies that pay more, but it is hard trying to find something. I want to move forward, and I feel like I'm going backwards. \n\nI really need advice on this.
