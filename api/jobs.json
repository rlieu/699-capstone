I made a post a couple of days ago detailing how my boss chewed me out over getting help from a coworker. After that day, I thought everything was said and done till the next morning when my boss once again called me into his office.\n\nHe accused me having coworkers in MY office (like, why am I getting in trouble? I didn\u2019t invite them, and regardless I have an open door policy and love to help and answer questions where I can. Also, I was leaving in about a week, so people would often stop and talk or say goodbye) for FOUR HOURS. If anything, the few coworkers who DID stop by were there for 10-15 minutes at most, and would stop by from time to time for various reasons.\n\nThen, after I tried to reason and defend myself and my coworkers, he cut me off and told me it looked bad on me and that upper management had made comments. After that, he said something that absolutely shocked me: \u201cyou know, we didn\u2019t have to keep you after you put in your two weeks. But we vouched for you.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind, the only reason I put in two weeks to begin with is because its the professional thing to do. I have another job lined up. I would have loved to just quit lol. This was the bullshit I was tired of.\n\nI was shocked and nearly in tears. There was another person in his office awkwardly sitting there. I was overall just humiliated. After I left his office I cried a bit in my own office and packed all my belongings because I was debating walking out.\n\nI thought about it over the weekend and decided I would just flat out quit on Monday morning, which I did. \n\nHe was shocked? How can you be shocked after lowkey waving the threat of being fired around?\n\nEither way, I\u2019m glad to be out.

It paid about the same as I was making before being laid off, which translates to a loss when you factor in the long commute and office time. I agonized over whether I should wait for something better to come along, but they gave me only two days to decide on the offer (and refused to extend more time) and wanted me to start within the week. It was an offer and I've been unemployed for months, so even though they wouldn't negotiate on the salary, I accepted the job and started last Friday.\n\nHere's where the trouble started. On Friday afternoon, after a welcome lunch bought by my new colleagues, I got a call from a company I had interviewed with weeks before and had assumed I was no longer under consideration for. They offered me the job (same title) at a higher salary, and fully remote. I think it's a better fit for my skills and certainly for my lifestyle. It's a no brainer for me to accept.\n\nBut now I'm going to have to quit on my third day on the job at the first company. It's an extremely small company (5 people) and I'm their first hire who they haven't had a prior relationship with. They're all extremely nice and have been so kind and welcoming. I know I'm putting them in a bad position, as they hired me so quickly because they're extremely busy, and they wasted time and money hiring and onboarding me. I am in a 90 day probationary period where I'm able to quit or be terminated without notice, so technically I'm in the clear, but morally I feel awful about it and I'm worried about what the consequences might be for future job searches.\n\nThe time after my layoff has been the worst in my life and this is really just adding another layer of awfulness. I know I have to do what's best for me in the end but just hoping to maybe hear some reassurance that I'm making the right decision. I've never actually had to quit before, the company that laid me off was my first adult job. Any advice on how to do so gracefully in this situation without making things even worse?

I tell her that I love photography and am new to this city and have heard that this company is amazing to work for. She proceeds to tell me that my resume is catered for a graphic designer (that\u2019s where my experience has been) and almost got flagged out of their system, but she saw it and looked at my portfolio and \u201cit\u2019s amazing!\u201d\nI\u2019m feeling good about this, but then she proceeds to let me know that I\u2019m not really a fit for this role and that I\u2019m more suited for a design role.

In total, there are six of us: three employees, two interns, and our manager. My role is quite interesting, I am paid very well, and it provides valuable experience for my CV.\n\nHowever, my manager epitomizes a micromanaging boss! As I write this, he could be looking over my shoulder - no joke.\n\nHe is in his early 60s (just for some context, I am in my mid-30s) and is one of those old-school individuals who arrives at work at 8 AM and doesn't leave until 6-7 PM (sometimes I go out to walk the dog and I still see the light in his office switched on, LOL).\n\nMy employer has a policy in place for working from home, allowing us to work remotely for two days. In my first week, he subtly pressured me to only work from home for one day, but I addressed the issue and managed to secure two days. Today (Monday) is one of these agreed-upon remote work days, and I stayed at home. However, I have just received a semi-passive-aggressive email from him, questioning why I didn't come to the office this morning. After reminding him that we agreed on Monday and Wednesday as my work-from-home days, he stated that he didn't receive any official email from me, and that our oral agreement isn't valid without an email. In comparison, other teams  have much more flexibility, as long as there is agreement on the days when everyone is in the office. Even then, they exercise a greater level of flexibility.\n\nSpeaking of working from home, he never takes advantage of this option himself, and is present in the office five days a week. He is a workaholic who enjoys spending time in the office. Since his wife does not work, she takes care of household tasks while he is at work (such as taking out the garbage, going to the post office, receiving deliveries, cleaning, etc.), while I live alone and don't have the luxury to delegate such responsibilities. As a result I do these tasks during the weekend and I always end up feeling dreadful.\n\nHe wants to know every detail about what I (and the rest of the team) do on a daily basis. He frequently comes into my office to inquire about my current tasks. He insists on being CC'd in every email and rarely use MS Teams (preferring to communicate via email, even for minor and insignificant matters).\n\nAnother example occurred last week, when I produced 40 content pieces/files and sent them to him. One of the files had a spelling mistake in its name. He took a screenshot of the file name and asked me to rename it, which came about two hours after he had asked me to prioritize another task.\n\nIt would literally take him 2 secs to rename the file, instead he opted to do a screenshot, crop it, upload it and send it via email. What a complete waste of time!\n\nWe have weekly one-on-one catch-up meetings scheduled for 30 minutes, but they typically last between 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes.\n\nThe rest of the team feels the same way, and when we have rare moments alone, everyone expresses their frustration with our manager. However, they have learned to tolerate the micromanagement as they are content with the generous salary and other benefits.\n\nTo be very honest, he is an incredibly smart and eloquent person with a tone of relevant experience (he started our as a journalist for the Economist and NYT, and later switched to international affairs), speaks 3 languages.... but he is just very uncreative, controlling and lacks proper time management skills for a person of his position. I noticed that even our 2 interns are better managing their time than him!\n\nAs a result of all of this I feel deeply unhappy and I have already started applying to other jobs.\n\nAny tips on how to deal with this would be greatly appreciated.

I need to figure out a way to tell her that I am close to crashing and burning and that I need a big change. I can't really ask to be taken off of the STA because there isn't any work for me to do in my usual area. I really don't want to leave the company but I'm at a point where my mental health is severely impacted. This sucks because I'm generally regarded as a high performer and I really don't want that reputation tarnished, but I also don't want to end up in a psych ward.\n\nAny advice on how to communicate this to her in a professional way? I really try to not overshare at work and I keep my wellbeing and mental health pretty private for the most part so I'm not sure how much detail I should be going into when discussing this with her.
