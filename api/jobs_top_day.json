After several  weeks of phone calls and emails asking for followups, on Wednesday 2/28 I received a call from the VP who is also the hiring manager that he would like to give me the job and asked if I could come into the office to sign the offer. Because I had another interview scheduled for that Friday and was also hoping to hear back from another opportunity I asked him for an emailed offer and if I could have time to make a decision. I felt his tone change and he said in that case he\u2019ll hold off on sending me the offer letter which I thought was odd. I then asked if a week would be an acceptable time frame to respond with my decision to which he said \u201csure, but the sooner the better\u201d which is understandable. We ended the phone call after that, which is when I sent my followup email thanking him and setting March 8th as the agreed upon deadline. Just two hrs later I got my offer rescinded in the email screenshot above.\n\nI was furious lmao. If he wanted a decision in two hours instead of a week he had several opportunities to communicate his expectation on our phone call and after my email, but he completely disregarded my efforts to set up communication with him and rescinded the offer without giving me a chance. I decided to leave a negative Glassdoor interview review because I felt disrespected and did not feel like another conversation with him would lead anywhere because he had already rescinded my offer.\n\nNow I still feel upset, but also some regret and sadness because the job market is so tough right now and I cant help but wonder if I should have handled things differently.

It\u2019s another retail role but this time in a bookshop, which is more in alignment with my longer term goals of getting into heritage publishing.

I drive now, but I\u2019m still a firm believer in going where the work is).\n\nNot sure if this was a rant or a cry for help lol, but it really dampened what should have been a relieving moment for me, and now I feel almost ashamed to have been so excited over a retail job even though I know how valid and demanding this industry is.

When I come across posts regarding someone looking for a new job/complaining about their current one and looking for suggestions there will often be quite a few responses recommending the OP pick up a trade (regardless of the OP's background or goals).\n\nHowever, when the OP expresses no such interest in entering the trades, they are then either slammed as being lazy, entitled, afraid of hard work or told to be \"realistic\" implying that the trades are their only viable career options. This has happened to me a few times too.\n\nHonestly why the hostility? So what if someone isn't interested in blue collar work out of the plethora of potential career paths. No need to demean the inquirer. Come up with another idea and actually listen to the OP instead of throwing the half-assed, rubber-stamp answer \"Dude, go pick up a trade!\" or just simply move on after giving free advice.\n\nThere's a good reason for the labor shortage. Its backbreaking, the pay is grossly exaggerated and its actually fairly complex work. Sure you'll always be in-demand but at an enormous cost to your health and well being. Its funny and disheartening to see posters gloat about getting $25-30 an hour as a tradesman. I made more than that as an intern.\n\nTo those who work in trades and actually enjoy the job and are good at it, awesome!

I\u2019ve been at my job for almost a year. When I first got brought on, I grew our account list by 40% and was hitting 6 figures in sales for my first 4 months. \n\nI do all statewide wholesale sales, social media management and content creation, manage our field marketer, and handle marketing campaigns/concepts. Funny thing is, I don\u2019t even have a management title. \n\nAfter my first 4 months, we lost our head grower and our product quality tanked but our prices stayed the same. 4 months after that, we have another new grower. In the year I\u2019ve been here we haven\u2019t put out a consistent product for more than 3-4 months and have had 4 different people growing our product. \n\nMy boss has begun to micromanage me, and tell me I lack substance and don\u2019t bring enough brain storming on how to increase sales to the table anymore. I\u2019ve been trying to sell low quality product, for a top shelf price. The market has gotten really volatile and my boss has no interest in anything I say. I\u2019ve been begging for months for pricing to get dropped and today he finally said he would do it, after calling out my performance in front of the team. Mind you, he hasn\u2019t been present for a sales meeting in 4 weeks. This is a company that offers one product, and has only offered the same 6 strains of that one product for 2.5 years. There are only so many sales campaigns one can come up with while working with such a small product line. \n\nFrom my POV you need 4 things to have a successful sales person - 1. A consistent, quality product that keeps people coming back and good branding. 2. A price point that people are willing to pay, that aligns with the quality of the product. 3. A good engaged sales person who is seeking out new business and maintaining relationships. 4. A closer. It doesn\u2019t matter how good your sales person is, if the first two aren\u2019t in check it\u2019s a set up for failure and those first two things are things not in my control. \n\nI am so burnt out doing multiple people\u2019s jobs and working for someone who is putting millions of dollars into expanding a company that can\u2019t even produce a consistent product and putting the stress of the success of his business on the shoulders of someone who A. Doesn\u2019t have a management title. B. Has been doing multiple jobs on one salary for almost a year. C. The company doesn\u2019t provide good health insurance, commission structure, company stocks. None of that. \n\nApparently our drop in sales has nothing to do with quality, or pricing (which is crazy cuz it\u2019s weed, those are the only things that matter when someone is buying weed) and all to do with my \u201clack of substance\u201d. I\u2019ve shown him data on why we need to make changes and he hasn\u2019t listened. He doesn\u2019t have a sales or cannabis background, just saw this as an opportunity to make money. \n\nMy performance my first 4 months I clear I can do this job, I haven\u2019t changed the way I do my job all that has changed are things out of my control. Working as a 100% sales person for someone who doesn\u2019t even have a sales background has sucked the life out of me.

The fourth month my supervisor began to start acting funny towards me after giving my opinion on a rude co worker that is her friend. She began to start making little insults towards me. Making smart comments even turning other co workers against me and I can feel the tone in the room when I walk in. Recently I'm January I told her I was pregnant. And a couple of weeks later I was pulled aside by a lead (her friend) and supervisor to tell me I am disrespectful. She said I pop bubble wrap which is a distraction but, others pop bubble wrap and she says nothing to them. She said I am on my phone and others including her self are on their phone and she says nothing. I am not rude to her I only say okay to her when she tells me things. She targets me. So after that day I set up a meeting with hr. After writing a statement I came back in the room and all eves were on me she had to write a statement against me back and included her friends that work there to help her write it. For days the tension was high. After I had a full on meeting with hr. Recently she told another employee not to talk to me. After that day the manager comes in and watches me work. This week another employee took my desk at the computers knowingly it was my seat because it had my personal items at the desk I confronted the other employee and told her she can just sit there and my supervisor laughed.\nUsually if someone set in the wrong seat she would tell them someone sits there. So later that day my manager held a conversation with me and my supervisor in a room saying my language is vulgar when I told him I'm not the only one who curses he dismissed me. Then he told me I'm too social and they want me to stop talking and isolate myself. The last thing the manager brought up was \"I heard you have a letter\" I said yes I'm pregnant and he cut me off and asked what does it say. I said it says to sit as needed. He then asked my supervisor when wast y end date for my accommodations. I was crying and in tears because my supervisor plays innocent to what she does to me even other employees see it that she picks on me. So today went to hr again to give the hr lady my accommodations. She says i don't know if we can accommodate you sitting. The note says when needed.\nThere are other employees who always sit every day.
