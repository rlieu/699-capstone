I've been blessed with some great opportunities in aerospace manufacturing throughout college co-ops, but always yearning for design work I pushed to be given cad liscences so I could design tooling and shop aids for manufacturing. With more and more trust gifted to me I was given opportunity to design tooling which was recieved well enough to be manufactured and used in production which brought me great joy. After my graduating, I was able to secure a role as a tool designer at the company I had my second co-op at. After about 6 months I was recruited through word of mouth by a cutting tool company who paid me really well and gave me lots of freedom to design solutions for them.

I'm currently working in the Bay Area with a specialization in imaging systems, which consists of optics, image processing, and camera manufacturing.  I have both a BSEE and MSEE, where the MSEE specialized in optics and imaging.  I've been the imaging industry for about 8 years, and have been in the Bay Area since 2013.  Also, I'm 35 years old.\\n\\nNow for my questions.\\n\\nI'm basically locked into a very niche area, which is imaging optics.  It's too specific and there isn't enough day to day work to keep me busy, and the industry is primarily high tech in Silicon Valley.  So I'm in a very small field, in a very geographically isolated and expensive area.  Given that the work is limited, and the cost of living in the Bay Area is atrociously high (with no sign of slowing down), I'm looking for a career change to broaden my opportunities outside of Silicon Valley.  The field of imaging is practically non-existent outside of a handful of Silicon Valley companies (and a few in the Seattle area).  \\n \\nGiven the considerations listed above, I'd like to go into another field that is more related to my EE roots, and I've been thinking about RF engineering (among other paths) due to the solid EE nature of the field.  Anybody working in the RF field?  Any advice on considering this path?\"", "title": "8 years in to a specialty, too focused and want to switch", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringCareers/comments/a0dbkm/8_years_in_to_a_specialty_too_focused_and_want_to/"}, {"author": "Arcadia_X", "created_utc": 1522025024.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "87555i", "score": 1, "subreddit": "EngineeringCareers", "text": "\"So to preface this, I\\u2019m a junior in High school and for college I\\u2019m looking into a possible career in engineering.

Anyone who needs to join the workforce must have some experience before they become a part of corporate crowd. But how can you have experience for something that is being taught to you in class theoretically but least significance is given to practical application of what is being taught. A practical work backdrop has huge significance as you are trying to get into job market. It is more about the cutthroat competition that is existent in all parts of the world. It is not only businesses that are standing against each other need an edge but also professionals working in same field.\\n\\nEven the best friend who graduated with you will turn into a stiff competition for being in same market with you. So, where should you look for gaining experience even before you are paid for earning some. The simplest way is to go for internships. It is for this reason, all engineering colleges in India have mandated professional internship for graduating students. There are several benefits of joining a firm as an intern, for engineering students it can make a huge difference in winning or losing a job opportunity. Here are some more add ons to this argument:\\n\\nFirstly, a good internship session opens you up to excellent exposure and reality of market. You will get to know how real world is different from the world of books. You will harness some knowledge, skills and how to deal with everyday problems. It will teach you the challenges that are presently harassing the complete market. Every new thing that you learn in this aspect will be highly useful and worth treasuring for a lifetime. There are so many people out there who stuck with their regular routines, need to stick to their town and attend the same things again and again. An internship can easily take you to new places and help you meet new people. An internship exposes you to a more stable and controlled atmosphere that helps one understand dynamics of market and profession.\\n\\nThe experience you gain while working as an intern helps shaping your professional opinions about things. It will encourage your personal growth and development proving a stepping stone for the professional inside you. It will expose you to the ins and outs of the world you will be working in  and explore what kind of career lines are available for a person of your kind. \\n\\nA good internship experience would also help in building your network  and getting in touch with other professionals in your line of work. You may give a counter argument by attending a networking event eliminating the need for internship, but it would severely restrict your chances of personally interacting with others. Participation in an internship would allow in establishing more personal relationships than the ones that will be formed at an event. Internships also provide one with multiple opportunities for building connections with professionals that can really benefit your career in coming years. \\n\\nLastly, a job interview may provide you with chances for facing someone one-to-one but your resume will be devoid of that chance. An internship with some good firm can always provide you with some perks over those who never had the chance to do that. It can also land you an interview in your dream firm which otherwise wouldn\\u2019t be possible. \\nURL - http://www.mitaoe.ac.in\"", "title": "Understanding The Significance Of Internship For Engineering Students | MITAOE", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringCareers/comments/82m9b7/understanding_the_significance_of_internship_for/"}, {"author": "Suzuki4Life", "created_utc": 1519433007.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 0, "post_id": "7zszz5", "score": 2, "subreddit": "EngineeringCareers", "text": "\"I was recently laid off of my engineering job.
