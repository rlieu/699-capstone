This referral was made after I spent a week in the psych ward because the pain was so bad I was prepared to kill myself, but went to the ER instead.

I wouldn't even promise my wife that I wouldn't kill myself until I knew how the pain management appointment would go. \\n\\nAnyways, the question at the center of this is- if I had specifically written in my suicide note that I was killing myself in large part due to the fact that the pain management would not do anything to help me with my pain even though they knew I was on the brink of a suicide, would that suicide note aid in bringing a medical malpractice or wrongful death suit against the practice?

I was on a trip that would take me From East to far out West believe it was California. During my trip where I had gotten loaded I was in the process of strapping down my load I felt a pop in my shoulder. I stopped momentarily to see if I still could move it and could so I continued due to the fact I was loaded and on a schedule. No real problems with the arm/shoulder going West. On my return i picked up another load to head back SE about in the Mid- West I started developing some slight discomfort and tingling in the elbow/shoulder, I shake my arm shoulder thinking maybe circulation. I make that next drop and pick up another to head back to the yard (home base). They ask me if I wanted to take a load they have sitting ready to go out so I can already be hooked and paperwork in semi.... mind you I'm enroute, it's at this time I say to them, \\\"Hey I'm having some tingling and pain in my shoulder, I need to get it attended to\\\". Dispatcher says okay come in and we'll get you set up to be seen.... [let me add in before that last trip I took I went and renewed my CDL's and Medical card because I had about 3wks left before it was due, did it early and passed by same entity they use for their drug tests, etc]. So I go in to get seen (Oct5th/'23) they do an xray come back clear, no some physical test and see that specific arm has significant weakness decide to send me for an MRI and pt. I beging the pt before the MRI results come back, actually Physical Therapist calls for the results the same day and says hey they say you have a tear in your supraspinatus and inflammation. I oh okay what's the next step? Physical Therapist says \\\" WC wants you to do 2wks of therapy (about 6 sessions)\\\". I do the sessions and get minimal relief, I return to the Dr. for a follow-up (Wed) and he checks me out again and still sees I have weakness in the arm and recommends me seeing a specialist, by Friday of that same week I get a call from WC saying they're denying my claim give no reasoning as to why and that i should go through my INS. for further care. So I go to the job and talk to them I get the spill about that's who they use for WC and pretty much their hands are tied, it's at this point I research for counseling and retain a counsel by the following wk. I eventually went to see a specialist who initially reviewed the MRI and suggested me getting a cortisone shot in the shoulder and that should give me significant relief and probably rid me of the pain.....it did for every bit of 4 days max. I called in and told them what the results were did a follow up and was told i gad two options, LIVE WITH THE PAIN or SURGERY (i just turned 50yo last yr and have two granddaughters 3yo and 6mos) So I just had surgery 3/15/23 and when the went in found out I had a torn bicep.\\n\\nThe question I have is even though it's WC my lawyer is going up against and they already asked if I would like to settle (prior to the surgery) can I request PAIN, Suffering and Mental anguish?

Aviation is hardest to escape--you actually can't because their doesn't exist any true no fly zones where audible noise cannot reach.\\n\\nLow-frequency noise pollution travels far, easily penetrates multiple layers of wall, and is impossible to soundproof--even with very expensive room-within-a-room techniques.  E.g. Aircraft, louder generators, bass, heavy equipment, ATVs/louder vehicles, construction, drilling, etc.\\n\\nI have a rare condition where these vibrational noises affect my vestibular system causing me to feel off-balance, shaky, and spatially disorientated. There are an increasingly number of people affected by this type of noise, yet there is nowhere that fully accommodates them.\\n\\nEverywhere in the country is largely the same-- catering to the middle 95%, and those that fall outside are gaslighted or told they are unreasonable.\\n\\nRural off grid areas, that most would think are quiet,  have less noise ordinances than suburbs, which are already too noisy for me and I'd have no chance there. Rumbling and bass from distant equipment pierces walls and is often ran all night. Military training very often because these places are \\\"non-populated.\\\"  And noise ordinances rarely if ever cover low-frequency noise and vibration since it's not really captured by sound meters (A-scale), and in the rare cases frequency-weighted ordinances exist, they are almost never enforced. OR, there are exemptions for the noise producers such as agriculture and military.\\n\\nI've moved strategically many many times, and found this type of noise impossible to escape. Aircraft activity seems to be increasing all over. New equipment suddenly pops up in remote rural areas--such as generators or industrial grade pumps running all night.\\n\\nI've spent a lot of money on triple paned windows, with a thicker pane, but does just a little against this type of noise. Thrown away lots of money on airbnbs and one 6-month lease out the door, all of which I never even stayed in. In total, tens of thousands of dollars has mostly went to waste. I thought I found a suitable place which was good for a year, before military noise increased substantially the next, year, and exponentially recently. Additionally a new piece of equipment seems to be running at night. I bought property and built a small home only to run into this.  So that place is done, and I'm out all the permit fees, and stuff like that. But I could hopefully come close to break even at selling.  Recently, I've even assessed medium-tier recording studios (double wall soundproof), where the aircraft noise/vibration still penetrated through.\\n\\nThe point is that anywhere left in the US that might be hanging by a thread as a somewhat suitable place, will likely not be within 1-3 years due to the rate of increase of all these noises.\\n\\nIn order to remain symptom free, I have to spend much of my day idling in my car to mask the noise.  I carry my earmuffs everywhere (even inside), and need to immediately put them on while inside the house when there is an non-jet civilian aircraft, heavy vehicles/ATV, construction or equipment turned on.\\n\\nI can only go outside with earmuffs on because 23.5 hrs of the day there is some kind of distant heavy equipment, distant heavy vehicle, aircraft, etc. creating this type of vibrational noise.  I need to walk within 300 ft. of my truck or my house, so I can run for cover in time when a louder vehicle or aircraft (prop. plane or helicopter) comes closer-- as being outside with earmuffs on alone is not sufficient in these situations., as again this type of noise is poorly attenuated.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\"", "title": "How can noise sensitive people get a designated quiet place?

Someone saying they don't want the tumblr photos they posted a few years ago shared anymore... would sending a couple of them to your buddy Billy Bob end up with a day in court ? \\n\\nIt isn't part of the law. But the fact lawyers recommended it to a government with barely a page of consideration seems incredibly strange to me. It would back door the entire law. People could decide tomorrow that sharing their public nudes was non consensual then next year decide they want to post nudes on reddit again. \\n\\nIs there any other way to interpret it than just an utterly legally incompatible recommendation from people that are supposed to be legal experts ? \"", "title": "Hypothetical intimate image abuse law amendment.

At first I lied about my age and said I was 16 but at the time I was 15. we played Royale high a lot together and we did a lot of sexual things together during the mean time. We then started to talk on discord. About a month into our relationship I started to feel guilty about me lying about my age so I told him the truth about me age and that in reality I\\u2019m 15. he did get upset about he lying but still stayed. \\n\\nwe would talk sexually with each other and he talked to me about masterbating with him when he would and I was nervous at first so I just lied and told him I would do it with him or for him. \\n\\nI\\u2019m a really hyper sexual person because when I was a kid I was exposed to sexual content like porn or sexual mlp stuff on YouTube. I\\u2019ve always been one since then I would watch porn a lot and I used to read a lot of smut fanfics on tumblr and Wattpad I still do sometimes. \\n\\nMy 2 cousins know about us but only one of them know about our age difference. me and her are really close I tell her most of the things that happened between us except for the sexual things. when I told her about it first she was like \\u201cgirlie ur a victim but it\\u2019s not my business\\u201d \\n\\nover the course of our relationship I came to figure out that he has anger issues and trust issues from his past. he would take his anger out on me sometimes and I\\u2019m a very sensitive person so obviously I would cry. \\n\\nThis is my first actual relationship so everything was new to me I\\u2019m not used to affection and he knew that.\\n\\non our month anniversary I would make him gifts like a love letter or reason on why I loved him on google docs. He would give me diamonds and items on royale high and sometimes robux. He would give me real money like 100$ sometimes but he would send it to my PayPal so my mom wouldn\\u2019t know\\n\\nhe cheated on me more then once during our relationship one time in September on a cruise trip while he was in NY and another time from November to December with an old fling. I forgave him for all of it but it just makes me even more insecure \\n\\nI feel like I forgave him a lot because I was scared that if he left then no one would ever love me again. he would try to leave me a lot after things would happen or I make a mistake and I would be crying pleading for him to stay because I loved him a lot he would end up coming back. \\n\\nwe would keep my age a secret from all his friends by lying like him saying he doesn\\u2019t know my age. \\n\\neverything went bad in November when one night he was trying to leave me and we were arguing and he ended up attempting to commit suicide that night. he wasn\\u2019t responding and I was spam texting him and trying to call him. I was having a breakdown a bad one and my mom came downstairs asking me what\\u2019s wrong and I ended up telling her everything because I was scared. she tried to comfort me and told me to stop talking to him because of our age. I was scared and lied to her a couple days later saying I deleted him and the app but in reality I didn\\u2019t.I also told my closest friend and she told me that I was a victim but I didn\\u2019t listen to her and just lied saying I left him for good. I didn\\u2019t end up telling him that my mom knew because I was scared that he would leave me forever.  \\n\\nabout a week later I was just feeling down from everything that happened recently and I woke up that morning feeling like I wanted to kill myself and broke down to my mom how I felt like everyone would be better without me. \\n\\nI just feel like the biggest problem was that people would listen to me but not hear me. which is a main reason why I never opened up to my family and friends on what I was truly thinking.\\n\\nI feel like it would make sense if I atleast have a backstory onto why I act like this. when I was a kid my mom and dad weren\\u2019t together and my dad left us. he was still in my life but never lived with us and the only time I really saw him was on holidays. both of them would yell and scream at me when I would cry. that\\u2019s part of why I\\u2019m so sensitive now that I\\u2019m older I have trouble opening up to people because I\\u2019m scared they\\u2019ll get upset when I tell them my feelings so I\\u2019m just used to solving my problems by myself.

Just a bizarre thing to admit that you smoked weed, pull up your broke-ass wallet, and having somebody rummage through your poorly packed dirty underwear in front of your colleagues and a plane full of onlookers. So I ended up looking into this later and now I'm even more confused. The DEA apparently says you can refuse the search and walk away? The thread I read seems to imply that you can't really refuse the search if you want to board the plane...?\\n\\nSo a few questions for y'all:\\n\\n1. Should you consent to the search?\\n2. What can they do if you refuse? e.g., arrest you, seize your items, stop you from boarding?\\n3. Related to that, why are they even asking and why don't they just do it at the TSA area with their high tech machines?\\n\\nOther thread for reference: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1b2f4d8/refused\\\\_dea\\\\_cold\\\\_consent\\\\_search\\\\_at\\\\_airport\\\\_seized/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1b2f4d8/refused_dea_cold_consent_search_at_airport_seized/)\"", "title": "Does the DEA have the the legal right to seize and/or search your property at airports?", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/1b2r89g/does_the_dea_have_the_the_legal_right_to_seize/"}, {"author": "AnyAbbreviations6571", "created_utc": 1709169901.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 3, "post_id": "1b2nq18", "score": 0, "subreddit": "LegalAdviceOffTopic", "text": "\"How is a jury selected?

Everything is in korean and I'm not a lawyer so I'll try my best to translate\\n\\n1. Says 'labor costs' (\\uc778\\uac74\\ube44) is $400 per month.\\n\\n2. States this is only for work directly related to research. (I'm assuming this is to prevent payroll conflicts with teaching roles, assistants, etc)\\n\\n3. The professor reserves the right to fire me\\n\\n4. 6 or 12 month contracts are 'preferred', but mine is 4 months\\n\\n5. The university reserves the right to change the 'document' if required. (I'm assuming this is for changing terms in the future and not applicable retroactively).\\n\\n6. Some personal information and my agreement to the collection of that personal information\\n\\nFor stuff outside of the contract;\\n\\n1. I'm not hired as a contractor (ie. Finish research on X and get paid Y), I get money even if I make no headway whatsoever.\\n\\n2. I have made no spoken agreements with any relevant party.\\n\\n~~3. New : In a post on the university forum for the same job at a different department specifically states an hourly rate of $10 for 40 hours. I went through a different signing process and never saw this. Can I legally agree to something I was never shown or know I was agreeing to?~~ - isn't applicable, at least in the US.\\n\\n~~4. New : The scholarship section for the university has an entry for the same position at the same $400/m. However hourly rates aren't stated, and it says '40 hours or less per month'. I didn't see this either.~~ - isn't applicable, at least in the US.\\n\\nSo now that's out of the way;\\n\\nI've been working for a couple months but the professor said a week ago we're supposed to work 9 to 6 unless individual agreements have been made.\\n\\n1. No one (including the professor) actually enforces the hours as far as I can tell. I've been working here for a few months and this is the first time I've heard of working hours.\\n\\n2. I never agreed to those hours. It's not in the contract and there is no spoken agreement before or since.\\n\\n3. I don't have a separate agreement with the professor for remote work, but that's how I've been doing things since the beginning. Again, no agreement before or since. I've been working however I want to.\\n\\nBut if someone does try to enforce it, what am I allowed to do?\\n\\n~~1. Report it. Minimum wage is about $10 here which works out to about $2k/m for those hours (vs the 400 I actually get), with a bit of variance depending on how lunch hours, legally mandated break times and whatnot work out to.~~\\n\\nIt seems like certain education related staff are exempt from regular labor laws, both in the US and Korea. I didn't know that! So they wouldn't have to abide by minimum wage, ~~EXCEPT if the part where they specified an hourly rate is applicable to me.~~ Seems like the only thing stopping me from setting my own rate is not wanting to get fired lol.\\n\\n2. Work 9-6 for a few days out of the month. There aren't any clauses saying I have to work consecutive days, or what days I have to work.\\n\\n3. I'm not paid to be on call nor are there any stated overtime rates (maybe there's a national minimum, I haven't checked). So would I be within my rights to be completely inaccessible when I'm not working?\\n\\n4. The aforementioned rates are based on minimum wage.

I had a (somewhat dumb) question on high school attendance, and whether my school district has standing to apply attendance restrictions on certain people. I know that people over the age of 18 are legally allowed to drop out of school, which got me thinking on whether people over the age of 18 are allowed to not attend school in general. So, I went down a rabbit hole of legal information (as one does). Through some thinking, I thought it would apply, but I wanted to know what other people (who have less of a bias) may think.\\n\\nI was looking at my school's attendance policy, which states:\\n\\n\\\"Once students arrive on school property, they may not leave school property without a proper dismissal from a parent or guardian as processed through the main office. Specifically, students arriving to school before the beginning of school hours, by automobile, bus, or any other method may not leave school property. Once a student has arrived on campus, they are to remain on campus. Likewise, once a student is dismissed from campus, they are not to return to campus unless previously determined as part of the dismissal process; this would cause the student to sign-in with the Main Office. All wooded areas surrounding the high school are strictly off limits at all times, including during dances and all co-curricular events. A student who leaves the school building or campus without permission of the administration is subject to search of their person, belongings, and/or vehicle. This serves the purpose of providing a safe learning environment. Students who are not able to comply with this issue of safety and liability may yield an administrative response of varying degrees as such scenarios may be both a non-compliance and a matter of unauthorized absence(s) from class.\\\"\\n\\nSubsequently, the punishment for skipping includes a suspension/detention (including the aforementioned searching of your person).\\n\\nHowever, stumbling on NH State law (SB 18, 2007) that touches on the requirements for attendance states:\\n\\n193:16 \\\"Bylaws as to Nonattendance. Districts may make bylaws, not repugnant to law, concerning habitual truants and children between the ages of 6 and 18 years not attending school, or who are not participating in an alternative learning plan under RSA 193:1, I(h), and to compel the attendance of such children at school; failure to comply with such bylaws shall constitute a violation for each offense.\\\"\\n\\nWherein RSA 193:1 I(h) states:  The pupil obtains a waiver from the superintendent, which shall only be granted upon proof that the pupil is 16 years of age or older and has an alternative learning plan for obtaining either a high school diploma or its equivalent.\\\"\\n\\nWherein the definition for \\\"habitual truant\\\" (per RSA 189:34 Sec. II) is: II. \\\"Ten half days of unexcused absence during a school year shall constitute habitual truancy.\\\"\\n\\nMy question: Does this mean that students above the age of 18, who are not considered \\\"habitually truant\\\", who have been given a waiver from the superintendent, are not to be given a violation under RSA193:16, thus, my school isn't able to punish students (with such criteria)? Further, does the school district even have standing when it comes to addressing attendance policy for students who meet these aforementioned criteria?\\n\\nI further got hung up on the wording of the \\\"or\\\" in 193:16. Is having that superintendent waiver a qualifier? (So, if you weren't accepted into an accredited program, would the district be able to \\\"compel the attendance of such children?\\\" Also, aren't people over the age of 18 not considered *children*? So would this entire law just not apply if you're not considered a child?)\\n\\nI know this is a very goofy question, and I was more curious than anything. I am by far not a legal expert in any means, so I might throw around terminology that doesn't make sense to those who are more refined in the field, so please let me know if you need me to clarify some things.\\n\\nThank you!\"", "title": "Legality on School Attendance (NH)", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/1aqb9va/legality_on_school_attendance_nh/"}, {"author": "sugakkyu", "created_utc": 1707888630.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 1, "post_id": "1aqfdmy", "score": 1, "subreddit": "LegalAdviceOffTopic", "text": "\"Hi everyone, I am currently wondering if there\\u2019s any way I as a civilian, can obtain body cam footage in the state of New Mexico even if I am not currently residing there or related to that person ?

My wife is a teacher and all her coworkers rave about how awesome MEEMIC is, so we took the bait.\\n\\nInitially, MEEMIC was an absolute nightmare to deal with, threatening to cancel the policy 3 separate times due to one of their \\u201cinspectors\\u201d randomly dropping by when we weren\\u2019t home and finding some minuscule thing they didn\\u2019t like. \\n\\nFor example, there\\u2019s a service door on an outbuilding that has some paint chipping off.

She claimed that they had sent several notices and invoices to the bank that holds the escrow account and got no response, so instead of contacting a rep from the bank or me, they just decided to cancel the policy. Jerks. \\n\\nAfter a series of angry phone calls between my lender, the bank, and MEEMIC I finally got some answers. Turns out MEEMIC was sending invoices to a local branch of the bank rather than the banks corporate headquarters. \\n\\nMy question is, had something happened to the house while it was uninsured, would I be SOL even though it was clearly incompetence on MEEMICs part?

For those unfamiliar, the premise of the show is that Gordon Ramsay arrives in disguise as a restaurant patron in order to experience a restaurant without special treatment, and then reveals himself, shows the restaurant owners and staff the error of their ways, rebuilds the menu, renovates the restaurant, and leaves it more successful than when he arrived.\\n\\nWhile cringing my way through some of the episodes, I came up with a lot of questions around the legal aspects of the show. Yes, it\\u2019s reality TV, and it would be na\\u00efve to take what is shown at face-value, but for the purposes of this thought exercise, let\\u2019s do exactly that\\u2026\\n\\nTo start, Gordon Ramsay\\u2019s initial menu sampling (while in disguise) usually involves him spitting out whatever he tastes  into his hand, which he then throws onto the floor or table. If a manager or waitress was to see this behavior and ask him to leave the premises (as they would with any guest), would they be free to continue to deny him access to the premises for the duration of the show?\\n\\nLet\\u2019s take the show\\u2019s premise at its word, that the restaurant owners signed up for a restaurant renovation show without knowing which it is and who the host would be. When Gordon reveals himself and the owners realize that they\\u2019re in for an (un)healthy dose of public humiliation, is there really no way for them to break the contract? Or put another way, could they break the contract and win in court if they were sued? Or, another idea, assuming the restaurant\\u2019s legal entity agreed to the contract and they are already flirting with bankruptcy, would the show be unable to recoup losses from the owners after bankruptcy has been declared?\\n\\nAssuming the owners want to proceed with the show or are fearful or at least have been intimidated into continuing, the staff, who supposedly haven\\u2019t signed any agreement to appear on the show, could theoretically just make a run for it\\u2026 Would it be lawful to terminate an employee who did this?\\n\\nA pivotal scene in the show\\u2019s standard script involves the staff calling their loved ones to tell them that they can\\u2019t come home for the next 24 hours because they need to help renovate the restaurant. Let\\u2019s assume they really don\\u2019t return home for 24 hours-- wouldn\\u2019t this violate some kind of labor law? Note that, per the show\\u2019s premise, they\\u2019re in the middle of a lunch or dinner service, so staff have presumably already been working for several hours leading up to Gordon\\u2019s appearance. \\n\\nDuring a Big Reveal scene in front of a giant television, supposed customers are shown that they\\u2019ve been fed rotten food cooked in unsanitary conditions. What\\u2019s to stop one of them from calling the health inspector and having the show shut down before renovations even start? Given that enough customers present, wouldn't this open the restaurant up for a class action lawsuit?\\n\\nThen there\\u2019s the issue of the \\u201chidden cameras\\u201d set up to monitor restaurant staff.

I am really dreading this. Can anyone tell me what to expect if I end up having to do this? Tips on coping with it?

This ruling is understood to be a principle that can be used against the states, as indicated by the subsequent Supreme Court cases *McDonald v Chicago* and *NYSRPA v Bruen*.  So what we have here is a federal principle which has the power to coerce the actions of state laws concerning access to guns.\\n\\nHowever, I am confused as to how these cases do not violate the 10th amendment.  The 10th amendment goes as follows:\\n\\n>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\\n\\nThe essence of this amendment is a principle that was understood by the founding fathers during the framing of the Constitution.  They understood that the US Constitution was to be a product and descendent of the pre-existing governments of the states which ratified it.  And thus the resulting federal government created by the Constitution was to have no more power than was explicitly given to it by the Constitution.  And furthermore, the states which ratified the Constitution were to remain fundamentally unchanged; they were to be unaltered in both their powers and their form of government, unless explicitly stated otherwise by the Constitution.  As the 10th amendment implies, absent any words to the contrary, the states reserve whatever powers that they had always had before the Constitution, and the people possess whatever powers that they always had before the Constitution.\\n\\nNow, it so happens that one of the powers the state governments possessed before the US Constitution was the power to establish the right of the people to keep arms and to bear arms.  This power is made clear in the arms provisions contained within most of the state constitutions, both before and after the ratification of the US Constitution in 1788.  Here is a list of several of them:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Pennsylvania Constitution, 1776: That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state . . . .\\n* North Carolina Declaration of Rights, 1776: That the People have a Right to bear Arms for the Defense of the State . . . .\\n* Vermont Constitution, 1777: That the People have a Right to bear Arms, for the Defence of themselves and the State . . . .\\n* Massachusetts Constitution, 1780: The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence.\\n* Pennsylvania Constitution, 1790: That the right of citizens to bear arms, in defence of themselves and the state, shall not be questioned.\\n* Kentucky Constitution, 1792: The rights of the citizens to bear arms in defence of themselves and the State shall not be questioned.\\n* Tennessee Constitution, 1796: That the freemen of this State have a right to Keep and to bear Arms for their common defense.\\n* Louisiana Constitution, 1812: The free white men of this State, shall be armed and disciplined for its defense . . . .\\n* Indiana Constitution, 1816: That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves, and the state . . . .\\n* Connecticut Constitution, 1818: Every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.\\n* Tennessee Constitution, 1834: That the free white men of this State have a right to Keep and to bear arms for their common defence.\\n* Florida Constitution, 1838: That the free white men of this State shall have the right to keep and to bear arms, for their common defense.\\n* Ohio Constitution, 1851: The people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security . . . .\\n* Arkansas Constitution, 1861: That the free white men and Indians of this State have the right to keep and bear arms for their individual or common defence.\\n* Missouri Constitution, 1875: That the right of no citizen to keep and bear arms in defense of his home, person and property, or in aid of the civil power, when thereto legally summoned, shall be called into question; but nothing herein contained is intended to justify the practice of wearing concealed weapons.\\n* Colorado Constitution, 1876: The right of no person to keep and bear arms in defense of his home, person and property, or in aid of the civil power when thereto legally summoned, shall be called in question; but nothing herein contained shall be construed to justify the practice of carrying concealed weapons.\\n* Idaho Constitution, 1889: The people have the right to bear arms for their security and defense; but the Legislature shall regulate the exercise of this right by law.\\n* Montana Constitution, 1889: The right of any person to keep or bear arms in defense of his own home, person, and property, or in aid of the civil power when thereto legally summoned, shall not be called in question, but nothing herein contained shall be held to permit the carrying of concealed weapons.\\n* Mississippi Constitution, 1890: The right of every citizen to keep and bear arms in defense of his home, person, or property, or in aid of the civil power when thereto legally summoned, shall not be called in question, but the legislature may regulate or forbid carrying concealed weapons.\\n\\nWhat we can clearly gather from these examples is that the state governments have traditionally possessed the power not only to establish the people\\u2019s right to keep and bear arms, but also to qualify its purpose and function (e.g. the common defense and self defense), to define the scope of the citizenry who possessed the right (e.g. the people, the freemen, the free white men, etc.), and to set certain limitations on the people's right to keep and bear arms (e.g. forbidding the carrying of concealed weapons).\\n\\nFrom the Founding era, although self-defense was a commonly-recurring stipulation, these arms provisions were primarily concerned with the people\\u2019s right to keep and bear arms for the common defense \\u2013 i.e. militia duty.  It so happens that the Constitution in Article 1, Section 8, Clauses 15 and 16 gives Congress the powers to call forth the militia \\u201cto execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions\\u201d, and \\u201cto provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States\\u201d.  Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 gives the President command of the state militias \\u201cwhen called into the actual Service of the United States\\u201d.  But these are the extent of the federal government\\u2019s power over the state militia.  As James Madison states in a Virginia ratifying debate on June 14, 1788:\\n\\n>I cannot conceive that this Constitution, by giving the general government the power of arming the militia, takes it away from the state governments. The power is concurrent, and not exclusive.\\n\\nIn another debate on the same day, John Marshall said this:\\n\\n>The state governments did not derive their powers from the general government; but each government derived its powers from the people, and each was to act according to the powers given it. Would any gentleman deny this? He demanded if powers not given were retained by implication. Could any man say so? Could any man say that this power was not retained by the states, as they had not given it away? For, says he, does not a power remain till it is given away? The state legislatures had power to command and govern their militia before, and have it still, undeniably, unless there be something in this Constitution that takes it away.\\n\\nAnd further, Marshall was recorded to have said this:\\n\\n>He then concluded by observing, that the power of governing the militia was not vested in the states by implication, because, being possessed of it antecedent to the adoption of the government, and not being divested of it by any grant or restriction in the Constitution, they must necessarily be as fully possessed of it as ever they had been. And it could not be said that the states derived any powers from that system, but retained them, though not acknowledged in any part of it.\\n\\nHence, it was always the intention of the Founders that, notwithstanding the power over the militia being bestowed upon the federal government in the Constitution, these declarations of power were not intended to be construed as an exclusive transference of power, nor any prohibition of the states power.  The states were to possess the same power over their militias as they had always had.  And likewise with the state arms provisions, as being the declarations of the people\\u2019s right to keep and bear arms for militia duty or for self-defense.  Nowhere does the Constitution or the Bill of Rights transfer away nor prohibit to the states their power to establish and define the people\\u2019s right to keep and bear arms.  They possessed that power before the Constitution, and they presumably possess it today.\\n\\nWhich is why I am so confused as to the current interpretation of the second amendment, as expressed in *DC v Heller*.  How can the second amendment be understood as a federal principle which can be used against all of the states in the country?  The second amendment was never intended to somehow preside over the arms provisions of the respective states.  As the amendment\\u2019s language suggests, it was written in such a way as to mimic the terminology commonly employed in the arms provisions (e.g. \\u201cThe people have a right to keep and bear arms . . .\\u201d), but rather than to establish the right on behalf of the people, the second amendment instead explicitly states that the right \\u201cshall not be infringed\\u201d.  However, as the express language of the first amendment indicates, and as is confirmed by Supreme Court cases such as *Barron v Baltimore* and *US v Cruikshank*, \\u201cshall not be infringed\\u201d merely means that the statute shall not be infringed specifically by Congress.  The federal government does not, either through the second amendment nor through any other legal means, give or even possess the power to give the people the right to keep and bear arms, as the Constitution has never exclusively taken away this prerogative of the states and given it to the federal government.  To interpret the second amendment to somehow give the American people the right to keep and bear arms is, ironically, a reversal of the amendment\\u2019s very purpose, which was always to prohibit the federal government from infringing upon the states\\u2019 power to operate their own militias and provide for the arming of their own citizens, whether for the common or self defense.\\n\\nAs a further observation, as you may notice from the number of arms provisions listed above, there is no such thing as a \\u201cright of the people to keep and bear arms\\u201d.  None of the state arms provisions ever declared anything like, \\u201cThe people of the state have the right to keep and bear arms.\\u201d  There existed only a right of the people to keep and bear arms \\u201cfor the common defense\\u201d or \\u201cfor the common defense and self defense\\u201d.  The right contained within the arms provisions was always qualified with a purpose or function, and is never actually worded the way that the second amendment is worded.  This appears to make the second amendment unique in a certain way, as amendments one through eight in the Bill of Rights typically borrow distinct rights that had already been stipulated in many of the pre-existing state constitutions, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, peaceable assembly, free press, freedom from unlawful search and seizure, right to a fair trial by jury, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, etc.  But the second amendment strangely contains a statement that doesn\\u2019t appear to be something recognized as a distinct right by any of the pre-existing states.  The Bill of Rights was intended only to restrict the federal government from violating the rights which the people were guaranteed by their respective states, and also for the federal government to grant only the rights to the people which it was within the federal government\\u2019s power to grant.\\n\\nThere appears to be a predicament that has arisen concerning judicial and legislative activity surrounding the second amendment.  For those who would interpret the second amendment to be the federal government granting and guaranteeing the individual right to own a gun, what exactly are the constraints of this right?  The statement contained within the second amendment is unqualified and uncontextualized, yet it is obviously untenable to give Americans unlimited access to weaponry.  What kind of guns should Americans be able to access?  When is it unconstitutional to limit certain kinds of guns?  Where do Americans have the right to carry their guns?  In what manner do Americans have the right to carry their guns?  Is it constitutional to create laws determining who can or cannot own guns, or to create licensing or training requirements?  Is it constitutional to bar ex-felons or the mentally ill from owning guns?  A host of questions and problems arise when we hold the belief that the second amendment itself guarantees an individual right to weapons.\\n\\nBut as we have seen, these complications do not exist when we understand the true and original intent of the second amendment.  The states had always originally possessed the power to establish the right to keep and bear arms, and to qualify the purposes for the right, and to determine who among the people could possess the right, and to establish possible restrictions upon the exercising of the right.  This is the American tradition.  There is no need for any confusion or ambiguity: The state governments possess the power to define the people\\u2019s ability to access weapons.  The states possess this power because they possessed it even before the Constitution was established, and the Constitution has never taken that power away.  The founding fathers would all agree that the states still possess that power today; yet how is it that the states today do not behave as if they possess it?  Have they ever given it away?  The state governments may possess certain powers by implication relative to the Constitution, but the federal government does not \\u2013 it has only the powers which the US Constitution has bestowed upon it.\\n\\nSome might interpret that the 14th amendment to the Constitution has transferred the power to define gun rights to the federal government.  However, no such thing is stated explicitly in the 14th amendment itself, and no part of that amendment can be construed to somehow overturn or circumvent the tenth amendment, which prevents the federal government from possessing any more power than what the Constitution has assigned to it.

These banks mostly still allow SMS as a form of authentication into people's bank accounts or as a verification method when resetting the password. Suddenly, the account owner's phone stops having reception because their number has been transferred to another device and maybe even ported out to another phone company. The thief proceeds to use this to reset their banking password because they already know the victim's full name, date of birth, current address, social insurance number and other personal information. They then do the maximum ($5000 or $10000) Interac e-transfer to some other account under their control without the knowledge or consent of the real account owner. The victim finds out what is going on and notifies the police, the phone company and bank within 24 hours of the crime.\\n\\nSo, in this case, this hypothetical victim has money taken from them. But it may be difficult for the bank to know that because it appears to them that the victim allowed the transaction as someone entered the code (and therefore have given permission for the transaction to take place). Meanwhile, porting a phone number is easy if you know enough account information (and in the case of prepaid phones, there may not be much that someone needs apart from the phone number, the PIN on the account and the carrier).\\n\\nSo, let's say the bank refuses to reimburse the customer because they believe the customer authorized the transaction (when in fact, it was not authorized), and the customer decides to launch a small claims lawsuit (anything under $35000 is considered a small claims case in Ontario, where I live) naming both the phone company and the bank as defendants.

A bank should have protected the customer's money by allowing them to disable SMS-based verification and because they fail to do so despite knowing the risks, it is liable due to its negligence. On the other hand, I realize that it is possible for someone to lose their phone or for the phone to not work anymore and have an eSIM that needs to be transferred to another phone.

I have sued someone for fraud.  The lawsuit lasted many years.  My story is simple: we had a contract, he did not honour it, so I sued him for breach and fraud.  However, finding justice seems so complicated that I am loosing faith in the justice system because I have spent most my lawsuit protecting myself from my own lawyers.\\n\\nI may need to clarify my question: how do you find a lawyer that is good for a common citizen who has not studied the law?\\n\\nI use to think that money (how much you pay the lawyer) was the key.  I am not so sure anymore.  I have paid my lawyers what they ask for; yet they still lied to me and manipulated the system to their advantage and at my cost.\\n\\nIs it the complexity of the case, the same way a real estate broker (representing a seller) would rather sell a house fast than for the best price?  Maybe, but once again I thought I had a very simple case where I have done nothing wrong and the other party has many reasons to be blamed.  Nevertheless, my attorneys have turned the case into a riddle where my wrongdoing was, somehow, to sue the defendant.\\n\\nIs it the familiarity between the lawyer and the court?  As we all know, as much as we like to think that the court is not sensitive to profiling or other external influencers... It is!  But how much of the non written stuff matters, such as the advice your lawyers gives you... but never in writing?  Do you need to hire a lawyer to represent you and another one to check if the first lawyer is representing you ethically and for your best interest?\\n\\nShould I avoid finding lawyers online and do it the old fashion way instead; that is by recommendation?  Should I go to a law school, or even to court to find the \\\"good\\\" ones?\\n\\nWell, my last lawyer was only interested in collecting his $10,000 retainer.  He notified me that he was joining another firm a couple weeks after I signed his \\\"non refundable\\\" retainer agreement. He dropped me a few months later in the middle of my case.  As a result,  I have a few weeks to find a new lawyer and I am traumatised by my previous experiences.  Does someone have a good tip for me?
