I had 10 interviews throughout the remainder of 2023 and almost got hired again, but they pulled out last minute when the person reviewing my application saw I was fired, even though we discussed it in the interview (different person doing the review.) \n\nSince March 2023, I have only been employed for a 3 month contract and moved back to my home state. I have been trying since November to find a job closer to my field with no luck. Recently, I started trying to find literally any job. I thought I had a job as an Amazon driver, but I was rejected because I got two tickets in the last year (the only 2 tickets I've ever had.) I had an interview today for a warehouse job, but I thought I was told on the phone they'd offer it to me if the interview went well, and then all they said was \"we'll be in touch, check your email.\" The interviewer's body language also was also seemingly not interested, which gives me a bad outlook. I don't technically know yet, but I don't have any hopes it'll work out. \n\nI have bills to pay, I don't have a place to live, (I live with my cousin and aunt) and nobody around me understands that I literally cannot find a job. (My cousin thinks I must be doing something wrong in interviews or something, but he's a lawyer and hasn't had to find a job since he was in highschool, outside of his current one. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, but things just aren't working no matter what I do.) I don't know what to do. I have $10k in debt just from moving to and from the job I lost, and I have no way to pay it. \n\nI hate my life, I wish I had never moved, I wish I had a different education or just none at all. I ruined my life, I hate my life, and there is literally nothing I can do about it. My life hasn't improved at all over the past year, it's only getting worse and there's no end in sight. Forget getting back to my dream job, I can't even get hired doing nothing.\n\nEdit: Since so many asked, I got fired from a forensic scientist job. It was my fault, but I also feel like my leadership left me out to dry. My chances at getting another one are slim at this point because they don't want me to be a liability to them. I'm still trying, but I am also trying to find something lab based/adjacent, so that maybe I can prove that I can be trusted in a similar field.\n\nEdit 2: I don't bring up that I was fired in regular interviews unless directly asked. I am still applying for the forensic field in addition, in hopes my dreams aren't over, but I cannot lie there. Governments do extensive background checks and the worst thing you can be to them is a liar.\n\nEdit 3: Law enforcement related positions often require a polygraph exam after you provide background information about yourself, often times directly asking if you were ever fired. I know it's dumb, I don't control it. I, personally, am not a good enough liar to beat a polygraph exam. If it gets to that point, I have to disclose it. I am not really concerned with what they find in a database. I know this is Reddit and \"polygraphs bullshit\" and all that. You act like I have any say in the matter. I can refuse, but then I just will simply be dropped from contention.\n\nEdit 4 (Last edit:) For those who don't know or aren't reading, we literally had a routine ethics meeting (prior to me being fired,) where we discussed someone who got fired for lying on her application. She said she had taken a required class when she hadn't. She got an interview, disclosed she hadn't taken the class, but said she would. She was hired, took the class, then someone else found out and fired her because she misrepresented herself on her application. In this field of work, I cannot lie. As stated before, I don't volunteer the information, but I am not going to lie if I am directly asked because it can and very well might come back to bite me. It is worse to lie about it. For non-industry jobs, I haven't mentioned it at all and I will look into a different excuse for those places, if I am asked in the future. \n\nThank you for all your replies, I can't get to everyone, but I have tried to share information where I can. I know I'll be ok in the end, it's just been really hard and I reached a bit of a breaking point yesterday.

It is used in a very regulated and controlled environment. My boss left in November to start his own software company. He told me to cool my jets, you will be joining me at some point. \n\nAnyway I got this new guy (Indian) in November since he left. I have been the in-charge since my boss left. In January this guy sends me an email about outsourcing this system to an Indian company. I told him that it cant be done. We already use them for tier 1 support and they can barely do it. They can barely add users without screwing it up.\n\nThan about 4 weeks ago he schedules a call with me and a bunch of other people to talk about this application and handing it off to this Indian company AGAIN. I put together a deck explaining what it does in simple language and I went to the end users who gave me feedback about handing this off to this Indian company. They were vehemently opposed to doing this - I just put their feedback in the deck. Nothing about my opinion, just their own words. \n\nThe manager was pissed beyond belief. I could see it at the meeting, it was all over his face. I got word a few days later from another guy that this guy was livid that I spoke to the end users without speaking to him first.

Keep in mind that for 3 months this guy has barely spoken to me. \n\nThan about a week ago with no warning they laid me off. I was not the only one - there were about 100 people. They told me at the notification that my job was eliminated. Than I found out they gave my job to this other Indian guy job who has no experience in this. He is also about 15 years younger than me. I spoke with the guy and he played stupid that he had no idea that this was going to happen.  Yeah sure.\n\nPeople that I work with were totally shocked at what happened. Everyone is saying its retaliation and its obviously not job performance. \n\nI see 3 things going on here:\n\n1. Racism - the IT here is about 80% Indian at this point.\n2.

I figured, that with a few months of experience, I'd surely get accepted into an administrative position, and so I did.\n\nThe interview went well, but I left feeling anxious and defeated for some reason. I landed exactly what I needed, a 9-5 administrative position with good benefits, yet the interview felt weird and I still feel unsatisfied.\n\nWith each new job, I start to lose hope, I really do. At my first few jobs I had a super good mindset, basically a \"new job, new opportunities\" kind of thing. Now, I'm feeling cynical. As almost every single job I had, I only expect toxic coworkers to be present, high workloads, and unappreciative bosses, and I'm not a slacker!\n\nThe interview? Guy was unkept (unprofessional attire + long dirty fingernails), kept telling me to \"chill, you don't need to be nervous\" (I wasn't even nervous), kept looking at his phone when I said something, and lied about the fact that it is mandatory to work a night-shift week every six weeks. I got this job through an agency, and they didn't disclose this on their job post. When I called this out, they didn't know about this at all and told me they'll contact the employer (waiting on what they have to say), so it seems like the interviewer straight up lied because they need more people.\n\nMy thoughts: \"Great... I thought I'll be able to get a nice job, but yet again, there's a bunch of clear signs that this won't be that good.\"\n\nI had a job as a delivery driver which I really enjoyed, and they told me that I could come back. I had a disagreement with my supervisor and he even apologized and begged me to stay. Now my ego is holding me back from doing it, as I left because of unlawful behavior on their part (to which they admitted and apologised for it). I left because it simply didn't match my principles. I got treated unlawfully after doing so much for them (overtime, taking difficult routes/tasks without hesitation, traveling to other cities because of lack of manpower in other facilities, almost never taking sick leave and off days).\n\nI also have my own company, which is earning almost nothing. My main goal in life is to grow as a music producer (my business) just to leave this stupid career bullshit behind. But for now, I do need something to make a living. It's just so damn difficult to find something good without a proper degree. It's like all uneducated jobs are full of toxicity.\n\nWhat can I do to feel good at work? I already checked the boxes of being a good employee, taking care of myself and my sleep and eating habits so that I can work optimally, yet still it's not enough to feel satisfied. I'm a totally different person when at work and I hate it. What I do know is that I either love driving, doing administrative tasks like data input (I love monotonous tasks, don't ask). The work itself is usually not the problem, I worked in a deep-cleaning company where we scrubbed toilets in mental facilities. All I thought was \"if that's what I need to do to grow my business, then that's what I'll do.\" Later on I left because I kept getting bullied by some older guy taunting me about how I'm young and that I'll quit in two weeks, so I quit.\n\nIt's not that I let people live rent free in my head, or that I'm being a softy. It's just that I am so disappointed with how the job market operates and how many miserable people actually are present in workplaces, which is actually logical since 99% of people need to work in order to live, so of course you'll come across assholes. Maybe I am actually being a softy and I should man up and not take anything personal, but my emotions have still led me to write this post and plea for help.\n\nIf anybody was in a similar situation or has good tips, I'll be glad to hear it.\n\nTl;dr: Basically i lost hope for any new job opportunity because of past experiences, and I don't know what to do with that.", "title": "I'm no longer positive about any job I get into, I'm so stuck!", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1b8trcj/im_no_longer_positive_about_any_job_i_get_into_im/"}, {"author": "CalmCoins", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1710012237.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "1bapso2", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": false, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1bapso2", "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/1bapso2/so_hows_the_job_search_going/", "saved": false, "score": 17, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "", "title": "\"So how's the job search going?\"", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "url": "https://imgur.com/a/ctoEfaO"}, {"author": "jujux15", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1710000941.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "1balb8w", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": true, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1balb8w", "num_comments": 43, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/1balb8w/at_the_end_of_the_interview_they_said_good_job/", "saved": false, "score": 15, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "I\u2019m an over thinker but I\u2019ve never had an interviewer tell me good job youll hear from us next week.
