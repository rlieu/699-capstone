Unfortunately i screwed up badly. \\n\\nI was basically given a document detailing how to setup my local development environment. Which involves run a small script to create my own personal DB instance from some test data. After running the command i was supposed to copy the database url/password/username outputted by the command and configure my dev environment to point to that database. Unfortunately instead of copying the values outputted by the tool, i instead for whatever reason used the values the document had. \\n\\nUnfortunately apparently those values were actually for the production database (why they are documented in the dev setup guide i have no idea). Then from my understanding that the tests add fake data, and clear existing data between test runs which basically cleared all the data from the production database. Honestly i had no idea what i did and it wasn't about 30 or so minutes after did someone actually figure out/realize what i did.\\n\\nWhile what i had done was sinking in. The CTO told me to leave and never come back. He also informed me that apparently legal would need to get involved due to severity of the data loss. I basically offered and pleaded to let me help in someway to redeem my self and i was told that i \\\"completely fucked everything up\\\". \\n\\nSo i left. I kept an eye on slack, and from what i can tell the backups were not restoring and it seemed like the entire dev team was on full on panic mode. I sent a slack message to our CTO explaining my screw up. Only to have my slack account immediately disabled not long after sending the message. \\n\\nI haven't heard from HR, or anything and i am panicking to high heavens. I just moved across the country for this job, is there anything i can even remotely do to redeem my self in this situation? Can i possibly be sued for this? Should i contact HR directly? I am really confused, and terrified.\\n\\n*EDIT* Just to make it even more embarrassing, i just realized that i took the laptop i was issued home with me (i have no idea why i did this at all). \\n\\n*EDIT 2* I just woke up, after deciding to drown my sorrows and i am shocked by the number of responses, well wishes and other things.

Honestly, if I wasn\\u2019t terrified of getting fired during this market, I\\u2019d would find this situation funny hilarious.\\n\\nDuring stand ups, My senior engineer has a *very* distinct sound in his background. It\\u2019s  like a vacuum, but the pitch of the sound gets really low, then quickly becomes high-pitch. He was always a quiet, but very cheerful person with a thick Spanish accent. He also lives with his brother, who calls him by his nickname.\\n\\nLast Monday, I played COD late at night, and almost immediately, I heard somebody from the other team with that same vacuum pitch. They were winning and we started arguing, and that\\u2019s when he finally started talking. It was exact same accent, and at that point, I was willing to put money that it was my senior.\\n\\nNear the end of the game, both of us were completely trash talking each other (nothing hateful, just small banter, apparently he\\u2019s very competitive). It felt so out of character for him, he was laughing a lot; it was entertaining. As a joke, I called him out by his nickname, and he immediately goes quiet. I reached out to him after the game saying that it\\u2019s me, and he doesn\\u2019t respond at all. \\n\\nThe next day, his attitude is now cold. He\\u2019s very silent during our calls, and isn\\u2019t explaining things the way he used to in the past. I sent him a message during closing saying that I hoped I didn\\u2019t offend him during the game, and I actually really respect them. He claims he has no idea what I\\u2019m talking about, and just brushed me off. He remained dismissive the remainder of the week\\n\\nNow it\\u2019s the weekend and Im trying to catch up on work, but Im lost on how to proceed with him. I feel like he\\u2019s practically cutting me off. Im not sure what to do at this point. I even recorded the footage from the game, I heard it over again, and there was nothing offensive. He even started the trash talking. This feels so unreal, and I never thought something like this could happen.\\n\\nEdit: For reference, I have 4.5 years of experience. I carry my weight really well in the team and serve as a mentor for junior developers. I\\u2019d  find it hilarious if one of the juniors came up to me and mentioned we met online\\n\\nEdit: I\\u2019m going to clarify a couple of things, since there are a couple of misconceptions that are spreading\\n\\n1) My senior and I have been the only devs for nearly 2 years until 2020. We managed to hire a ton of new graduates ever since the Covid outbreak, and now we have a fully fledged team. There\\u2019s a lot of work, but we have meetings to discuss how to properly mentor juniors and planning for tasks.\\n\\n2) We were on really close terms. I knew a lot about his personal life and vice versa. we were friendly. We\\u2019ve had plenty of banter during our work meetings when we worked alone. This isn\\u2019t some dude I just decided to friendly to. This was a friend that I knew for nearly half a decade. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m shocked at his response\\n\\n3) I did not bother him repeatedly about this situation. The moment he went silent after I introduced myself during the game, i got the hint dropped it. It wasn\\u2019t until I realized that work is currently being affected since our encounter that I sent an apology, hoping to mediate things and continue things as they were before.\\n\\n4) his nickname was something his brother called since they were kids. He personally enjoys the nickname and even has that set as his name in meetings. Everybody at work and his friends call him by it. Some juniors don\\u2019t even know his full first name.\\n\\n5) I record a lot of gameplay, it\\u2019s not something that I did out of context. I went to check on the recording because I wanted to verify if there was anything I said that was vulgar/offensive that might have led to this. He DOESNT know I have gameplay saved. There was NOTHING malicious, from both of us. if he\\u2019s uncomfortable with the gameplay, i\\u2019d delete it in an instant.\\n\\n6) my main issue is that his self-destructive attitude is blocking our development process. I\\u2019m perfectly okay with pretending this never happened. But he\\u2019s not addressing tasks / helping juniors nor is he acknowledging the issue. A lot of work is getting funneled towards me. I DONT mind working a 9-5, 40 hr week, but there are juniors who are need guidance, and if I abandon them, they are more likely going to fired, especially during this market.\\n\\nI thought this was a harmless scenario, and I hoped for advice to address how we can make things better. Instead, I\\u2019m met with pitchforks about I fucked his life over, deserving to get fired along with the rest of the team. Seriously, hop off the echo chamber hive mind and quit exacerbating a situation far beyond then it really is. He needs to grow up and acknowledge that there\\u2019s an issue instead of letting us burn in quiet. \\n\\nEverybody on this thread is trying to explain why he acted this way, but it definitely doesn\\u2019t justify his actions. Nobody deserves to lose their way to pay bills or provide food on the table over something as ridiculous as this.

But solving ANYTHING on your own is a complete and utter waste of time. Don't even spend 5 minutes on a problem. You do not have the base knowledge yet. You will simply be getting frustrated, and spinning your wheels.\\n\\nSo, what do you do? simple.\\n\\n1. Go to grokking the coding interview (no DONT buy it. Waste of money) and look at their list of patterns.\\n2. Pick one pattern, and go to leetcode. Search for problems with that pattern.\\n3. Go through each problem for the pattern, and go STRAIGHT to the solution. Do not even spend 1 second trying to solve the problem. WASTE OF TIME.\\n4. Understand the solution DEEPLY. Make notes. Google things you don't understand. Watch videos on youtube about the solution. Go to the discussion section on leetcode and see what others came up with. Play around with the solution, modify variables, etc. Basically... UNDERSTAND THE SOLUTION AS DEEPLY AS YOU CAN\\n5. Move on to the next problem, and repeat.\\n6. After you have done this for enough problems, you will feel a lightbulb going off in your head. Congrats, now you know how to solve this pattern!\\n7. Go back and pick a new pattern, and do the same thing.\\n\\nBecause you aren't wasting time spending hours on a problem, in just 1-3 weeks, you will have a deep understanding of all the major patterns and common solutions to these patterns. You will be able to recognize how to break down a problem into specific patterns, etc.\\n\\nOnce you have done 300-400 problems like this (it sounds like a lot, but remember.. you are NOT wasting hours per problem trying to solve it.. so you will go through A LOT of problems in a short amount of time.. the key is NOT to memorize, but to UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS), you can start going through company specific questions on leetcode by buying premium.

I mean that literally - I believe, and to a larger degree, I hope, that this is all useless information.\\n\\nHowever, I have helped close to three dozen friends go from getting nearly zero interviews or even responses, to getting them all the time, just by... get ready for it... this one simple trick.\\n\\n\\\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf your primary strategy for applying to jobs is by going to [indeed.com](https://indeed.com), [monster.com](https://monster.com), [jobs.linkedin.com](https://jobs.linkedin.com) \\\\- etc, and hitting submit on an application, then I am so happy to inform you that you're just doing this wrong. I have applied to many jobs this way, and I have sparingly seen a response. Why? Because I'm a shithead, and no one wants to hire a shithead.\\n\\nSo, what did I do instead, and what did all my other shithead friends do instead?\\n\\n# What The Hell To Do Instead\\n\\nHAVE A RESUME THAT LOOKS GOOD\\n\\nI have seen so many resumes from newgrads and junior engineers with the most *blegh* looking resumes. I am not talking content here - by now, I hope you know how to make your resume sound, and this is not going to be a guide on how to make your resume *sound* good. But for the love of God, if you're making your resume on microsoft word, do yourself a favor and [make yourself a resume on overleaf.](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv) Or whatever you want. Make it look good. Overleaf makes it hella easy, especially if you're a developer. Don't know LaTeX? Neither do I, and I got by just fine, and, remember, I'm a shithead. You can figure it out, I promise.\\n\\nOkay, have a nice looking resume? Good.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Use LinkedIn to Contact People. Seriously.\\n\\nI have never, ever, *ever*, sent an application randomly through one of those crap-chute websites and expected to ever hear anything back. And guess what? Lo and behold, I nearly never hear back. So, here's what I do.\\n\\nLet's say I want to apply to a Spotify job. I'll go to Spotify's \\\"careers at spotify\\\" page, and look for two, three maximum, roles that sound right for me. Then, I go on [linkedin.com](https://linkedin.com) and search \\\"Spotify\\\" and land on their company page. You should see something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/uoIPIXH).\\n\\nThen, I click on the [People](https://imgur.com/a/ZBT5oOg) tab.\\n\\nThen, I look at the [filters that are immediately available.](https://imgur.com/a/TQRLKxk)\\n\\nAnd I apply some filters!\\n\\nYou want people in Engineering. You want people who went to your college. You want people who studied what you studied. You want people who are first, second, or even third connections. Just add as many filters as *you* can. The more related they are to you, the better!\\n\\nThen, start mass-adding people that clear the filters. If they are already a connection - great, send them a message. If they went to your school (this is very helpful) - great, send them a message. If they have your first name - great, send them a message.\\n\\nIf they share fuck-all with you, great, send them a message!\\n\\nBut they have to accept your connection first, of course, if you don't have Linkedin premium. A lot of them will. Some of them won't. Whatever, doesn't matter. You really just want 1-3 people.\\n\\nOnce you have at least one person accept your connection request, send them a message! You don't want more than a paragraph. 1-2 sentences telling them why you are messaging them, 1-2 sentences introducing yourself, and 1-2 sentences to just shoot the shit. Something like:\\n\\n\\\"Hey, my name is Texzone, and I am messaging you because I am interested in a job at Spotify. These roles I have sent below seem like a great fit for me (send roles after sending the intro message), and, I would love if you could refer me. I am a newgrad interested in backend development with a focus in data engineering, and I have some experience under my belt that I think would be beneficial to Spotify. \\\\[insert line about your qualifications; seriously, Keep It Simple, Stupid\\\\]. Thank you so much for everything, and have a great day!\\\"\\n\\nThat's it.\\n\\n\\\"*But* u/texzone\\\\*, that's so annoying! I'm surely harassing them by doing this!\\\"\\\\*\\n\\nYou idiot. You know, if they refer you and you get accepted, most companies have a bonus that they offer the employee! It ranges anywhere from 2k-10k. And all they have to do is drag-and-drop your resume on some shitty internal portal, then continue picking their nose while watching whatever tiktok nonsense they were watching when you messaged them.\\n\\nEven if they don't get any money out of it, people like helping other people. Really, it's true. They do.\\n\\nAnd, with a referral, you are almost *guaranteed* an interview if you:\\n\\n1.\\tHave a clean looking resume and it sounds good.\\n2.\\tYou are applying to a role that matches your background/experience, at least loosely.\\n3.\\tThat's it.\\n4.\\tYeah that's really it.\\n5.\\tI swear.\\n\\nEasy. I have applied to dozens upon dozens of jobs this way, and I have gotten interviews at nearly every single damn one. My resume isnt amazing. My experience isn't way out there. My friends? A lot of them had a clean looking resume, but had shit-all for experience. But they all got interviews as well.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am sharing this because I am forced to believe people aren't doing this, and are instead hitting submit on some portal. This is by far the worst god damn way to ever apply *anywhere* nowadays. Unless your resume is filled with jargon, years of experience, and a sprinkle of FAANG, forget this ever being a smart way to apply to jobs.\\n\\nSo, that's how I, a shithead, have gotten over a hundred (I'm seriously not kidding) interviews over three cycles of job hunts that lasted about 3-5 months each. I applied once when I graduated, once during COVID, and just finished a job hunt right now.\\n\\nI *now* have some impressive stuff on my resume, thankfully. I look less and less like a shithead, and more like a professional - much to the dismay of the world - and I *still* don't ever hear back (rarely) from applying to jobs \\\"normally.\\\" I still do apply normally - I'll send out applications every month or so, even when I'm working, so I can keep interviewing and stay ontop of my interviewing game. But from, say, 50 applications I send out, I'll maybe hear one  response.\\n\\nBut when I apply the way I described above? If the person delivered, and referred me, I never *don't* hear back. Neither do my friends. And I will almost always find someone to refer me. So... yeah, I hope this helps.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNote: I guess this may not work for super small startups. Whatever.\\n\\n# FAQs\\n\\n1.\\tIs this method something you would recommend for internships?\\n   1. No, not really - this method is something that I strongly encourage for full time jobs. Internships, co-ops, etc - those are a different beast and I know nothing about that. A college internship? ...Maybe. A High school one? ...Unlikely.\\n2.\\t***AM I SUPPOSED TO SUBMIT MY APPLICATION BEFORE OR AFTER THEY REFER ME***\\n   1. ***VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY MUCH AFTER! DONT APPLY, LET THEM APPLY FOR YOU!*** If you apply before they refer you, well, then, you applied, and they can no longer refer you. So don't apply unless they explicitly tell you to do so.\\n3.\\tAm I supposed to contact recruiters?\\n   1. Yes. They are excellent. Yes, do contact them. But honestly I've just never really had much luck with them.\\n4.\\tDo I attach my resume unprompted?\\n   1. Up to you really. I usually don't. But you can. Especially if u like it\\n\\n## Edit\\n\\nThis strategy may not be so effective anymore.

That said, **I wouldn't be risking millions of dollars in penalties for lying if I didn't know that I haven't.**\\n* Last summer, LoanStreet threatened to sue me unless I took down all of my posts and paid for the \\\"reputation management\\\" costs it had incurred as a result of my posts.^(2) So while I respect the right of real Redditors to be skeptical of and to disagree with me, I encourage everyone to keep in mind that **LoanStreet has admitted to paying professional stooges to counteract my story** (and the stories of other former employees it has baselessly accused me of authoring). While LoanStreet has not revealed the specifics of these manipulations, be on the lookout for odd clusters of comments, upvotes, and downvotes on posts about LoanStreet. Where there is sensuous bootlicking, there could well be money changing hands.\\n* **Do not threaten violence or joke about committing violence against anyone from LoanStreet**. The right way to fight for justice is by sharing accurate information about LoanStreet's labor practices and protecting access to that information.\\n* **Just because a non-disparagement clause is in a signed contract** [**does not mean it's legal**](https://www.reuters.com/article/labor-nondisparagement/law-firms-broad-non-disparagement-pact-violated-labor-law-nlrb-general-counsel-idUSL2N27V1RN)**.**\\n* **None of the factual or legal claims in LoanStreet's legal complaint have been vetted by a judge or jury yet.** Take them with a grain of salt. Many will not age well.\\n* **Most workers who are exploited cannot afford to fight back. Those of us who can, must.** LoanStreet would only pay severance to the people it abruptly fired^(3) if they signed permanent non-disparagement agreements. It forced these people - who, for example, had kids, were pregnant, and/or had a spouse already out of work during the pandemic - to choose between protecting their families from financial strain and protecting other workers from LoanStreet's exploitation. I doubt I would have taken on the risks I have if I had had a spouse or child that I was endangering by doing so. I am inspired to continue fighting by the former LoanStreet employees and people around the world who have thanked me for standing up for what's right. Ideally, this episode causes companies in general to think twice before exploiting their employees and empowers workers with knowledge of [their rights](https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/employee-rights).\\n* I am comfortable accepting the risk of some employers passing on me over this in the future. Those aren't companies I would want to work for, anyway. I currently have a good job with a company I trust and I have no doubt I could find another. I think you'll find that most people, including hiring managers, believe that vulnerable, at-will workers should be able to warn each other about egregiously exploitative companies.\\n\\n# Footnotes\\n\\n1.

I also, had almost no idea how to code because the degree plan had just kicked my ass, so I was just barely keeping passing in my classes.  From August to December, I went on Leetcode every day, and submitted applications every day.  It was a fucking nightmare.  I had no idea how to do even the most basic Leetcode questions.  For two months, it was staring at every single Leetcode question and having no idea how to do it, meanwhile just getting job rejection letters in my e-mail.  Over and over and over.

According to my company, we should work from the office because it will increase collaboration and people will perform better.  Bunch of bs, but I had no other choice at the moment.\\n\\nSo first things first, instead of waking up at 8:20 and join a useless meeting at 8:30, be on mute and proceed to go make my breakfast and take my dog for a walk,  I now have to wake up at 7, get properly dressed (no more comfortable clothes), make sure I have lunch and breakfast prepped, get on the highway, drive, get there at 8:15, mindless chit chat till 8:30, join the same useless meeting on zoom (with coworkers from around the globe, what's the f. point? ) and now I HAVE to/MUST pretend to pay attention to something that has no relation to what I work with because well, I got no more flexibility on my surrounding environment.\\n\\nAt home, I invested in a nice work setup. I have a nice chair, a stand-up desk, wireless keyboard/mouse/headphones, 2 monitors that I can adjust, plus a private kitchen to make my snacks, and teas.\\n\\nThe first time I went to the office and I saw the work environment I felt ridiculous. It's a fucking cubicle, with a shitty keyboard, mouse, and headset. The best part is that the cubicle doesn't have tall walls so I can literally see/hear everything, including other people's monitors.  The monitors, of course, are facing the hallway, so you can't see who's walking behind you, but whoever walks past you can freely see what you are doing.  Manager's dream.\\n\\nI also have to wait in line now if I want to make some tea or something, delightful.\\n\\nAt home, I am able to have a quiet environment and be super productive. When I get a card, depending on what it is, I can finish it in 2-4 hours, and then I can focus on doing something else for the rest of the day (learning/training, other meetings, or just not work at all since I was able to be productive).\\n\\nAt the office, because of being constantly watched, I became lazy just to have something to hold on to/last for the rest of the day. I also noticed that my team members do the same.  Also for me, IT IS EXTREMELY HARD to actually focus with a lot of background noise and as I mentioned above, because of the cubicles, every time someone gets up (every 10 mins), or gets a phone call, my attention is drawn to that and I lose what focus I had.\\n\\nThe company kept saying we will be more productive at the office. That's the opposite of what I am seeing. My team is now taking longer for cards, and the amount of time wasted in the office is ridiculous. The number of people, mindless walking around, chit-chatting in cubicles, going out for lunch/ coffee breaks just to fill in the time is a joke(nothing wrong with that IMO, but I'd rather do that at home).\\n\\nI loved having a private bathroom at my house. I can go and do whatever I want to do in peace. At the office, welcome to the shitty stalls and pooping side by side because, yes, I do love the smell of people farting in the morning.\\n\\nThe people that wanted to go back into the office, after a week of going to work and lunches and whatnot, started to mention some stuff during the stand-ups and I quote:\\n\\n\\\"Are you guys feeling more tired than usual?  I forgot I didn't enjoy the commute\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Man I forgot it sucked to have to prep a meal every day and wait in line in the cafeteria to reheat it\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I actually didn't realize I was saving money eating at home, I spent over 100 dollars last week on coffee and lunch\\\".\\n\\nAt home, after work, I could go for a jog right away or just go watch some Netflix and chill out.\\n\\nAt the office after a long, tiring day? Nope, get in the car, you are going to waste 40 minutes in stressful traffic to get home.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am FUCKING glad, I am putting in my 2 weeks this Wednesday and going fully remote.

I am not trying to say we should all be remote. Companies should offer FLEXIBILITY to let employees choose where to work from.\\n\\nWe have different personalities and different preferences. Just because some people enjoy going into the office (or because management needs control) doesn't mean everyone has to.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am gladly never going to or near an office ever again.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR: Went to the office for the first time in my life.

They dragged their feet for months, pretending to work on it. **After 15 months of praising my work, they abruptly fired me just as COVID froze tech hiring, refused to vest any of the promised equity, and the head of HR (who is also the wife of the CEO and who had spoken to me warmly just the night before) refused to answer my phone calls asking for an explanation.** LoanStreet is run by fancy lawyers and they were crafty with the offer letter language so I had no legal case.

The engineer didn't remember why he had made the change and refused to help me investigate why tests were failing. I privately spoke to him to ask him to be careful with the code in that area because it was tricky, to leave comments if he writes something that might be confusing to another reader, and to feel free to ask me for help in that area since it was my niche in the company. I was trying to do him a favor by not making a more public stink about it. He immediately complained to the CTO, who called me 30 min later to sternly tell me that there was no error because we had tests that would have caught it and to scold me for going out of my lane. I wrote a failing test proving that the error existed and that our tests were incomplete. Then I fixed the error. He brusquely told me to fix anything I had broken by making that change. At the next retro \\\"needs improvement\\\" section I said I hoped we could affirm a team norm of being responsible for your code: being able to explain it and to help fix things if it breaks something.

Please follow the link and mark it as helpful so that the message is amplified and as many people are warned as possible. LoanStreet fires people without warning and makes severance dependent on signing a permanent non-disparagement agreement, so we need to elevate the negative reviews they do have.** They have no legal fees because many of the top people are lawyers, and so they intimidate people into keeping their stories to themselves, even with \\\"anonymous\\\" outlets like Glassdoor available.\\n\\n**Pros**\\n\\n*They are willing to give boot camp grads a chance*\\n\\n**Cons**\\n\\n*TLDR: Stay far, far away unless you're truly desperate. LoanStreet is a raging dumpster fire and you will get burned like many before. After 15 months of praising my work - and as COVID froze the hiring markets in 2020 - they abruptly fired me and withheld $100k in options that they promised me before I was hired.*\\n\\n*The annualized turnover rate in the small NYC office during my time there was around 50%. Every two months or so, someone was fired who said they weren\\u2019t given any warning and the company would tell the same story that this person was given many warnings and opportunities to respond to feedback. I saw a lot of good workers blindsided, some leaving in tears. I thought it was fishy and eventually it happened to me, despite always having received glowing praise from leadership.*\\n\\n*Any promises made to you to entice you to sign an offer should be regarded with extreme skepticism. Get everything in writing and reviewed by a good lawyer.*\\n\\n*After hiring employees with a promise of unlimited PTO, management rolled out a PTO tracking tool that explicitly capped PTO at 15 days per year.*\\n\\n*Before I joined, Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu told me that the first quarter of my stock options would vest after a year. My offer letter said details on the equity compensation would be provided in a separate equity agreement. I wasn't provided that agreement for nearly a year after my start date, and you can imagine my surprise when I saw that I wouldn't begin to vest until nearly 16 months of employment. After 15 months of work, I was abruptly fired and didn't receive a single option.*\\n\\n*Because the offer letter omitted the details of the equity compensation, labor lawyers told me I had no case. Keep in mind, LoanStreet is run by lawyers who used to worth at Cravath, a very prestigious and lucrative NYC law firm. I suspect they knew exactly what they were doing when they wrote the offer letter. If it was just a good-faith mistake, they could have done the right thing and granted me the options I earned. They chose not to.*\\n\\n*Placing my trust in LoanStreet was a costly mistake. If you're reading this, please don\\u2019t be fooled by the Series B funding or the impressive pedigrees of the leaders; this place is a fraudulent, exploitative mess and you have a good chance of being fired within a year.*\\n\\n*CEO Ian Lampl is the ringleader of this racket, but Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu, CTO Larry Adams and the rest of leadership are his spineless sycophants. They either agree with Lampl's despicable abuses of his employees or are too cowardly to stand up for what's right.*\\n\\n*This group will twist employees\\u2019 arms to post positive reviews after they see this one, just like they have in the past, but this review is the real story and just the tip of the iceberg, given LoanStreet's practice of paying fired employees to sign permanent non-disparagement agreements.*\\n\\n*You deserve to be treated with dignity. Work elsewhere.*\\n\\n**Advice to Management**\\n\\n*Your exploitation of people is disgusting.

A awesome woman at said space company, recommended me to her friend on another team and I got the interview then the job. So what else did I do in terms of the crazy amount of interviews and applications? I did some Hackerrank, Leetcode, and messaging recruiters on LinkedIn which helped me get interviews. Polishing my LinkedIn helped me get way more traffic and I got a Google interview doing so. I also used organizations like NSBE & ACM to help me get interviews at conferences or find resources. My resume also went through numerous changes over the span of my applying to jobs (August - Now). In terms of job sites, I used everything.

It didn't have the problems that Blizzard has - it was far from \\\"frat boy\\\" - it was more Office Space-esque cynicism.  It affected me far more than I realized, because as a young professional, I sought approval from my older peers and bosses.  I wanted to *fit in*, so I behaved the way they did.

I was completely blind to it at the time, but in hindsight, I was surrounded by bitter, jaded, poisonous people, and I became that way myself.\\n\\nI know it seems slimy to call the perpretrators at Blizzard victims too, but many of them are, because work does that to you.

If you find yourself at a company that tolerates anything even approaching the way Blizzard let its male employees treat its female employees, do something about it, or quit, or both.

I tend to see any variation of \\\"Is this offer good?\\\" or, \\\"Why do I have to grind leetcode?!\\\". Most of the on-the-job posts consist of \\\"I am in a toxic environment\\\" or \\\"Should I change jobs?\\\"\\n\\nI have a piece of career advice for anyone who is fairly new to the field that I think could prove helpful. \\n\\nFirst, a little about me as while I'm not going to hinder my anonymity I do feel I'm in a position where I can rightly prescribe advice to newer SE's / grads / those still school: I'm a Principal Engineer, and have a wide array of experience across operations (including release / implementation) as well as experience developing user-facing code, and internal tooling used organization-wide. I've worked in the DOD, networking space, e-commerce, and fin-tech. \\n\\nJobs I've held include:\\n\\n* Software engineer (senior/staff/principal)\\n* DevOps Engineer\\n* Lead DevOps engineer\\n* Lead Site Reliability Engineer\\n* Tech Lead\\n* Software Development Manager\\n* Director of Operations\\n\\nOne of the greatest skill deficiencies I see in engineers has always been communication. Communication is a very important part of our job. It allows us to promote our ideas, defend our solutions, play the Devil's Advocate, request help, refuse help, patronize others as well as compliment them. We can use communication to self-promote or self-deprecate. Communication literally sets us apart from every other species on this planet; that's not to say other species can't communicate, but that you won't see one chimpanzee explaining to another what the functional use of a blow-hole in Blue Whales is after explaining the nuances in their childrens' respective behavior while foraging for food. \\n\\nHere is a hard reality for many engineers: ***Even if you are the best software developer at your entire company, getting others (employees, external customers, internal customers) to actually use what you wrote is a different beast than writing a tool.***\\n\\nHere is another hard reality: ***Many tasks rely on others to \\\"un-block us\\\". There are of course times when the blocker is stubborn enough that solid communication doesn't help, but solid communication never hurts.*** \\n\\nIt's not uncommon for a developer to feel like a priority queue that relies on other priority queues which are poorly optimized, and plagued with race-conditions. \\n\\nBelow are some points I'd like to make on the subject of communication:\\n\\n**Being direct is not mutually exclusive with being polite**. I often find overtly rude people fall on the \\\"I'm just direct and straightforward!\\\" excuse as though it actually is an excuse for their rudeness. Consider different ways to say the same thing. This SR, and many others, while not inherently controversial (rudeness is often derived from controversial topics), is plagued with what I'd call \\\"direct rudeness\\\". Most of us who have posted here at one point or another have been faced with someone who disagreed but failed to do so in a way that made us feel any productive discussion was possible. \\n\\nConsider the following two versions of the same sentence (email threads I've actually witnessed, redacted of course):\\n\\n>Hello \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_, you are writing a tool that duplicates work done in a tool I've already written. You need to do a better job of communicating what you're working on so we aren't constantly creating duplicate work and wasting time.\\n\\nHowever, consider had it been structured slightly differently:\\n\\n>Hello \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_, I noticed you're contributing to a tool which I found here(assume a link to source). I'd like to learn more about your specific needs and perhaps discuss whether $TOOL\\\\_I\\\\_ALREADY\\\\_WROTE would fit them, and if not perhaps we could discuss continuing your thread of work towards enhancing the existing tool-set by adding any features you find it's lacking, as there is certainly some overlap. It'd be great if we could avoid duplicate efforts and enhance a tool that's already in use by the organization. Let me know your thoughts.\\n\\nBoth sentences communicate the same message, but the former puts the recipient on the defensive and immediately raises a few barriers in their mind. Upon receiving it they will be texting / chatting most of their close-colleagues about what a jerk you were. You turned your potential meeting on the topic into a street brawl instead of a discussion. Sometimes it can work out, but why cause additional stress? \\n\\nI'd argue that the second version of the sentence still gets the point across but puts the recipient and relative ease and opens a dialogue. To expand upon it a bit more in the second version we acknowledge that the recipient is writing a tool, and raise the concern on the overlapping functionality of that tool with an existing one. The purpose of the email is clearly stated as a goal; avoiding overlap. It's not an accusation but a goal and the use of 'we' puts a collective goal in the recipient's mind. Closing with \\\"Let me know your thoughts.\\\" opens a dialogue whereas the over-directness of the first version never actually indicates any interest in a dialogue or common goal.\\n\\n**Everyone is busy, even when they aren't.** We all need things from colleagues, and some colleagues are naturally more busy than others, and some seem like they're never actually working on anything. It's not our job as developers / individual contributors to judge another's workload (and if it is you should evaluate your company's situation). Many things are cyclical and you may be faced with situations where you need a thing done by someone you do not particularly enjoy working with. I have found strategies in communicating with such people that have been effective, for the most part. \\n\\nPeople love when you acknowledge \\\"how busy they are\\\" even when they aren't ever really busy from your perspective. Consider two people asking you for help:\\n\\n>Hey \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_, can you please do \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ for me? This is very urgent and blocking $IMPORTANT\\\\_THING.\\n\\nConsider that your $IMPORTANT\\\\_THING isn't always their $IMPORTANT\\\\_THING. Your emergency isn't always theirs. In a company that is unified it certainly should be, and we should all be empathetic and helpful when we can and have the bandwidth, but it's not always the hand we're dealt. Consider this slight change:\\n\\n>Hey \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_, I know you're really busy and I'm sorry to bother you! We have an urgent ongoing issue and I'd really, really appreciate it if you could take some time to look!\\n\\nKeep in mind these are all suggestions and things that have worked for me, but I've had much better luck with using the second version over the first. To reiterate: People love to appear busy. Especially at work. I don't know what it is about perpetually being busy, but it's a badge of honor in our work culture and to not be busy is to not be relevant. ***Also keep in mind that you yourself are not a metric by which to judge people. If you put in 80 hours a week at your salaried job, that's your prerogative. Do not hold that expectation of others.***\\n\\n**Strong opinions are still opinions.** This one is very relevant in our field as there are many subjects which are inherently based on opinions which draw a lot of controversy. Spaces vs tabs, programming syntax, which language to use, which tools to use, log formatting, etc.. Sometimes we're opinionated about the problems that need to be solved. Do they need to be solved? What's the reason we're solving it?\\n\\nAlways be self-aware of when you're prescribing your opinion vs. when you're prescribing factual-based information. Pick your battles. If you like tabs, and the project uses spaces, that is not the battle to pick. It's not even really worth a mention unless you can do it without being a jerk. If you want to prescribe your strong opinions onto others then be prepared to back up why you wish to do so.\\n\\nI recommend being objective, always. Do not make statements that cannot be backed up with other objective statements and explanations.\\n\\nIdentify why you're so strongly opinionated. Can you present your opinion in a way which shows it derives some mutual benefit?\\n\\nSometimes one opinion can be stronger than another opinion but this is usually rooted in **facts or history.** For example, the spaces vs. tabs talk is inherently based on opinion. If you walk into a project which uses tabs, and you are a spaces person, you ***do not just reformat the whole project to spaces. This will only make you appear to be an asshole.*** This is also a case where your ***opinion is wrong. Not in that one is superior to the other, but the fact that now when I run a diff in SCM across to revisions, you just created a shit-ton of change where there actually was none, making debugging harder and all because you felt your opinion was superior.*** \\n\\n**In closing -** I just wanted to possibly help some others in their communication style by providing some examples where I saw what I'd consider communication miss / failure, and examples that have personally worked wonders for me. I'm open to any additional input / advice / suggestions that could help others, as well, including if you want to indicate anywhere you disagree with the things I've said and make suggestions I might not have considered.\\n\\nJust always be aware that if you aren't communicating at your job, something is wrong. If you aren't communicating ***effectively*** then you are going to hit unnecessary hurdles in your career; a career that is inherently difficult to navigate given the constant churn on technological advancement / changes. I highly recommend any new engineer to host as many lunch and learns, and project demos as they can (code you wrote, tools you wrote, etc..) to improve these skills early in their career, as it will pay massive dividends in the years to come. As for written communication, if you are communicating something that feels edgy / difficult, then sit on it for a bit and proof-read / reread it. Pretend you're the recipient and how you'd respond if you received it from yourself. Consider your relationship with the person you're sending to, and how they respond to and consume various types of communication. Always be learning about your peers and learn how to navigate their personalities in ways that increases your success without inhibiting theirs.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThanks for reading.\"", "title": "Please don't neglect your communication skills in favor of improving your leetcode skills", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qc50hf/please_dont_neglect_your_communication_skills_in/"}, {"author": "yeahdude78", "created_utc": 1663915062.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 592, "post_id": "xlptfl", "score": 2943, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "text": "\"This post is not meant to discourage anyone.

I was just curious and decided to do a fun experiment.\\n\\nI have been hearing recently about how everyone should \\\"learn to code\\\", and how there are mass amounts of people going into computer science in university, or teaching themselves to code.\\n\\nWhat puzzled me is that if there are so many people entering the field, why is it still paying so much? why are companies saying they can't find engineers? Something was not adding up and I decided to investigate.\\n\\nSo I spent a few months asking \\\\~500 people on this sub if they were able to teach themselves enough to become an actual software engineer and get a job. I made sure to find people who had posted at least 1-1.5 years ago, but I went back and dug up to 3 years ago.\\n\\nOut of the 500 people I asked, I had a response rate of 267. Some took several weeks, sometimes months to get back to me. To be quite honest, I'm surprised at how high the response rate was (typically the average for \\\"surveys\\\" like this is around 30%).\\n\\nWhat I asked was quite simple:\\n\\n1. Were you able to get a position as a software engineer?\\n2. If the answer to #1 is no, are you still looking?\\n3. If the answer to #2 is no, why did you stop?\\n\\nThese are the most common answers that I received:\\n\\nQuestion # 1:\\n\\n\\\\- 12 / 267 (roughly 4.5%) of respondents said they were able to become software engineers and find a job.\\n\\nQuestion # 2:\\n\\n\\\\- Of the remaining 255, 29 of them (roughly 11%) were still looking to get a job in the field\\n\\nQuestion # 3:\\n\\nSince this was open ended, there were various reasons but I grouped up the most common answers, with many respondents giving multiple answers:\\n\\n1. \\\"I realized I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would\\\" - 191 out of 226 people (84%)\\n2. \\\"I didn't learn enough to be job ready\\\" - 175 out of 226 people (77%)\\n3. \\\"I got bored with programming\\\" - 143 out of 226 people (63%)\\n4. \\\"It was too difficult / had trouble understanding\\\" - 108 out of 226 people (48%)\\n5. \\\"I did not receive any interviews\\\" - 58 out of 226 people (26%)\\n6. \\\"Decided to pursue other areas in tech\\\" - 45 out of 226 people (20%)\\n7. \\\"Got rejected several times in interviews and gave up\\\" - 27 out of 226 people (12%)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnyways, that was my little experiment. I'm sure I could have asked better questions, or maybe visualized all of this data is a neat way (I might still do that). But the results were a bit surprising. Less than 5% were actually able to find a job, which explains my initial questions at the start of this post. Companies are dying to hire engineers because there still isn't that large of a percentage of people who actually are willing to do the work.\\n\\nBut yeah, this was just a fun little experiment.

Yes, you can self teach yourself everything you need to know over 2-4 years, maybe 1 if you really cram, and you can build up a portfolio. So then what is your plan to get a developer job? You're going to nail the technical assessments? Ok, cool. How are you going to get the interviews? Your resume, assuming you put a lot of effort into making it look good, will always look like shit compared to even people who went to a boot camp let alone got a CS degree and are competing for that entry level job as well.\\n\\nLook, it's no secret that college is overpriced, it's expensive, you won't learn specific job skills like React there, etc. etc. I get that plenty of people get into the industry without a CS degree. I'm one of them. However, I also was able to get dev experience at my old job and get a couple interviews because of having 1.5 YOE of dev experience to get my current job. My old job I only got because I have a bachelor and master's degree in a field that old job was interested in. Oh yeah, I sent out 200 applications and got 2 interviews. 1 offer. The interview that resulted in an offer came from a referral I got by dumb luck.\\n\\nThe thing is that theoretically you could teach yourself everything you need to know in far less than 4 years and for damn near free with all the resources out there. If you have never gone to college yet though, you're about to graduate HS, etc. though it just amazes me at the stupidity of the idea of not wanting to go to college and just take the easy way out. You're not taking the easy way out by eschewing college and a CS degree. You're taking the hard way out because you're going to be one of those baby turtles hatching on the beach and trying to make it to the water. A few will make it...most will get eaten.\\n\\nIf you want to roll the dice with your life and career, sure go for it, I guess you can always go to college after you most likely fail to get an entry level job self teaching yourself. The only cost to you is time which of course you'll never get back. I personally don't understand why you would intentionally try to sabotage your life though. As an aside, if you're older and thinking of breaking into the field at the age of 25, 30, 35, etc. don't worry about this comment. I'm 37 and just broke in a couple years ago myself. I do feel like I need to \\\"catch up\\\" in terms of career but it's fine. Time is indeed a very real cost though and should be considered when making important life decisions.\\n\\nAnd to be clear, this is specifically directed at people who are of traditional college age, or about to be, who have no debt, kids, etc. getting in the way of them going to college. I just wanted to point out, as someone who is self taught themselves, that going the self-taught route is brutal as fuck and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.\\n\\nEdited to add: Some people seem to misunderstand the intent of this post. Not sure if I could have worded it better or their reading comprehension is terrible. At any rate, I'm not saying you're nothing or somehow \\\"less\\\" for not going to college. I'm saying that HR / recruiters will most likely filter out your resume for stronger resumes because the vast majority of your competition will have degrees and you won't. It has nothing to do with how good you are at development. It has everything to do with how qualified HR / recruiters think you are for the job posting they're trying to fill. It's common sense but enough people are questioning it that I guess I'll use a very simplistic example. 1 entry level job posting gets 600 applications. Very common thing to happen. Let's say 300 applications have CS degrees, 200 have boot camp certs, 100 are self taught. They want to pick 20 or 30 to interview. Why even look at the self taught? Hell it may be tough for the boot camp certs to get interviews. From the standpoint of trying to find candidates, most likely they'll pull the best looking 20-30 resumes from the CS degree applicants.

It's the amount of kids who are confidently incorrect and voice their inexperienced opinions as fact. \\n\\nThe problem is the new grads who think their limited experience is representative of the whole industry. The problem is the college kids who think their limited interactions with CS folks makes them an expert. The problem is the high schoolers who see the above commenters and blindly regurgitate that garbage.\\n\\nThe problem is that the above people almost always fail to qualify their statements with what their background actually is. \\n\\n* They fail to say, \\\"I've seen others say....\\\"\\n* They fail to say, \\\"As someone still in college, I think....\\\"\\n* Instead, they say, \\\"This is how things are.\\\"\\n\\nFor a sub about career questions/advice, how are the newly initiated supposed to differentiate the hot garbage from actual, useful advice? (Hint: They don't!

They tried to straw man me by saying I believe all big tech was 60 hour work weeks.\\n* Someone was overinflating Bay Area rent prices. What did they do when I confronted them about it? They proudly claimed that their Canadian ass knew better than my 20+ years of living here because they looked up the price of a specific apartment in SF next to a train station.\\n* Someone claimed something iffy about the hiring process (I forgot what by now). What did they do when I asked them for a source for their statement? They referred to their astounding experience of setting up career fairs...as a student.\\n\\nThere's a reason why more experienced folks think this sub has become trash. It's become flooded with ego-boosted kids who comment as if they've never been wrong a single time in their lives.

Bootcamp graduate. Based in the UK.\\n\\n**How the interview process went:**\\n\\n* CEO: \\\\*is impressed by resume, thinks I'll be a great fit\\n* Lead dev: \\\\*Asks me some React questions - I answer them. Asks me if I know Redux and I said no.\\n* Lead dev: \\\\*Gives me a React challenge which is apparently one of the features of their product. I finish it and add some extra features I think will make the app have a better user experience.\\n* CEO a few days later \\\\*says lead dev was really impressed by my work\\n\\nI get an offer. I am very happy. **The lead dev seems extremely nice and tells me to ask him any question whenever I might need help or get stuck.**\\n\\nDay 1 - Day - 3: I see that the codebase is really messy. Some parts use JavaScript, some use TypeScript. Some use class components, some use functional components. Some files are extremely massive which can be broken down into smaller components/chunks. I was already told that they hired lousy devs in the past and that the codebase is trash now. I am given to implement some design changes for the login, sign up and a forgot password page. It's my first day and I dunno where is what, I make some simple changes on my own branch. Second and third day, I am almost done. Just some design tweaks here and there.\\n\\nThese 3 days I asked the lead dev lots of questions, most were on git as I was struggling to rebase my branch off of development and merging with development instead of master. He happily helped me and in some cases he told me to problem solve it on my own, which I successfully did.\\n\\nDay 4: I have to make two components interact with each other and from the codebase it wasn't obvious to me that they are parent-child. Even though I dunno Redux, I thought that is possibly the only way to implement the interaction. I ask the lead dev about it (previously he told me before my first day that he will give me a crash course on it) and he said **we'll jump on a call soon** (we work remotely) - so ***he*** **offered to help**.\\n\\nHe sees the problem and lets me realize that they are parent child, and so I can just pass props (no prop drilling required). I had to pass the prop from child (written as function) to parent (written in class) and I got a bit confused and asked him what will be the best way to tackle it - he says \\\\`${myName} that's very basic\\\\`. I realize its probably a dumb question and asked him not to worry about it and that I'll figure it out.\\n\\n**NOTE**: I know I'm expected to know React, which I do and would have solved this on my own - just got slightly confused and since we were already on a call and I have been told before that I can ask for help whenever I need, I went ahead and asked it. As you know I was initially expecting some Redux topics to get knowledge on and how it has been used on the codebase.\\n\\nDay 5: Starts with a meeting, where the CEO says that the lead dev said that I ask a lot of questions that I can just \\\"google\\\". The lead dev said I asked a very basic question and that I don't know how to pass props. Funny thing? - the feature I worked, I literally made an extra component myself to keep my files cleaner. The component is of course reusable and can be used throughout the codebase. So I respectfully told him that if I didn't know how to pass props I couldn't have created the component and used it.\\n\\nHe didn't reply to that and just closed of saying I wouldn't be a good fit. He further added something like, \\\"Ik I said, you can ask for help/ask questions. Well that isn't quite true\\\". I was shocked.\\n\\nP.S: Worst thing about this experience?

Sorry for the shitpost/rant, but it\\u2019s caused me a lot of distress and I was stupid enough to turn down some offers/interviews as well because of these guys. I got a job now, but it\\u2019s like come on guys why. I\\u2019m basically done with this subreddit.\\n\\nedit: so I wasn't expecting this much of a response...So I decided to respond myself.\\n\\nTo people saying I was an idiot rejecting offers based on what I read here. You guys are 100% right!!!! I was so fucking stupid, trust me my parents let me know too. Also, I have a job now so I mean luckily it worked out for me in the end. Others might not be so lucky, but that is on them.\\n\\nI thought of a fix from a previous forum I used to use called Arenajunkies(RIP). It was a forum where certain subsections of it only junkies(gladiators in WoW top 1% pvpers of the current season or was it 2400 + current season and rank 1s were allowed to post)! Now you might say meadow that's a game we can't do that here and I say you are right...We can do the next best thing we can have an email confirmation of your workplace and for students their school email(make sure its a work email, not gmail/hotmail/aol...etc) and only those with confirmed work will be allowed to post in certain tags and have flairs (much like team blind/arenajunkies). I.E. Someone puts a flair on a post that says \\\"Senior\\\" only seniors are allowed to respond.\\n\\nTo the people that say new grads have a lot of good advice/sage knowledge about the recruiting process...Well you didn't read my post it was about job advice not the recruiting process although I guess its similar. Either way I looked up half of you and the majority of you were new grads/students go figure.\\n\\nEither way I wish you guys all good luck and happy holidays. I don't expect to posting much here anymore.\"", "title": "As a new grad and students please don\u2019t give job advice it\u2019s so toxic", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a9zsq2/as_a_new_grad_and_students_please_dont_give_job/"}, {"author": "throwaway982908", "created_utc": 1540587696.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 202, "post_id": "9rolfi", "score": 2350, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "text": "\"This is not meant to be a racist post.

I'm happy to answer any questions for anybody who has them.  \\n\\nMy first job out of school was for 77k, my second job was 140k -> 165k after a promotion, and my third job is over 300k now.\\n\\nHere are my interview stats from this interview run.

Don't take things personally, and do as many interviews as you possibly can \\n2. Network, network, network. I kept a list of former teammates and companies they left for, people I've met online through various forums who work at big companies, IRL friends who work at big companies, etc etc. And when I went to interview, I hit all of them up and asked for a referral. It was a crucial part of the process\\n3. Time your process well. I interviewed with a bunch of \\\"sub-tier\\\" companies to get real world practice after I was done with Leetcode/mock interviews/other practice. I had my Capital One and Attentive onsites before any important ones, and they were crucial in my later onsites. Case in point, I failed my first onsite (Attentive) but passed my next 3 \\n4. For practicing Leetcode, quality > quantity. I did about 70 Leetcodes spread across graphs, trees, dynamic programming, string puzzles, array puzzles, linked lists, LRU cache/binary search/hash map from arrays type questions, etc. If you can't pick up on the general patterns by then, you should work on your approach and question quality\\n5. Work on your resume. Go on resume review sites and pay for reviews. Post every week in this subreddit. It's important\\n6. Know your language. Practice/document all syntax things you will need to do all types of questions. Don't let this be the thing that fails you \\n6. Document all of your Leetcode studying/DS Algo studying/behavorial answer prep in Google drive or something.

I passed and was given an offer. \\n\\nA few months later, the company asked me and everyone else in my program to fill out a skills and interests survey so that they can match us up with teams.
