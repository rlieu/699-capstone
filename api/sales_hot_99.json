He was having me deliver a package to a location 15 miles away, picking one up from the drop-off, and bringing it back to him. At the end of the ride he asked if I would be open to doing private airport and delivery rides for him. We exchanged numbers and I didn\\u2019t hear from him for 6 months or so. \\n\\nHe messages me one night asking if I could pick up his brother (business partner) from the airport late the next night. I accepted. He then messaged me the following day asking if I could pick up his mother from airport as well. No problem at all. \\n\\nI had already researched him and found out that he is the founder of a global manufacturing company. I message him that evening asking if he had any openings at his company. I told him I would just love the experience and I would bust my ass.

I listened for things like rapport, types of questions, DM landscape, pricing strategy, closing ability, up front contracts, trial closes, open vs closed ended questions and on and on.\\n\\n**EDIT TO ADD: This is a sales floor of 26 sales people selling B2B SaaS. Average deal size is $32k in first year revenue and requires a contract.  Average contract length 19 months (meaning we sell 1 and 2 year and that is the average).**  \\n\\nBelow are my key findings and boy were they eye opening.\\n\\nThe main point take away would be this - the quality of the lead is way more important than anything else.  The top sales people don't do anything special; it's more what they don't do that is the difference.  They keep it simple and just ask \\\"would you like paper or plastic\\\"\\n\\n* Rapport - The top sales people have almost zero rapport.  Nothing about personal, nothing about business, just nothing.  They jump right into everything without the pleasantries.\\n* Discovery - The top sales people are asking less than 5 questions in discovery and it certainly isn't SPIN or Challenger or Gap.  - No \\\"knock on effect\\\" questions or anything.   It's just a couple of basic \\\"are you qualified\\\" questions.  And I don't even mean around BANT or MEDDIC - literally just \\\"what's your credit score\\\" level qualifying question.\\n* Demonstration - The top sales people are doing, what can only be described as, feature dumping.  It's is just a quick rant on all the top features.  There is no tailored benefit statement, need payoff or anything.  It's literally just \\\"here is feature x and it does this.  Here is feature y and it does this\\\"\\n* Decision makers - Either they are there or they aren't and there is nothing the top sales people are doing to ask for them.  Sometimes they are booked in with the DM from marketing, sometimes the influencer brings them on a later call.  Sometimes they don't show up at all.  The top sales people aren't ever talking about them and just going in a straight line, repeating the same process each time.  There is a small difference in win rates when they are there vs when they aren't but not enough that we need to focus on it.\\n* Closing - The closest I've heard to asking for the business in the 100 calls was \\\"what are your thoughts\\\".  There is no actual request for the business.\\n* Objection handling - the deals that close, just don't seem to have them.  the customer is already basically sold so the questions are more around \\\"how does this work\\\" and not objections.  If there was an objection it would be met with something like \\\"yeah, I hear what you are saying and this may not be the best solution for that\\\".  There is brilliance in this answer to some degree.\\n* Follow up - No evidence of it.  The quote is sent to the customer and sometimes they email back and sometimes they don't.\\n\\nSo?  What did I see that made these sales?\\n\\n* Great leads from the get go.  These customers were perfect fits and were in market.  Either having been past customers, referrals or working with an inferior competitor that we could beat on product and price. Some were from marketing but most were prospected by the sales team.  The people relying on marketing were the bottom performers.\\n* Top sales people just took them through the process and showed them everything.  Bottom sales people RAN a process.  By that, I mean they asked very salesy questions like \\\"why is that important to you\\\" or \\\"what happens if you don't do x\\\" or \\\"is there anyone on your side that would feel left out if they didn't have input on this?\\\".  If a need payoff question was asked that deal was almost always moved to closed lost.  People hate these and it puts them in a defensive position.\\n* Tone.  Everything came down to tone.  It wasn't what people were doing, it was the people doing it.  It wasn't the questions that annoyed people, it was the way the sales person asked it.  Top sales people come off as nice, polite and enthusiastic.  Average or below sales people just didn't. The late night DJ voice may be great for hostages, but will a death sentence in SaaS.\\n* Price - top sales people always opened with a very very low price.  They didn't try to max out each deal, they just gave the best price they could.\\n* Top sales people treated every person like they were the decision maker.  They empowered them during the process and, if that person reached the end of their line, they would offer to care the deal to the next person, they never had to be asked to.\\n\\nSales is a WAY less complicated than we make it.\\n\\n* Get the best leads in your pipeline.  If you aren't given them, go prospect to them.\\n* Don't make it hard for people to buy.  Just show them what you have.\\n* Discovery is wildly overrated.  Not that it isn't important it's just that, unless you've mastered it, you're better off keeping it simple rather than trying to master it on the call with a customer in real time.  Save that shit for off the phones.\\n* How you sound is the biggest differentiator for sales success.  Some people have awesome voices some don't.  If you are outside sales then it's probably how you look more than sound.\\n\\nAnyway, that's my observation and I hope it helps people simplify the process down.\\n\\nTLDR; Gong might be full of shit.\"", "title": "My top level take aways after having listened to 100 sales call", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/13uvsrs/my_top_level_take_aways_after_having_listened_to/"}, {"author": "AnIdeaMan", "created_utc": 1708707202.0, "link_flair_template_id": "5d7b6946-0047-11e3-ab17-12313b0cf20e", "link_flair_text": "Sales Topic General Discussion", "num_comments": 52, "post_id": "1ay5d1q", "score": 727, "subreddit": "sales", "text": "\"So a few things I just want to get out of the way.\\n\\n* I work B2C\\n* This lead and I spent a lot of time talking, this was not a random cold call\\n* Been in sales a long time, have my share of dead family members stories like we all do\\n* This felt unique because I was confident that the lead himself told me he had died.\\n* I'm not going do anything to circumvent a leads attempts at blocking or ignoring my calls.\\n* This was a lead, not a client, I used the wrong term in my previous post\\n\\nSo the call\\n\\nI called, his wife answered.

He said, \\\"A lot of new sales people will find ways to stay in the office. They'll study the products, rehearse their presentation, meet with peers, engage marketing, try to learn everything they can. But all you need to do is pick up the phone, set up meetings with executives, and then get them to open up to you.\\\"\\n\\nSo that's what I did. And I couldn't believe how wonderful it was. And I remember becoming a top salesperson rather quickly while a few of my new peers did what my mentor warned me against, and got off to much slower starts than I. For the better part of the next 10 years, this trend continued, and I made a lot of money in commissions and was routinely the top rep regardless of where I worked.\\n\\nIt was about 2009 when I started to see a shift happening. My employer at the time started scheduling more internal calls to plan/talk, and started not just requesting but in fact dictating that we enter everything we did into CRM, and mandated our engaging marketing to roll out automated marketing campaigns. At first I blew it off as just noise, but then I started getting increased pressure from within. I remember the irony of that day in early 2010, when the very same day I received a signature on a new logo 3.9M contract that I found by cold calling and that put me over quota for the 4th straight year for that employer, that our COO sent me a public email saying \\\"Boo!\\\" because I was ranked dead last for number of automated emails sent out. I remember taking exception to that, pointing out that what did it matter if I was last in email marketing if I was by far and away the #1 rep overall? But within a few quarters they started attaching our comp plans to our engagement of their marketing automation tool. So I left.\\n\\nBut over the last 13 years, it has gotten worse, no matter where I go.\\n\\nI put together a powerpoint presentation a few weeks ago that was well received by a potential new client. They sponsored another presentation in front of their CFO, and seemed excited about my presentation. But minutes after the meeting ended, my Chief Revenue Officer called me -- \\\"Some of your slides didn't follow our branding,\\\" he said, not. unlike the TPX Cover Page in Office Space. So next time around I lost a couple of hours reformatting our slides to match our corporate-mandated template.\\n\\nToday in our sales meeting, my CRO announced our quarterly numbers were down for the second time in a row. But he made a point to send kudos to three of my peers who have pipelines spread out across all our product groups and have the most engagement in Outreach, our marketing automation platform. Are they at quota? No. Have any of their marketing emails resulted in new clients? No. But the fact they've sent a bazillion emails to prospects who by and large haven't responded is being praised as the standard we go after. Since a year ago, I've closed two new logos by way of cold calling and over 130% of my quota, but I feel like on a daily basis that I\\\"m about to be fired since all I hear is constructive criticism from management about my marketing and limited pipeline, etc..\\n\\nI change jobs a lot. Mostly because I'm a free agent (no equity) and I don't need to make a million dollars a year anymore, so I don't have to put up with the BS like when my family was young. So I'm pretty versed in a lot of company cultures.

Hope you're crushing it going into December; I know it's a tough time of year. I created a post on how I cold call, and I'd love to hear your tips and tricks too. I understand some may disagree with my methodology, and that's okay. Let's keep it civilised.\\n\\n#This Cold Calling Script Booked Me Meetings With The Biggest Law Firms in Adelaide#\\n\\nCold calling is a unique weapon in the salesperson\\u2019s arsenal. I send emails, texts, Linked In messages, and heck, even hand-written letters, but nothing compares to picking up the phone and making the call. It\\u2019s like bringing a bazooka to a knife fight. Here\\u2019s my take on a perfect B2B cold calling script which you might find helpful too.\\n\\nAlternative types of communication are all one-way. Through mediums such as emails, texts, social messages and letters, it doesn\\u2019t require the other person to \\u201cbuy-in\\u201d to the communication. Consider that for a moment.\\n\\nThose contact efforts are easy for the prospect to put-off, save for later, ignore and forget. They definitely serve a purpose, and I believe a great salesperson uses all forms of communication available, but nothing will replace a phone call.\\n\\nPhone calls are a personal, two-way, real-time interaction. I\\u2019ve achieved more in a single call than weeks of touches via other channels. Honestly, while prospects seem \\u201cannoyed\\u201d at cold callers, they also can appreciate the effort of a human wanting to get in contact with them, especially after multiple attempts.\\n\\nBut there is a right way and a wrong way to execute a cold call, and it can be confronting for both the salesman and the prospect. Immediately, people raise their defences when they receive an unsolicited call, so we need to disarm them and instil trust.\\n\\nI\\u2019ll explain the theories behind each section of my call so you can tailor it to your industry and company.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve conducted a lot of research on how to perfect cold calling, because it\\u2019s arguably the most important call in your relationship with a prospect. It\\u2019s the \\u201cfirst date\\u201d of the business world, so you\\u2019d best impress!\\n\\n**The Cold Calling Open/Introduction**\\n\\n*Hi John, this is Michael from XYZ, have I caught you at a bad time?*\\n\\nLet\\u2019s break this down.\\n\\n+ Introduce yourself in a happy tone. Keep it short, succinct and polite. Speak confidently \\u2013 like you would talk to a friend.\\n\\n+ Address the prospect by their first name, to infer you\\u2019re of equal status. While saying \\u201cMr.\\u201d or \\u201cMrs.\\u201d can be a sign of respect, it also communicates that the prospect is more important than you. You\\u2019re calling with a solution to help them and your time is also of great importance; don\\u2019t put the prospect on a pedestal.\\n\\n+ I stopped saying \\u201cMy name is Michael\\u2026\\u201d and started announcing \\u201cThis is Michael\\u2026\\u201d I found this yields more positive responses, perhaps because it conveys a sense of authority. It also cuts the total number of words down.\\n\\n+ I also experienced better results using my first name and the company, but not my last name. I want to remove any unnecessary words, and simplify my message as much as possible for the prospect. Not to mention, when talking to a friend, you\\u2019re on a first name basis.\\n\\n+ I hate it when sales people ask me: \\u201cHow are you?\\u201d I know they don\\u2019t care, and it\\u2019s honestly a waste of time asking. They\\u2019re interrupting my day, they\\u2019re a stranger to me AND they\\u2019re asking me a shallow question? Save that for people you\\u2019re acquainted with. Instead, I\\u2019d prefer to be asked \\u201cHave I caught you at a bad time?\\u201d for four reasons, so I tend to do the same:\\n\\n1) It\\u2019s courteous and shows I respect the prospect\\u2019s time.\\n\\n2) A question encourages the prospect to \\u201cbuy-in\\u201d to the conversation; it takes two to tango.\\n\\n3) When someone receives an unsolicited phone call, their immediate reaction in their mind is negative and hence no, no, no. By asking if I\\u2019ve caught them at a bad time, the answer \\u201cno\\u201d is actually the positive answer. This isn\\u2019t a Jedi mind trick, but it often buys you a bit more time to get your point across.\\n\\n4) Even if I have caught them at a really bad time, the prospect often says \\u201cYes, but can you call back in an hour?\\u201d\\n\\n**The Reason**\\n\\n*The reason I\\u2019m calling is because we\\u2019re helping the big law firms in Adelaide with their property valuation needs, and I thought you might be interested too.* **Then stop talking and wait.**\\n\\n+ The aim of stating the intention of my call cuts to the chase and \\u201csets a hook\\u201d in the prospect. I want to create enough interest so they want to learn more. But you don\\u2019t have to hit the prospect with facts and figures; you just have to arouse curiosity. Remember, people buy from people. Be real and authentic.\\n\\n+ The way you deliver this is crucial. You must be articulate, but excited; clear but upbeat.\\n\\n+ I realise this pitch on paper doesn\\u2019t sound exactly exciting, but the reason it works for me is because (most) lawyers are open to learning about how we can benefit them and their clients.\\n\\n+ I tried different variations such as: \\u201cThe reason I\\u2019m calling is because we help save lawyers time and money with property valuations\\u2026\\u201d but the response I got was that it was \\u201ctoo salesy,\\u201d and they became more hostile over the phone.\\n\\n+ \\u201c\\u2026we\\u2019re helping the big law firms in Adelaide\\u2026\\u201d is social proof that we\\u2019re helping companies LIKE them, and we\\u2019re local. This cements a trust in the prospect that we can actually provide some value to them.\\n\\n+ \\u201c\\u2026and I thought you might be interested too.\\u201d Who could be angry at that? I disarm the prospect but letting them know I\\u2019m not selling anything at this stage; all I\\u2019ve done is explain we\\u2019ve helped others like them and now I\\u2019m thinking we MIGHT be able to help them too. This provides a great avenue for more questions regardless if their response is \\u201cyes\\u201d or \\u201cno.\\u201d\\n\\n+ Then stop talking and wait for a response. In many instances, the prospect has already started talking, but if not, use the silence to create an atmosphere where the prospect HAS to say something. Often the prospect is interested and wants to hear how we can help, but on the odd occasion some they say they\\u2019re not interested.\\n\\n**Qualify**\\n\\nThe aim here is to \\u201cinvestigate\\u201d by asking questions. While my hypothesis is that we can help them, I want to make sure they\\u2019re a good fit for us. There\\u2019s nothing worse than a bad customer, or wasting time with someone that the product/service isn\\u2019t going to suit.\\n\\nUsing a date as a scenario, imagine if you just talked the whole time about how good you are. Personally, that would be an awkward situation. The typical salesperson (myself included) is a type-A, extroverted personality who enjoys conversing, talking and having a laugh. Our job is to ask questions, and then shut up, listen, and absorb what they tell us.\\n\\n**If they say they\\u2019re interested**\\n\\n*Great. If I could ask you real-quick, how many family law clients do you have at the moment?*\\n\\n*On average, what percentage of those would need their property valued?*\\n\\n*Who do you typically use for property valuations?*\\n\\n*What\\u2019s your experience been like with those firms?*\\n\\n*Sounds like we might be a good fit for you. Lawyers find us useful because we service a bigger area across the state, and we also value all types of property. So we\\u2019re able to save you time because we\\u2019re more of a one-stop-shop.*\\n\\n**If they say they\\u2019re not interested**\\n\\n*Oh, that\\u2019s okay, I understand. If I could ask you real-quick, is it a timing issue or something else?*\\n\\nIf it\\u2019s a timing issue, organise a time then and there of when they\\u2019ll be able to give their full attention, and lock them into a meeting via email calendar. If it\\u2019s something else, you should have your objection/complaint responses ready. Then, depending on how that goes, you can re-direct to the questions from the \\u201cinterested\\u201d category.\\n\\n**Closing on a Meeting**\\n\\n*I\\u2019d love to meet with you and learn more about what you do, are you free sometime next week? Preferably Monday morning or Tuesday afternoon if that suits you?*\\n\\n+ Emotional words like \\u201clove\\u201d create impact and show how interested you are, just to learn more about them. The sales process is all about the prospect and getting them to the \\u201cpromise land\\u201d with your solution.\\n\\n+ Narrow down their options to make it psychologically easier for them, but also leave it open to working around them if need be. That\\u2019s polite.\\n\\n**A better way to make sales scripts**\\n\\nWhile scripts can boost your sales, conversations aren\\u2019t linear. It can be difficult to work off of scripts on paper, because when you ask the prospect questions, the responses can vary.

You need to understand that sales is about connecting with people; that is the number 1 most important thing. Everything else is strategy and techniques. But even if you know every technique, if you&#39;re a dick to be around, well\\u2026 you probably won&#39;t make it far in sales.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Choosing the industry**\\n****\\nSo you want to be in sales? selling what exactly?\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIf you can&#39;t install an app on your phone, maybe tech sales isn&#39;t for you.

These could be small hair salons and vape stores or giant operations that use your software as the backbone of their business. You probably need to work in a city/tech hub. |\\n| **Med** | You sell hardware/pharmaceuticals to hospitals/surgeries/local practices. You might manage a list of accounts or you might be hustling hospital to hospital like Will Smith in *The Pursuit of Happiness*. |\\n| **Finance/Insurance** | You sell financial packages to different operations and individuals. Might mean cold-calling an account list, or could be consultative. |\\n| **Hardware/Construction** | Schools, houses, roads and cities need materials to be built. You work with different groups selling equipment, services or supplies. |\\n| **Cars** | You sell rocket ships\\u2026.. It&#39;s car sales\\u2026 you sell, cars. |\\n| **Door to Door** | Knock, knock? - Who&#39;s there? - Give me your money for this solar panel. |\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nSo if you&#39;re looking for advice on 5 out of the 6 of the above, then you just ran out of luck, buddy. I don&#39;t know anything about those industries, so figure it out yourself.\\n\\nTech buddies, however, let&#39;s make some money!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Terminology. What the hell do these words mean?**\\n****\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nSDR, AE, MM, SMB, PROSPECTING, ACV, OPS - What the hell gibberish are you talking about?\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nWe have all been there, a million different abbreviations and references to things nobody has probably ever spoken about before. So let&#39;s break down all the common terms you will come across in the near future.

Your job will be to get in touch with people at different companies, with the goal of piquing their interest enough that you schedule a meeting with them. Done via email, Linkedin, calls or conferences. This meeting is either ran by yourself or an AE and is used to learn more about a company before showing them a demo. You will typically get paid if they show up to a demo. |\\n| SMB AE: Small Medium Business Account Executive | \\u00a330,000 - \\u00a360,000 | \\u00a350,000 - \\u00a3140,000 | Dance, monkey, dance. Your job will be to put on a show and present (demo) to an individual/team at a company with the goal of convincing them to buy your software. This involves showing them a demo, organising follow-up meetings and going through the process to get a decision-maker (DM) to sign a contract with your company. You will typically get paid when they sign. |\\n| MM AE: Mid-Market Account Executive | \\u00a340,000 - \\u00a375,000 | \\u00a360,000 - \\u00a3150,000 | Fancy suit monkey. Your job will be the same as an SMB AE but will involve more steps, with bigger companies. Have you ever gone through the terms and conditions of an agreement before? if not, get used to it. |\\n| ENT AE: Enterprise Account Executive | \\u00a350,000 - \\u00a3100,00 | \\u00a370,000 - \\u00a3250,000 | Fancy suit monkey with top hat and monocle. I see you have been putting on some good demos and somehow lucked out on some big deals. Well now it&#39;s the big leagues. You live by the sword or die by the sword. The length of the interaction and complexity to get a DM to sign a contract has now rapidly increased. Get on a plane, fancy suit monkey, and go dance. |\\n| SALES MANAGER | \\u00a360,000 - \\u00a3120,000 | \\u00a380,000 - \\u00a3200,000 | Smart monkey or dumb monkey? Your job will be to guide your team to victory. To make sure they are motivated, understand their mistakes and are using the best tips and advice to get deals in. You&#39;re likely going to a meeting, but are supporting your team and helping manage internal politics and resources. You get paid based on your team's accumulative sales. |\\n| MD: Managing Director | \\u00a3100,000+ | \\u00a3100,000+ | Very smart monkey or super dumb monkey? Your job is to manage a team of managers and individuals, and to make sure your managers are leading and not bullying their teams. You are helping on big deals and making sure that important clients get what they need so that you can make those dollar dollar bills yo. |\\n| HEAD OF SALES | \\u00a3100,000+ | \\u00a3100,000+ | Very smart monkey or lying monkey? Your job is to manage the managers and work with other heads of the organisation. You are the captain of the ship, the life of the crew is in your hands. |\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n| Terminology | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Cold call | When you call someone who is not expecting your call. Typically done in an attempt to book a meeting. |\\n| Lead | This is the classification within your database for individuals/companies that you are trying to get in contact with/manage a relationship with.  Typically this will be used when &#39;marketing assign a 'lead'&#39;, meaning a individual who has engaged in marketing activities (i.e. clicked a email), in which they now believe there is a higher chance of that person being interested in buying your goods/services. |\\n| Account | This is the terminology used to refer to a company/group that you are trying to get in contact with/manage a relationship with. |\\n| Contact | This is the terminology used to refer to an individual who is  listed under an &#39;account&#39;. I.e. Susan is my contact at ABC company; she is Head of E-commerce. |\\n| Example of a lead, a contact and an account. | Susan at ABC company visits the website of the company you work for. She enters her email address in order to download a webinar. This information is passed onto your marketing team, who gives the information to an SDR and asks the SDR to email/call Susan to try book a meeting. Susan responds saying that she isn&#39;t interested, however, her colleague Tom from Marketing would be a better person to speak with. Susan is now changed from a lead, into a contact.  An account is created for ABC company and an additional contact is created with Tom&#39;s details. This allows you to enter notes for the company and write down what has happened, so that you and your organisation can manage lots of relationships with different organisations at once. |\\n| Disco: discovery call | A discovery call is a meeting with a client, typically booked by an SDR. The goal of this initial meeting is to give the client a basic understanding of what your company can do for them, but also to gain information about the client (i.e. what issues they are experiencing/what they are looking to do to further develop their business), so that you can tailor what you show the client if they decide they want to see a demo next. |\\n| Demo call | A demo is a meeting, typically done either via a screen sharing tool (Google Hangouts, Zoom, Skype) or in-person, where a client is shown a presentation deck or a live demonstration of the software/service they would be getting from your company in exchange for money. |\\n| CRM | Customer Relationship Management. Examples are Salesforce, Hubspot or even a spreadsheet with names and phone numbers. |\\n| OP: Opportunity | An 'op' is created when a demo is marked as qualified, meaning the AE would like to continue speaking with this company and will, therefore, allow the SDR/other departments to get credit for the work they have done. |\\n| Agreement/contract | An agreement between two companies that lays out the products/services offered in exchange for money, along with terms and conditions. |\\n| Legal | Legal department |\\n| SMB | Small- and medium-sized businesses. Companies generating under a set revenue. Could be 5 million, could be 30 million; this depends on what your company sets out. |\\n| Mid Market | Mid-market companies are bigger than startups, but smaller than corporations. Could be a bunch of very smart people growing rapidly, or an old, dumb company slowly dying. Just because they are big, doesn&#39;t mean they have money. Typically over 35 million GBP revenue. Varies, however.

If you don't hit your target, you won't make this much, if you exceed your target, it will be higher.

Be persistent; this is sales after all. I might not respond immediately; keep bothering me. If you&#39;re good, I will do my best to help, if you suck, that&#39;s on you, buddy.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nYour first job in sales will typically start as an SDR. You don&#39;t need a degree to get the role, but for certain companies, you won&#39;t get an interview because of it. The first step you need to do is create a CV:\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**The CV**\\n****\\n[CV Example](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSmwZUCVIWeWZSGlsZINlcFV61_1G9d890GMB8xXaLxh53NvNTH2qCXhMYrrKGBytbiws_lPxNN_hHt/pub)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is my CV from when I first applied for a role in sales. I got interviews. This is not your CV, so don&#39;t copy it, but use it as inspiration.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nTip - Write the CV for the job. Exaggerate the hell out of it, so long as you can back up what you say. You&#39;re about to be a salesperson; if you can&#39;t exaggerate the truth a little bit for your own interests, then you are probably in the wrong profession.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nYour manager will know that you&#39;re exaggerating, but that doesn&#39;t matter. How confidently you say it does. So long as you don&#39;t suck as an SDR, whatever you say is fair game. Don&#39;t lie, but tell the story of the best version of yourself.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**Recruiters**\\n****\\n\\nOne of the very first things you should be doing is trying to find recruiters looking for SDRs. They can easily be found on Linkedin. Send them a connection and then ask if they are open to new candidates and send them your CV and the role you&#39;re looking for. You will also come across them as you apply to jobs directly, talk and meet with as many of them as possible.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nNow, before you get any further: there&#39;s something you need to know about recruiters. They are two-faced ass kissers who will screw you over without a second thought. Joking. Kinda...\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nRecruiters are salespeople too. They have targets to hit of their own by filling roles with candidates. If you are not a good candidate they are not going to want to work with you.\\n\\nSo how can  you be a good candidate? Easy:\\n\\n- ALWAYS show up IN TIME (=15 minutes before, minimum)\\n- Get a new haircut, beard trim/shave\\n- Buy a fitting suit (under \\u00a3200 will do)\\n- Get a pair of nice shoes (under \\u00a3100 is fine)\\n- Bring a notepad and several pens (put 5 of them in the pen holder in your backpack) to your interview\\n- Bring several copies of your CV (inside a leather pouch holder) to your interview\\n- Bring a copy of the job description to your interview\\n- Always answer your phone\\n- Prepare for interviews (seriously, 2 hours prep)\\n- Practice what you are going to say\\n- Tell your recruiter how your interview went immediately after and keep them in every email communication (cc or bcc)\\n- Do what recruiters tell you to do (with exceptions to below)\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nNow\\u2026 you don&#39;t have to be a doormat. The above are the minimum requirements to become across prepared and give you a leg up on like 90% of other candidates. Seriously, the BASICS are more important than pretty much anything else. Nobody is expecting you to be a good salesperson, but they are expecting you to understand that you need to be open to learning.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe key to dealing with recruiters is to set your boundaries from day 1 , but to also to be reasonable. If this is your first role, don&#39;t expect to get the perfect job in your ideal niche/industry. Be open to suggestions made by your recruiter. At the same time, if you give them a hand and they will take an arm. If they think you will accept any role, they will send you to any role, including the crap ones.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nShow up on time and communicate often and clearly with your recruiter. You don&#39;t need to share your minute by minute updates. Just show up to meetings/interviews on time and well prepared, and as soon as the meeting is over call/email the recruiter letting them know how the interview went.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nRecruiters make money from getting you a job. They are partially on your team, but you are not paying them, so don&#39;t expect too much.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Direct outreach**\\n****\\n\\nDidn&#39;t you say you wanted to be a silver-tongued salesperson? Would a smooth-talking, slick back salesperson wait for sales to come to him? Or does he go out and find what he wants and takes it?\\n\\nYou said you wanted to be in sales, so start selling yourself. Look up companies that you find interesting and call up the sales managers/offices of these companies and tell them why they need to hire you. Book your own interview.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Preparing for the interview**\\n****\\n\\nLots of people say you need to prepare for the interview, but they don&#39;t tell you what to prepare.\\n\\nThis is my [cheat-sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vST9IALruYa7Q0-K2FZVFO8fqo0wvp6pOcXKusu-mnRyybv4-EJxfrAJHH_tBiGcwUtBLBP6fczkMMk/pub) for every interview I did. Nobody does this stuff, it's a bit crazy and takes up a lot of time, however, you always want to set yourself apart and this is how to do it.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nYou should be filling this out every time you are going to an interview. You should make one for every person you are going to meet and take them with you to the interview room. Seriously, open up your leather document holder, one side containing the many copies of your CV (give one to everyone you meet - if they don't have their own copy already), the other side holding a cheat-sheet on every single person you're meeting. Let them spot it; they will be impressed! 70% of sales is the presentation. Nothing catches a salesperson's attention like seeing a piece of paper with their own face on it. Prep for your interviews, but most importantly, let them know you prepared.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**The Interview**\\n****\\nGet a smart outfit/suit together, stand tall, shake hands firmly and have a positive attitude.\\n\\nThe goal is to get THEM to talk. Ask them why they are looking for an SDR, what they think would make the perfect one, then write it down and read it back to them. Next show them why you are the solution to their problem.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Post Interview**\\n****\\nAdd they persons who interviewed you on LinkedIn and write them a 'summary email'. Working in sales, we do this for every client we meet. Show that you are doing this yourself already.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Example of a Post interview email and Linkedin message.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vReoHT4y2kxRmAR7cFCS8pfyCAhs6YGyFLU0gDvpNT0rRZLID7khTbNfj_y4wpwtZOMZkFR2Td4g5tn/pub)\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThere are a ton of spelling and grammar mistakes, so better not copy and paste, but rewrite this in your own words! Seriously\\u2026 Do you want the job? Rewrite the damn thing.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nMake sure you include a 'call to action'(CTA), a coffee, a phone call, anything, but don&#39;t wait to be called back, be proactive.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Follow-Ups:**\\n****\\n* Do you think salespeople make 1 demo and then sell the product?\\n* Do you think SDR&#39;s make one phone call and then book a demo?\\n* Follow-up is 90% of the job.\\n* Make the effort to follow-up with the interviewer.\\n* If they don&#39;t answer you 2 days prior to the CTA dates you have suggested. Confirm it with them.\\n* No answer 1 day prior?  - Phone call them!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nWhat are they going to do?, say hey, stop calling me I&#39;m not ready?\\n\\n&quot;Exactly, and if you were a decision-maker at a company I was outreaching I would continue to get in touch. I&#39;m sorry for the persistence, but I think it&#39;s very important to practice what you preach and I&#39;m afraid if that means calling you once a week to keep onto of this sales cycle, then, unfortunately, I&#39;m going to continue. I hope you understand and would want your team to do the same.&quot;\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAny sales manager that doesn&#39;t understand that and is angry that you are chasing him, is a sales manager you don&#39;t want to work for.\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**You got the job!**\\n****\\n\\nWasn&#39;t even difficult was it Mr Beast?\\n\\nYou killed the recruitment process, nailed the interview, ain&#39;t nobody stopping you.\\n\\nMonday you start and now it&#39;s time to make a killing\\u2026. Oh yeah.. Wait.. How do we do that exactly?\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n**How to be an SDR**\\n*****\\n\\nPART 2\\u2026 If you&#39;re interested in learning more, let me know. Maybe I&#39;ll write something. Maybe not?\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nSo if you&#39;re looking for advice on 5 out of the 6 of the above, then you just ran out of luck buddy. I don&#39;t know anything about those industries, so figure it out yourself.\\n\\nTech buddies, however, let&#39;s make some money!\\n\\n&nbsp;\"", "title": "SDR GUIDE - How to become a slick, silver-tongued, money-making SDR.", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/f8q9r9/sdr_guide_how_to_become_a_slick_silvertongued/"}, {"author": "JakeyBoy4168", "created_utc": 1708971380.0, "link_flair_template_id": "bdab74fe-cd00-11e5-a1b1-0ee60891a65b", "link_flair_text": "Sales Careers", "num_comments": 217, "post_id": "1b0ofub", "score": 582, "subreddit": "sales", "text": "\"I saw it coming and, to be honest, I deserved it.

If you keep these 10 in mind, I think they will greatly help most sellers. I\\u2019m always willing to chat more or answer any questions you may have. Just dm me. \\n\\n1. Many in management are in management because they can not sell.\\n\\n2. Your buyers make a purchasing decision. You never ever make a sale.\\n\\n3. Just because you can bulldoze buyers doesn\\u2019t mean you should. Overcoming objections and \\u201cnot taking no for an answer\\u201d will occasionally work. If you choose to work this way though, you\\u2019ll never be anything more than a run rate seller.\\n\\n4. Three way validation: Validate what your management is telling you to do, with what you see your companies top performers doing, and with what you read from top sales thought leaders.\\n\\n5. Detach and function as a consultant when talking to a customer. Your goal is to discover if your product solution honestly makes sense for your buyer. Cheerleader salespeople freak buyers out. If you can successfully detach from your bias, you\\u2019ll function as a partner/trusted advisor and not someone to be suspicious of/argued with.\\n\\n6. The buyer(s) you are working with have a family and career as well. Don\\u2019t ever take advantage/mislead a buyer.\\n\\n7. Don\\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel- replicate what is working well until the market is exhausted. Who are your best customers? Who in the market looks the most like them? What product in your basket seems to work best? If you had to make a basket to win a sweepstakes, would you shoot a layup or a full court shot? \\n\\n8. Not everybody likes you. If you can- team sell. A deal is much more likely to close if you\\u2019ve mobilized a group of people on both sides so that you have multiple POC\\u2019s and potential advocates.\\n\\n9. Be honest with yourself and get those dead deals out of your pipeline. They are maybe making your pipeline reviews easier but they are seriously hampering your chances of being a top performer. \\n\\n10. You can only control what you can control.

I started working in the Financial Industry at 18 years old. Purely commission based, and all sales were done primarily over the phone.\\n\\nTo say it was rough in the beginning is an understatement. I had zero sales experience coming in, and was also a pretty shy kid growing up. As a matter of fact, the reason I got into sales was because my dad thought if I jumped head-first into a sales career it would help me break out of my shyness & anxiety.\\n\\n15 years later, I\\u2019m still going strong and now at the peak of my career. I figured I could dispel a few myths and maybe offer some guidance.\\n\\nI know this has been talked about a bunch of times, but I figured I could contribute my own viewpoint on the subject.\\n\\n**COLD CALLING IS DEAD**\\n\\nNah. I\\u2019m pretty sure I\\u2019ve seen hundreds of blog posts every year for the last 15 years with this exact headline. Most of them were selling digital marketing services, go figure.\\n\\n**ONLY EXTROVERTS SUCCEED IN SALES**\\n\\nAgain, nope. As a matter of fact, some of the most successful people I\\u2019ve come across in the industry were quite introverted. They made ME feel like a social butterfly. To give you an idea, growing up I was a very quiet kid who loved programming and always thought I would have ended up in that field. Never had many friends, so I barely left home. As a matter of fact, I used to spend summer vacations at home pretty much glued to my computer either playing World of Warcraft or learning how to program.\\n\\n**PEOPLE HATE GETTING CALLED**\\n\\nSure, some people get annoyed. Just like with ads on a Youtube video, popup ads on the internet, or commercial breaks on your TV. But if you had a good product that served who you were calling, you\\u2019ll come to realize that those same people might actually be grateful for your call. It\\u2019s just like any other form of advertisement. If people like what you are offering, great. Deliver on what you are selling and everyone wins. If not, no worries, move on from the call. And don\\u2019t call people that are on the DNC. 80% of my client base started with an introductory phone call from me. The other 20% are referrals. I\\u2019ve had clients stick around with me for over 10 years and have built very close relationships with many of them. All from a quick phone call that they weren\\u2019t expecting.\\n\\n**COLD CALLING IS A NUMBERS GAME**\\n\\nI\\u2019m sure you\\u2019ve heard this many times before. \\u201cKeep dialing, it\\u2019s a numbers game\\u201d Or \\u201cCold calling is a contact sport, just keep at it.\\u201d It\\u2019s always oversimplified. Let me break it down for you. Know your numbers. Know your closing rate, contact rate, cold lead to warm lead/prospect rate. You should be writing everything down daily. Over time if you see that you\\u2019re consistently closing 10% of your warm leads, then you know that you need roughly 10 warm leads/qualified prospects to close a deal. That\\u2019s when it becomes a \\u201cnumbers game.\\u201d Obviously, you should try and improve your closing rate, and any other measurable statistic that you have control over. Look at your cold-calling as a business. You should know every statistic possible about your calls. You should be able to predict future revenue based on your data - just like any other business would.\\n\\nA couple of tips for those struggling or thinking about getting into cold calling:\\n\\n* Know your customer profile & average turnaround time to sell your product. Not everyone is going to be a lead or a prospect. And you definitely do not want to be blindly pitching everyone your service. You should have a list of \\u201cqualifying\\u201d questions that you bring up in conversation to see if it\\u2019s a good fit or not. If they are a good fit, and would be happy to work with you and your services, great. You\\u2019ve got a new warm lead. You don\\u2019t want to be wasting your time or the prospect's time presenting your service if there\\u2019s no need.\\n* Smiling works. You don\\u2019t want to come off as robotic or monotone. I could go on about tonality and how important it is in your presentation - but the key is to sound sincere and helpful, really as simple as that. Smiling is disarming and contagious and even though they can\\u2019t see you, the prospect on the other line can definitely hear the difference.\\n* DISCIPLINE is one of the most important factors in cold calling success. I\\u2019ve seen guys have amazing months and then stop cold calling. Eventually, they start wondering why they aren\\u2019t having as much success as before, go into a negative spiral and eventually quit. Then they go to another company hoping things will magically change and end up doing the same thing. No matter your success levels, if cold calling is your primary way of getting business you just simply can't stop. Prospecting for new business is something that needs to be done as often as you can. If you lack time because you have a substantial book of business that you need to service, look into hiring callers for you. If it\\u2019s a time management issue, then you need to fix that. To illustrate, imagine your local pizza shop had a great promotion and had the busiest month as far as new customers since their inception. The next month they put up a sign saying \\u201cSorry, we aren\\u2019t taking any new customers at this time.\\u201d That obviously will never happen. But that\\u2019s effectively what you are doing once you stop cold calling no matter where you are in your business.\\n* Understand that some months will be great, some won\\u2019t. Some days you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re on top of the world and other days you\\u2019ll be down in the dumps. This is why discipline is important. You need to be able to train yourself to get the job done no matter what. That doesn\\u2019t mean that you have to be closing deals everyday (unless it\\u2019s a requirement of your job/business.) What it means is you need to show up and put the effort in making your dials, follow-ups, and whatever else your job entails.  \\n\\n\\nHope it helps. Good luck guys.\"", "title": "My thoughts on cold calling after 15 years...", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/jgxoad/my_thoughts_on_cold_calling_after_15_years/"}, {"author": "Sailing_4th", "created_utc": 1603661646.0, "link_flair_template_id": "257e55e4-0047-11e3-b199-12313b0eb082", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "num_comments": 47, "post_id": "ji1oyl", "score": 515, "subreddit": "sales", "text": "\"After almost 20 years of sales you learn quite a bit and I thought I\\u2019d share some of that with y\\u2019all during this pandemic.\\n\\nCurrently I work for a large technology company in the enterprise cloud space and am involved in some of the most unique and incredibly rewarding engagements. I was offered a role with $375k OTE with a major company but turned it down because I can do just as much, if not more where I\\u2019m at. But also from a lifestyle standpoint I\\u2019m happy today.\\n\\nBut to get there it took time and if I had to break down my experience I'd say this:\\n\\n1. There are no shortcuts. To get to a role where \\\"it's not work if you enjoy what you do\\\" requires you to work the jobs you don't like to do to get there.\\n\\n2. Corporate America has no loyalty. You might have a good relationship with some people in the organization but when dollars and cents get involved you're just another FTE or number.\\u00a0Complacency is your enemy.\\n\\n3. People do business with people they like. All the sales books you read are good when you're starting out but once you're working with millions of dollars on the negotiating table, its you they're buying from.\\n\\n4. Office politics is crucial to your success. It can help you get more leads, process your orders faster, get you promotions and make you a lot more money or give you more flexibility with your time. Be nice to everyone if even they can't do anything for you.\\n\\n5. Take notes. Lots and lots of notes. When the sales cycles get long on large contracts, people come and go on both sides of the table. It helps to have important details documented. Microsoft One Note is your friend.\\n\\n6. Disqualifying opportunities quickly. You learn not to waste time on a wild goose chase so be comfortable in saying no to a possible engagement early on and people will respect you for it.\\n\\n7. Never take your foot off the pedal. If you close a big deal, take a day to celebrate but then keep pressing.\\u00a0Momentum is everything in sales. It also helps prevent your pay from going up and down each month.\\n\\n8. Use technology to your advantage. Automate things that you can, I mentioned One Note earlier, use your calendar to track your time, put notes in your CRM like Salesforce. Find out how to use filters and think of creative ways to find opportunities that are low hanging fruit.\\n\\n9. Become a good story teller. Remember that you\\u2019re helping someone find a solution to a problem. Share stories of how you\\u2019ve helped other customers and don\\u2019t spend too much time being technical unless it\\u2019s a technical conversation.\\n\\n10. It\\u2019s ok to cross into the grey area. Sometimes you need to push your organization to make exceptions to win a deal. It\\u2019s ok to ask for those, just be particular about which ones are worth fighting for.\\n\\n11. Take time off. Nothing bothers me more when someone tells me they\\u2019re such a great employee because they only took 2 days off this year. Taking time off, traveling, spending time with loved ones gives you the fuel you need to stay motivated.\\n\\n12. Follow through on commitments. If you\\u2019re running behind on getting something back to a client (internal or external), email or call them and let them know there\\u2019s a delay but you haven\\u2019t forgotten about them. This goes a long way in building credibility.\\n\\n13. Don\\u2019t burn bridges. I actually wound up back in tech sales because a former employee of mine wound up becoming a recruiter and found that opportunity for me. We were never best friends and she was always a pain in my ass but we respected each other at work. You will run into people over and over again.\\n\\n14. Be humble. Even with my experience, I often come across people who are just brilliant sales people with so much to learn from. Take the time to thank them and ask if you can pick their brain.\\n\\nI\\u2019m sure I can spend hours thinking of more but these are the most immediate ones that came to mind.\"", "title": "New to sales or considering working in sales?

He had only 2 fingers on one hand and was your Al Bundy but... One who made bank. Taught me to anticipate objections and upsell. Ex: woman wanted two shoes to try on, he brings out another 3, then walks her to handbags, then jewelry. And exquisite customer care... We had old school black binders filled with our clients. He would call them and let them know a size X in this shoe came in and would look amazing on them... The customers are.it.up... He would rmemeber everything about them and detail it in his black book. \\n\\nThis was back when people died of aids. And he fell down to it. He had rolls royces lined around the funeral from client's giving their respects to him.  Sobbing. He was their friend, confidant, support system in many ways. \\n\\n2-  When I was still in that bubbly happy female in sales phase when in corporate enterprise sales... I shadowed a  man, dry bone personality, giant introvert. Listened exquisitely. Left long pauses... So when he had something to say the prospect listened and he had instant respect. I learned the importance of executive gravitas from him and changed my entire sales persona. \\n\\n3- A slayer female sales exec that I had the luck to take me under her wing and to this day. I won't ever have her level of sales acumen, ever. Some people are just golden.

And I know that some guys can be sexist pigs. But recently I've been around some real shitheads.\\n\\nMost of them are Boomers. And I don't know if it's because I'm \\\"one of the guys,\\\" and so they think they can be open around me, or what, but I've heard some truly awful shit.\\n\\nThese guys will talk about women's bodies, make sure every guy in the group sees the hot girl at the booth, openly talk about cheating on their wives, and tell stories of affairs with coworkers, clients, or competitors.\\n\\nOne group of guys was recently telling me which strip clubs in a particular town have dancers that also hook. These guys are married and have children. They work for companies whose values are \\\"Integrity\\\" or \\\"Tranparency.\\\"\\n\\nThey are also often the same guys that don't care about the success of the customer, only the sale. They want to close the deal, get the commission, fuck the secretary, and then move on to the next deal.\\n\\nI've started calling out the bullshit. A sales leader recently tried to have me scope out hot college girls with him at lunch, and I told him I wasn't like that, that I was happily married, and that I wasn't interested in looking at girls or talking like that. He looked at me like I had three heads. But I just ignored it and started talking about work stuff and sports.\\n\\nAnyway, I don't know what the point of this post is. Just bitching, I guess. I have a wife and a daughter, and to know that old dudes out there ogle over their bodies in public grosses me out and pisses me off. I don't want to work with guys that are like that. \\n\\nBe better, guys.
