I (28F) have been applying for jobs since the start of 2024. I've been at my current job almost 2 years, and though I enjoy it, I'd been wanting to leave for a few reasons: 1) general fatigue and burnout, 2) a long commute and 3) wanting to make a higher salary. My commute was initially fine but got a lot longer after I moved to the suburbs to live with my partner. Let's call him Jack.\n\nA few days ago, I had a third interview with a company I really like. They called me the next day to say they reached out to my references. I know my references are still submitting materials, but I am hoping to have a response soon. When I first started applying, I told myself I'd accept the job if I got an offer, as long as it was higher than my current salary.\n\nWell, fast forward a couple days. Jack and I broke up. We'd been having some issues but I still didn't expect things to go the way they did, when they did. I am now staying at a friend's place, and hoping to move somewhere more stable soon. I'm safe but heartbroken and sad and mentally drained. I loved Jack (still do) and it was my longest relationship and first time living with an SO.\n\nIn light of my breakup, I've been having second thoughts about this potential new job. My current boss has been very supportive and kind throughout my situation, though he does not know about the interviews. Work has also slowed down for a bit. I am now living closer to the office and plan to get a place within a 30-ish minute drive from work. Also, switching jobs would mean switching insurance, and that feels tricky given some physical & mental health stuff I need to take care of. \n\nAlong with all that, I don't know if I have the mental energy to start a whole new job and leave my current one. I know healing takes time, and things will get better, but I really don't know how long this transition will take.\n\nWould it be wrong to decline the job offer if I got one? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Would appreciate your insights.

I\u2019ve been trying to get into a field linked to my degree (history/heritage), but I\u2019m always on the last round of interviews and then never hired. That lasted almost seven months, during which I started volunteering and undertaking a business diploma online to get qualified, remain busy, and keep my options open.\n\nToday, the charity with which I\u2019ve been volunteering at offered me a job and I accepted, and I was elated to finally have some security back in my life. It\u2019s another retail role but this time in a bookshop, which is more in alignment with my longer term goals of getting into heritage publishing. It also pays better than my last job, with a pension scheme and full time contract. Needless to say, I was so excited to finally take some steps forward.\n\nI just broke the news to my Dad, and he replied with a very sarcastic, disinterested \u201cthank god for that. Not like it\u2019s hard to get into retail\u201d, and just walked away. I\u2019m trying to see his point of view with compassion, as I know it\u2019s not easy having your adult child live with you while they\u2019re unemployed, and I know he just wants the best for me and wants me to get another job in my dream field. But considering my experiences over the last few months, I just kind of needed a bit more enthusiasm you know. This new job will give me income, a chance to start a pension, and allow me funds to either save for an MA degree or rent a room elsewhere closer to where the jobs in my field is (most of my rejections came from the fact I was too far from the workplace or that I didn\u2019t drive. I drive now, but I\u2019m still a firm believer in going where the work is).\n\nNot sure if this was a rant or a cry for help lol, but it really dampened what should have been a relieving moment for me, and now I feel almost ashamed to have been so excited over a retail job even though I know how valid and demanding this industry is. I know my situation has probably had its impact on him emotionally as well, but I just expected more excitement or support from him after having been through so much rejection and frustration these last few months.

I (28F) have been applying for jobs since the start of 2024. I've been at my current job almost 2 years, and though I enjoy it, I'd been wanting to leave for a few reasons: 1) general fatigue and burnout, 2) a long commute and 3) wanting to make a higher salary. My commute was initially fine but got a lot longer after I moved to the suburbs to live with my partner. Let's call him Jack.\n\nA few days ago, I had a third interview with a company I really like. They called me the next day to say they reached out to my references. I know my references are still submitting materials, but I am hoping to have a response soon. When I first started applying, I told myself I'd accept the job if I got an offer, as long as it was higher than my current salary.\n\nWell, fast forward a couple days. Jack and I broke up. We'd been having some issues but I still didn't expect things to go the way they did, when they did. I am now staying at a friend's place, and hoping to move somewhere more stable soon. I'm safe but heartbroken and sad and mentally drained. I loved Jack (still do) and it was my longest relationship and first time living with an SO.\n\nIn light of my breakup, I've been having second thoughts about this potential new job. My current boss has been very supportive and kind throughout my situation, though he does not know about the interviews. Work has also slowed down for a bit. I am now living closer to the office and plan to get a place within a 30-ish minute drive from work. Also, switching jobs would mean switching insurance, and that feels tricky given some physical & mental health stuff I need to take care of. \n\nAlong with all that, I don't know if I have the mental energy to start a whole new job and leave my current one.

He does absolutely nothing. He takes credit for shit we do. He's casually racist and flies off the handle at a moments notice if he is in a bad mood. He makes fun of hourly people to their faces. I genuinely cannot stand him. \n\nI reached out to his boss earlier tonight (he really likes me) to ask if I could come in early to talk with him and I'm just gonna lay it all out. He might lose his job and he has no family in the area (only moved here because his ex took the kids away and came here) and it could cost him a lot in his custody battle. I don't care anymore. I am losing my mind and he's making an otherwise good job into hell. \n\nSorry for all the parentheticals lol", "title": "My boss is destroying my sanity", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1be9d33/my_boss_is_destroying_my_sanity/"}, {"author": "Snowwstorm", "author_flair_text": null, "clicked": false, "created_utc": 1710379090.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "1be8ure", "is_original_content": false, "is_self": true, "locked": false, "name": "t3_1be8ure", "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/jobs/comments/1be8ure/which_schedule_would_you_prefer_a_typical_95_or_2/", "saved": false, "score": 1, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "text": "I have the opportunity to work either.

Myself and the other managers have actively talked about how much easier it is when he takes a day off or leaves early. Every month or so he gets reprimanded from the higher ups for doing one thing wrong or another (I honestly think theyre trying to push him out), and then he immediately buckles down and cares about the job for about 2 days, makes our lives hell trying to not just hit but surpass every metric known to man, and then slowly goes back to his normal state of being, which is staring at his phone watching tiktoks on silent (sometimes!) and ignoring anything we're saying while sitting directly behind us. He does absolutely nothing. He takes credit for shit we do. He's casually racist and flies off the handle at a moments notice if he is in a bad mood. He makes fun of hourly people to their faces. I genuinely cannot stand him. \n\nI reached out to his boss earlier tonight (he really likes me) to ask if I could come in early to talk with him and I'm just gonna lay it all out. He might lose his job and he has no family in the area (only moved here because his ex took the kids away and came here) and it could cost him a lot in his custody battle. I don't care anymore.

But if someone is getting an offer, shouldn't I know by now? \n\nAll that to say - do I follow up again tomorrow morning? Do I wait till next week?\n\nI also interviewed with and followed up with a thank you with the VP of HR - is it out of line to message her with a follow up? \n\nBasically my anxiety is driving me insane and I just would like an answer. The ghosting is INCREDIBLY out of character. I mean, I was told \"it was awesome\" to have another interview with me, the president of the company told me he was really impressed with me. I'm just really confused and could use either some reassurance or a wake up call.

I (28F) have been applying for jobs since the start of 2024. I've been at my current job almost 2 years, and though I enjoy it, I'd been wanting to leave for a few reasons: 1) general fatigue and burnout, 2) a long commute and 3) wanting to make a higher salary. My commute was initially fine but got a lot longer after I moved to the suburbs to live with my partner. Let's call him Jack.\n\nA few days ago, I had a third interview with a company I really like. They called me the next day to say they reached out to my references. I know my references are still submitting materials, but I am hoping to have a response soon. When I first started applying, I told myself I'd accept the job if I got an offer, as long as it was higher than my current salary.\n\nWell, fast forward a couple days. Jack and I broke up. We'd been having some issues but I still didn't expect things to go the way they did, when they did. I am now staying at a friend's place, and hoping to move somewhere more stable soon. I'm safe but heartbroken and sad and mentally drained. I loved Jack (still do) and it was my longest relationship and first time living with an SO.\n\nIn light of my breakup, I've been having second thoughts about this potential new job. My current boss has been very supportive and kind throughout my situation, though he does not know about the interviews. Work has also slowed down for a bit. I am now living closer to the office and plan to get a place within a 30-ish minute drive from work. Also, switching jobs would mean switching insurance, and that feels tricky given some physical & mental health stuff I need to take care of. \n\nAlong with all that, I don't know if I have the mental energy to start a whole new job and leave my current one. I know healing takes time, and things will get better, but I really don't know how long this transition will take.\n\nWould it be wrong to decline the job offer if I got one? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Would appreciate your insights.

I (28F) have been applying for jobs since the start of 2024. I've been at my current job almost 2 years, and though I enjoy it, I'd been wanting to leave for a few reasons: 1) general fatigue and burnout, 2) a long commute and 3) wanting to make a higher salary. My commute was initially fine but got a lot longer after I moved to the suburbs to live with my partner. Let's call him Jack.\n\nA few days ago, I had a third interview with a company I really like. They called me the next day to say they reached out to my references. I know my references are still submitting materials, but I am hoping to have a response soon. When I first started applying, I told myself I'd accept the job if I got an offer, as long as it was higher than my current salary.\n\nWell, fast forward a couple days. Jack and I broke up. We'd been having some issues but I still didn't expect things to go the way they did, when they did. I am now staying at a friend's place, and hoping to move somewhere more stable soon. I'm safe but heartbroken and sad and mentally drained. I loved Jack (still do) and it was my longest relationship and first time living with an SO.\n\nIn light of my breakup, I've been having second thoughts about this potential new job. My current boss has been very supportive and kind throughout my situation, though he does not know about the interviews. Work has also slowed down for a bit. I am now living closer to the office and plan to get a place within a 30-ish minute drive from work. Also, switching jobs would mean switching insurance, and that feels tricky given some physical & mental health stuff I need to take care of. \n\nAlong with all that, I don't know if I have the mental energy to start a whole new job and leave my current one. I know healing takes time, and things will get better, but I really don't know how long this transition will take.\n\nWould it be wrong to decline the job offer if I got one? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Would appreciate your insights.

I\u2019ve been trying to get into a field linked to my degree (history/heritage), but I\u2019m always on the last round of interviews and then never hired.

It\u2019s another retail role but this time in a bookshop, which is more in alignment with my longer term goals of getting into heritage publishing. It also pays better than my last job, with a pension scheme and full time contract.

But considering my experiences over the last few months, I just kind of needed a bit more enthusiasm you know. This new job will give me income, a chance to start a pension, and allow me funds to either save for an MA degree or rent a room elsewhere closer to where the jobs in my field is (most of my rejections came from the fact I was too far from the workplace or that I didn\u2019t drive. I drive now, but I\u2019m still a firm believer in going where the work is).\n\nNot sure if this was a rant or a cry for help lol, but it really dampened what should have been a relieving moment for me, and now I feel almost ashamed to have been so excited over a retail job even though I know how valid and demanding this industry is.

So I find that the position could be very healing for me. \n\nThe remote work is ideal because I\u2019d love to be there (somewhat) once my husband comes home (around 3pm) and we can pick our kid up from daycare / get a nanny. I\u2019m glad they have maternity leave. It\u2019s an organization I\u2019m passionate about. One that influenced and helped me when I was a young girl walking with my mother through her cancer journey. \n\nThe only negative is that the pay is 5000 less than what I\u2019m making now and I wouldn\u2019t be in a senior position (and I\u2019ve wanted to be in a senior position for the last three years) (but I\u2019m also early on in my career\u2026I graduated 5 years ago so there is still so much time) \n\n\nI also haven\u2019t received and offer yet. So all of this worrying may be a moot point. \n\n\nCan someone give me some guidance on why you would do? \n\nIf I take the emotion out of my current job / how much I like everyone and the culture I would 100% go with the cancer research job because it aligns with the lifestyle I want and an organization that I am passionate about. \n\n\nThanks everyone! \n\n", "title": "Leaving a company after a few weeks?

My understanding of the differences between the two roles is that acting means the person that has the job is currently away.  There were two recent examples of this in my current company.  In one case, the permanent person took on an interim position higher up the chain.  So the person that replaced permanent person went into an acting role since the permanent person was not really gone.\n\nThe other case involved a person that was about to get fired.  While my company worked out (legal) details of letting that person go, they put an acting person in place.  So in both cases the person with the job was not technically gone, which it what I generally see when there in a interim person.  In those cases, the permanent person is gone gone.\n\nPerhaps I am not completely understanding the two designations, but sitting here romanticizing the possibility of getting the job has me wondering at every angle.

I\u2019m coming up on two years at my job, I have been doing the same work thus far, literally nothing has changed.\n\nI started getting bullied by one receptionist pretty early on. Snide comments, eye rolls, catty mean girl shit. Still, I was polite and did what was asked. Then I started getting tired of being a doormat so i would stick up for myself as professionally as I could. I ended up reporting her because her treatment of me was starting to impact my work and she was becoming more aggressive in how she spoke to me. She loved to berate me in front of customers to humiliate me.\n\nOver the last two years, she\u2019s been reported by me twice, and other staff members for the same treatment, she ended up getting promoted. And we were told essentially she\u2019d never be fired and she\u2019s an asset. \n\nAfter that, another manager and a coworker started to tell my supervisor every little mistake I made and it\u2019s landed me on a PIP. (It\u2019s evident I\u2019ll be getting fired. So I\u2019m looking for a job) \n\nThe pip has no date (30, 60, or 90 days) and I was told to let them know of anything they can do to help.

So I find that the position could be very healing for me. \n\nThe remote work is ideal because I\u2019d love to be there (somewhat) once my husband comes home (around 3pm) and we can pick our kid up from daycare / get a nanny. I\u2019m glad they have maternity leave. It\u2019s an organization I\u2019m passionate about. One that influenced and helped me when I was a young girl walking with my mother through her cancer journey. \n\nThe only negative is that the pay is 5000 less than what I\u2019m making now and I wouldn\u2019t be in a senior position (and I\u2019ve wanted to be in a senior position for the last three years) (but I\u2019m also early on in my career\u2026I graduated 5 years ago so there is still so much time) \n\n\nI also haven\u2019t received and offer yet. So all of this worrying may be a moot point. \n\n\nCan someone give me some guidance on why you would do? \n\nIf I take the emotion out of my current job / how much I like everyone and the culture I would 100% go with the cancer research job because it aligns with the lifestyle I want and an organization that I am passionate about. \n\n\nThanks everyone! \n\n", "title": "Leaving a company after a few weeks?

When I come across posts regarding someone looking for a new job/complaining about their current one and looking for suggestions there will often be quite a few responses recommending the OP pick up a trade (regardless of the OP's background or goals).\n\nHowever, when the OP expresses no such interest in entering the trades, they are then either slammed as being lazy, entitled, afraid of hard work or told to be \"realistic\" implying that the trades are their only viable career options. This has happened to me a few times too.\n\nHonestly why the hostility? So what if someone isn't interested in blue collar work out of the plethora of potential career paths. No need to demean the inquirer. Come up with another idea and actually listen to the OP instead of throwing the half-assed, rubber-stamp answer \"Dude, go pick up a trade!\" or just simply move on after giving free advice.\n\nThere's a good reason for the labor shortage. Its backbreaking, the pay is grossly exaggerated and its actually fairly complex work. Sure you'll always be in-demand but at an enormous cost to your health and well being. Its funny and disheartening to see posters gloat about getting $25-30 an hour as a tradesman. I made more than that as an intern.\n\nTo those who work in trades and actually enjoy the job and are good at it, awesome!

Last October, I started a new job and everything was going somehow smoothly until two days ago when my manager's attitude towards me changed drastically.

This abrupt request has left me questioning whether he's setting me up for failure during my probation period, which is due to end next month. \n\nI'm torn about what to do next.

Of course they are going to say everything is fine and dandy. certain media has its favored candidates and reports what their official stance is. \n2. **federal interest rates:** [BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are 'arguably the most powerful cartel in human history', Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy says.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-state-street-vanguard-arguably-211002034.html) These three companies on a 30% stake in 90% of the S&P 500 companies. It is well known that as long as the board members of the companies they invest in follow their requests, they will not exercise voting rights to replace those board members. [all three have $20 trillion in managed assets](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/giant-conglomerates-control-world-omkar-chitnis/). the debt (and payments of) for those \"assets\" cut into the returns on investment (dividends). What I would do is have these companies advertise for jobs that they never intend to fill to make the unemployment rate look artificially low, thus the Fed will not raise interest rates. if the fed raises interest rates by .25% (0.0025), then on $1trillion of debt, they owe an additional $2.5 billion overnight.\n3. **ppp (pandemic) loans:** I do not fully understand the repayment mechanism of these things (I sucked in accounting), but there is a way that if a company cannot fill positions, it qualifies for loan forgiveness. Companies advertise for positions they never intend to fill so they have documentation.\n4. **grants and other loans:** by appearing to have open positions, a company can appear to be growing. This creates the appearance of need so that they can qualify for different grants and loans.\n5. **overhearing of 2021:** companies, especially tech companies over hired in 2021. With the slowing economy, we are seeing major layoffs, especially in e-commerce and the tech sector. Many of these companies are hedging their bets, and building applicant pipelines. This is because if the economy starts a miraculous recovery, next year, they are prepared to hire.\n6. **AI:** companies are over relying on AI. AI is allowing for massive job cuts for people who create content. It is also creeping in to our delivery drivers and livery (taxi) drivers. Again, I believe that companies are hedging their bets and creating applicant pipelines in the event that AI does not deliver what was promised.\n7. **Data collection:** AI is essentially advanced data analysis. It combines machine learning within intuitiveness. It allows for the reading and processing of data and trending/learning how to scale never before seen. The biggest problem is that a handful of companies have the greatest amount of data siloed. (Think google, banks, media, healthcare, etc.) So how does a smaller company compete? The cheapest way to collect data is to have people voluntarily give it. While there is a cost to posting jobs, gathering resumes is one of the cheapest and most efficient ways to compile personal data.\n8. **make the job site look good:** [just like the dating site Ashley Madison was accused of almost all it's female profiles being fake to attract men willing to pay for the service](https://theweek.com/64457/ashley-madison-nearly-all-female-accounts-were-fake-or-dormant), so too job sites will post jobs that have been filled. This happened to someone that I personally know; she posted a job for her company, when they filled the job she took the posting down. two weeks later, she saw the job reposted. (this could be human error, a glitch, I do not know or want to speculate). \n9. [**applicant tracking systems suck!**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jameshudson/2024/01/10/why-job-listings-get-reposted-and-why-you-should-apply-to-them-anyway/?sh=67f31c3c67c1) we all know this. it has been suggests that ATS places too much emphasis on keywords and fails to take into account a candidate's skills, experience, or qualifications. As a result, many qualified candidates are overlooked .[SHRM reported: Some AI-based systems may be increasing the worker shortages they were built to address.](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/hr-magazine/applicant-tracking-system-hurting-recruiting-efforts)\n10. **good old fashioned scams:** a good number of job postings are just outright scams. Whether they are to collect data, steal identities, or try and sell a product two people in dire circumstances, they are advertising real jobs.\n\nFinally here two great articles that I found on LinkedIN: [Why Are Jobs Being Reposted](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-jobs-being-reposted-smita-philip/) and [Is your Applicant Tracking System (ATS) destroying your candidate experience? Probably](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-applicant-tracking-system-ats-destroying-candidate-jim-wahl/).

When I come across posts regarding someone looking for a new job/complaining about their current one and looking for suggestions there will often be quite a few responses recommending the OP pick up a trade (regardless of the OP's background or goals).\n\nHowever, when the OP expresses no such interest in entering the trades, they are then either slammed as being lazy, entitled, afraid of hard work or told to be \"realistic\" implying that the trades are their only viable career options.

Its backbreaking, the pay is grossly exaggerated and its actually fairly complex work. Sure you'll always be in-demand but at an enormous cost to your health and well being.

It\u2019s full time in office & the commute isn\u2019t too terrible\u2026I come home every day and tell my husband \u201cI\u2019m having a really good time\u2026I really like everyone.\u201d\nI\u2019m finally in a senior position and am making fine money. It\u2019s a gift.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker. They have no paid maternity leave - what I would be allowed is two weeks of my saved PTO & then I\u2019d go on disability for 6 weeks at 60% of my pay\u2026so I\u2019d be leaving my kid after 8 weeks. \n\nI was not informed about the non existent maternity leave policy before I started. That would have been a major factor in my decision making process because I would like to start trying to have a family by mid year. \n\nWhen I informed HR on this they said that they \u201cwere working on it\u201d and \u201creally want to have something in place by December 1\u201d which doesn\u2019t align with my desired timeline. They also said that if I needed earlier accommodation they would be willing to work with me. (It\u2019s a small company so they can go on a case by case basis for now) \n\nBut I don\u2019t want to leave it up to chance and have them potentially reject my request\u2026\n\nI have a job interview for a position at a company who is fully remote, has the standard 6 weeks paid maternity leave / apply for FMLA drill. \n\nI\u2019d be working for a cancer research center on their marketing team\u2026this is an opportunity that aligns closely with my passions as my mother died of cancer when I was 11. So I find that the position could be very healing for me. \n\nThe remote work is ideal because I\u2019d love to be there (somewhat) once my husband comes home (around 3pm) and we can pick our kid up from daycare / get a nanny. I\u2019m glad they have maternity leave. It\u2019s an organization I\u2019m passionate about. One that influenced and helped me when I was a young girl walking with my mother through her cancer journey. \n\nThe only negative is that the pay is 5000 less than what I\u2019m making now and I wouldn\u2019t be in a senior position (and I\u2019ve wanted to be in a senior position for the last three years) (but I\u2019m also early on in my career\u2026I graduated 5 years ago so there is still so much time) \n\n\nI also haven\u2019t received and offer yet. So all of this worrying may be a moot point. \n\n\nCan someone give me some guidance on why you would do? \n\nIf I take the emotion out of my current job / how much I like everyone and the culture I would 100% go with the cancer research job because it aligns with the lifestyle I want and an organization that I am passionate about. \n\n\nThanks everyone! \n\n", "title": "Leaving a company after a few weeks?

I could maybe go faster on emails if I didn\u2019t put as much effort and care as I do into answering questions but I don\u2019t want my quality score to take a hit as a result.

I\u2019ve been trying to get into a field linked to my degree (history/heritage), but I\u2019m always on the last round of interviews and then never hired. That lasted almost seven months, during which I started volunteering and undertaking a business diploma online to get qualified, remain busy, and keep my options open.\n\nToday, the charity with which I\u2019ve been volunteering at offered me a job and I accepted, and I was elated to finally have some security back in my life. It\u2019s another retail role but this time in a bookshop, which is more in alignment with my longer term goals of getting into heritage publishing. It also pays better than my last job, with a pension scheme and full time contract.

But considering my experiences over the last few months, I just kind of needed a bit more enthusiasm you know. This new job will give me income, a chance to start a pension, and allow me funds to either save for an MA degree or rent a room elsewhere closer to where the jobs in my field is (most of my rejections came from the fact I was too far from the workplace or that I didn\u2019t drive. I drive now, but I\u2019m still a firm believer in going where the work is).\n\nNot sure if this was a rant or a cry for help lol, but it really dampened what should have been a relieving moment for me, and now I feel almost ashamed to have been so excited over a retail job even though I know how valid and demanding this industry is. I know my situation has probably had its impact on him emotionally as well, but I just expected more excitement or support from him after having been through so much rejection and frustration these last few months.

I\u2019ve been trying to get into a field linked to my degree (history/heritage), but I\u2019m always on the last round of interviews and then never hired. That lasted almost seven months, during which I started volunteering and undertaking a business diploma online to get qualified, remain busy, and keep my options open.\n\nToday, the charity with which I\u2019ve been volunteering at offered me a job and I accepted, and I was elated to finally have some security back in my life. It\u2019s another retail role but this time in a bookshop, which is more in alignment with my longer term goals of getting into heritage publishing. It also pays better than my last job, with a pension scheme and full time contract. Needless to say, I was so excited to finally take some steps forward.\n\nI just broke the news to my Dad, and he replied with a very sarcastic, disinterested \u201cthank god for that. Not like it\u2019s hard to get into retail\u201d, and just walked away. I\u2019m trying to see his point of view with compassion, as I know it\u2019s not easy having your adult child live with you while they\u2019re unemployed, and I know he just wants the best for me and wants me to get another job in my dream field. But considering my experiences over the last few months, I just kind of needed a bit more enthusiasm you know. This new job will give me income, a chance to start a pension, and allow me funds to either save for an MA degree or rent a room elsewhere closer to where the jobs in my field is (most of my rejections came from the fact I was too far from the workplace or that I didn\u2019t drive. I drive now, but I\u2019m still a firm believer in going where the work is).\n\nNot sure if this was a rant or a cry for help lol, but it really dampened what should have been a relieving moment for me, and now I feel almost ashamed to have been so excited over a retail job even though I know how valid and demanding this industry is. I know my situation has probably had its impact on him emotionally as well, but I just expected more excitement or support from him after having been through so much rejection and frustration these last few months.

I (28F) have been applying for jobs since the start of 2024. I've been at my current job almost 2 years, and though I enjoy it, I'd been wanting to leave for a few reasons: 1) general fatigue and burnout, 2) a long commute and 3) wanting to make a higher salary. My commute was initially fine but got a lot longer after I moved to the suburbs to live with my partner. Let's call him Jack.\n\nA few days ago, I had a third interview with a company I really like. They called me the next day to say they reached out to my references. I know my references are still submitting materials, but I am hoping to have a response soon. When I first started applying, I told myself I'd accept the job if I got an offer, as long as it was higher than my current salary.\n\nWell, fast forward a couple days. Jack and I broke up. We'd been having some issues but I still didn't expect things to go the way they did, when they did. I am now staying at a friend's place, and hoping to move somewhere more stable soon. I'm safe but heartbroken and sad and mentally drained. I loved Jack (still do) and it was my longest relationship and first time living with an SO.\n\nIn light of my breakup, I've been having second thoughts about this potential new job. My current boss has been very supportive and kind throughout my situation, though he does not know about the interviews. Work has also slowed down for a bit. I am now living closer to the office and plan to get a place within a 30-ish minute drive from work. Also, switching jobs would mean switching insurance, and that feels tricky given some physical & mental health stuff I need to take care of. \n\nAlong with all that, I don't know if I have the mental energy to start a whole new job and leave my current one. I know healing takes time, and things will get better, but I really don't know how long this transition will take.\n\nWould it be wrong to decline the job offer if I got one?

We'd been having some issues but I still didn't expect things to go the way they did, when they did. I am now staying at a friend's place, and hoping to move somewhere more stable soon. I'm safe but heartbroken and sad and mentally drained. I loved Jack (still do) and it was my longest relationship and first time living with an SO.\n\nIn light of my breakup, I've been having second thoughts about this potential new job. My current boss has been very supportive and kind throughout my situation, though he does not know about the interviews. Work has also slowed down for a bit. I am now living closer to the office and plan to get a place within a 30-ish minute drive from work. Also, switching jobs would mean switching insurance, and that feels tricky given some physical & mental health stuff I need to take care of. \n\nAlong with all that, I don't know if I have the mental energy to start a whole new job and leave my current one. I know healing takes time, and things will get better, but I really don't know how long this transition will take.\n\nWould it be wrong to decline the job offer if I got one? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Would appreciate your insights.

When I come across posts regarding someone looking for a new job/complaining about their current one and looking for suggestions there will often be quite a few responses recommending the OP pick up a trade (regardless of the OP's background or goals).\n\nHowever, when the OP expresses no such interest in entering the trades, they are then either slammed as being lazy, entitled, afraid of hard work or told to be \"realistic\" implying that the trades are their only viable career options.

No need to demean the inquirer. Come up with another idea and actually listen to the OP instead of throwing the half-assed, rubber-stamp answer \"Dude, go pick up a trade!\" or just simply move on after giving free advice.\n\nThere's a good reason for the labor shortage. Its backbreaking, the pay is grossly exaggerated and its actually fairly complex work. Sure you'll always be in-demand but at an enormous cost to your health and well being. Its funny and disheartening to see posters gloat about getting $25-30 an hour as a tradesman.

My commute was initially fine but got a lot longer after I moved to the suburbs to live with my partner. Let's call him Jack.\n\nA few days ago, I had a third interview with a company I really like. They called me the next day to say they reached out to my references. I know my references are still submitting materials, but I am hoping to have a response soon. When I first started applying, I told myself I'd accept the job if I got an offer, as long as it was higher than my current salary.\n\nWell, fast forward a couple days. Jack and I broke up. We'd been having some issues but I still didn't expect things to go the way they did, when they did. I am now staying at a friend's place, and hoping to move somewhere more stable soon. I'm safe but heartbroken and sad and mentally drained. I loved Jack (still do) and it was my longest relationship and first time living with an SO.\n\nIn light of my breakup, I've been having second thoughts about this potential new job. My current boss has been very supportive and kind throughout my situation, though he does not know about the interviews. Work has also slowed down for a bit. I am now living closer to the office and plan to get a place within a 30-ish minute drive from work. Also, switching jobs would mean switching insurance, and that feels tricky given some physical & mental health stuff I need to take care of. \n\nAlong with all that, I don't know if I have the mental energy to start a whole new job and leave my current one. I know healing takes time, and things will get better, but I really don't know how long this transition will take.\n\nWould it be wrong to decline the job offer if I got one?

My understanding of the differences between the two roles is that acting means the person that has the job is currently away.  There were two recent examples of this in my current company.  In one case, the permanent person took on an interim position higher up the chain.  So the person that replaced permanent person went into an acting role since the permanent person was not really gone.\n\nThe other case involved a person that was about to get fired.  While my company worked out (legal) details of letting that person go, they put an acting person in place.  So in both cases the person with the job was not technically gone, which it what I generally see when there in a interim person.  In those cases, the permanent person is gone gone.\n\nPerhaps I am not completely understanding the two designations, but sitting here romanticizing the possibility of getting the job has me wondering at every angle.

It\u2019s full time in office & the commute isn\u2019t too terrible\u2026I come home every day and tell my husband \u201cI\u2019m having a really good time\u2026I really like everyone.\u201d\nI\u2019m finally in a senior position and am making fine money. It\u2019s a gift.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker. They have no paid maternity leave - what I would be allowed is two weeks of my saved PTO & then I\u2019d go on disability for 6 weeks at 60% of my pay\u2026so I\u2019d be leaving my kid after 8 weeks. \n\nI was not informed about the non existent maternity leave policy before I started. That would have been a major factor in my decision making process because I would like to start trying to have a family by mid year. \n\nWhen I informed HR on this they said that they \u201cwere working on it\u201d and \u201creally want to have something in place by December 1\u201d which doesn\u2019t align with my desired timeline. They also said that if I needed earlier accommodation they would be willing to work with me. (It\u2019s a small company so they can go on a case by case basis for now) \n\nBut I don\u2019t want to leave it up to chance and have them potentially reject my request\u2026\n\nI have a job interview for a position at a company who is fully remote, has the standard 6 weeks paid maternity leave / apply for FMLA drill. \n\nI\u2019d be working for a cancer research center on their marketing team\u2026this is an opportunity that aligns closely with my passions as my mother died of cancer when I was 11. So I find that the position could be very healing for me. \n\nThe remote work is ideal because I\u2019d love to be there (somewhat) once my husband comes home (around 3pm) and we can pick our kid up from daycare / get a nanny. I\u2019m glad they have maternity leave. It\u2019s an organization I\u2019m passionate about. One that influenced and helped me when I was a young girl walking with my mother through her cancer journey. \n\nThe only negative is that the pay is 5000 less than what I\u2019m making now and I wouldn\u2019t be in a senior position (and I\u2019ve wanted to be in a senior position for the last three years) (but I\u2019m also early on in my career\u2026I graduated 5 years ago so there is still so much time) \n\n\nI also haven\u2019t received and offer yet. So all of this worrying may be a moot point. \n\n\nCan someone give me some guidance on why you would do? \n\nIf I take the emotion out of my current job / how much I like everyone and the culture I would 100% go with the cancer research job because it aligns with the lifestyle I want and an organization that I am passionate about. \n\n\nThanks everyone! \n\n", "title": "Leaving a company after a few weeks?

For the last two years of my degree, and since graduating, I have had the same job. I was a psychology student, and I work for a psychologist who runs a reading programme for children with ADHD and dyslexia, delivering the programme to children remotely. \n\nThis has been an incredibly part-time job, and I only work anywhere from 3-8 hours a week. Once a month, myself and two others who have the same job as me have a supervision meeting with our boss, where we give updates on the progress of the children we teach. Personal circumstances interrupted my job search as my degree was finishing and meant I wound up moving home after university. Naturally, this very irregular job is limiting my income and I'm at a point now where I'm able and need to find full-time work, so in the last month or so I have become a lot more serious in my job search. \n\nIt has, however, become abundantly clear that my boss just does not like me, and this has been picked up on by my colleagues. Last month, I wound up missing our supervision for the month unexpectedly as my mother had fallen unconscious and needed help. I wasn't able to communicate this until the meeting had concluded. I apologised for my lack of attendance as soon as I was able, said it was due to a family emergency, and offered to communicate my important updates over message. I received a reply telling me that missing supervisions was becoming a bad habit of mine, that I often give a variety of reasons for this, and that, bluntly, it was not acceptable. I apologised in a diplomatic way, not wanting to rock the boat, and received no response. But this is simply not true. The last supervision I missed was in November 2022 at a point the meetings were biweekly, and it was due to a university engagement that also meant another one of my colleagues couldn't attend. \n\nToday we had another meeting. The topic shifted into ways I can make content more engaging for a child who struggles with motivation, and my boss asked my colleagues for their thoughts. I listened, thanked them for their ideas, and added some context essentially saying I've tried X approach before, will implement their ideas, and acknowledged that this child generally struggles with staying engaged so I'm keen to keep things fresh using a mix of tried and tested and newer ideas. My boss immediately intervened, saying she felt I wasn't engaging with or appreciating the contributions of my peers and that I was acting like I had resigned to the child's temperament and wasn't seeing it as a responsibility of my own. I apologised that my words had come across this way, thanked my colleagues again, and reiterated that I was just trying to give context I thought may be helpful. This was brushed off, I was told that we'd spent enough of the meeting talking about my updates, and we moved on. My colleagues immediately messaged me after the meeting in awe of what happened, that they didn't agree with what she'd said, and joked that she hates me. \n\nI feel a little damned if I do, damned if I don't - in hindsight, I think I should have been more concise and swift in acknowledging the ideas and not said anything else. However, I am hyperaware that I am not in good graces and find myself feeling the need to overcompensate by providing explanations and a lot of detail. I realise that I have just wound up digging myself a hole, where my desire to show eagerness is coming across more as defensiveness. \n\nI feel awkward broaching the topic of references knowing I have caught her at a time where she doesn't seem happy with me and I feel as though I can't do anything right. It's as though she's already made up her mind that I am flaky and I realise now my communication style isn't particularly compatible with her own. \n\nMy boss doesn't have any interaction with me during the rest of the month as I deliver my work and coordinate my own schedule independently, so I was considering using one of my colleagues as a reference to mitigate the potential that the reference won't be good.

I had mentioned it to her during my performance review today but idk if she actually took it seriously or not.

I recently just got off the phone with my manager and got a promotion with a 10% increase. I am very thrilled because I have been looking for a new role for more money and stability. We have been having layoffs but our company has been leveraging very well so I can still have a job with the company for maybe 3 or more years. I say this because I work in Finance and I literaly handle our numbers lol. Anyways, I wanted to negotiate the salary.

During those hours we can't give him any task cause he is busy according to my colleagues in HQ.\nAa a result I get an additional workload that I have to cover cause he didn't either do it due to unknown factors or cause he had those meetings. \n\nIssue#4\nIf CO needs to leave not for vacation or paid leave but due to personal needs they usually replace him with a random colleague of his. \nWell there are many things I could say about this replacement of his but saddly the time of service that guy offers is so little that we have to instruct him about how HQ works and it doesn't matter in the end cause the main guy is CO and would be back a few days later. \nTo make it short the other guy did not bring any equipment from his company thus fully focusing on what we tell him and committing to the tasks given. \nHe does his full time as expected cause he has a car and if I recall correctly lives in the area of CO. \nEven my colleagues in HQ agree he was better than the other guy.\n \n\nBesides the list presented above I can't refer to any of his traits as a person cause it's not affecting work performance and as a result not an issue that I have to deal with. \nColleagues from HQ agree with those points but do nothing about it and I am fed up. \nTheir supervisor is aware and yet hasnt asked for a change from the CO. \nThe last time I asked one colleague if it was possible to make a call for that matter I was told that it's rude from my side to support such act since we are not the ones  to control who they send. \nI get his point of view but I can't stand having the same paygrade as someone that works 2-3h less and has a lot lower performance than me. \n\nMy thought process is to talk directly to their supervisor again but it feels like betrayal to the people I work with given what I was told last time I asked. \nI could contact my company as well but what could they do?

When I come across posts regarding someone looking for a new job/complaining about their current one and looking for suggestions there will often be quite a few responses recommending the OP pick up a trade (regardless of the OP's background or goals).\n\nHowever, when the OP expresses no such interest in entering the trades, they are then either slammed as being lazy, entitled, afraid of hard work or told to be \"realistic\" implying that the trades are their only viable career options.

No need to demean the inquirer. Come up with another idea and actually listen to the OP instead of throwing the half-assed, rubber-stamp answer \"Dude, go pick up a trade!\" or just simply move on after giving free advice.\n\nThere's a good reason for the labor shortage. Its backbreaking, the pay is grossly exaggerated and its actually fairly complex work. Sure you'll always be in-demand but at an enormous cost to your health and well being. Its funny and disheartening to see posters gloat about getting $25-30 an hour as a tradesman.

My understanding of the differences between the two roles is that acting means the person that has the job is currently away.  There were two recent examples of this in my current company.  In one case, the permanent person took on an interim position higher up the chain.  So the person that replaced permanent person went into an acting role since the permanent person was not really gone.\n\nThe other case involved a person that was about to get fired.  While my company worked out (legal) details of letting that person go, they put an acting person in place.  So in both cases the person with the job was not technically gone, which it what I generally see when there in a interim person.  In those cases, the permanent person is gone gone.\n\nPerhaps I am not completely understanding the two designations, but sitting here romanticizing the possibility of getting the job has me wondering at every angle.

I (28F) have been applying for jobs since the start of 2024. I've been at my current job almost 2 years, and though I enjoy it, I'd been wanting to leave for a few reasons: 1) general fatigue and burnout, 2) a long commute and 3) wanting to make a higher salary. My commute was initially fine but got a lot longer after I moved to the suburbs to live with my partner. Let's call him Jack.\n\nA few days ago, I had a third interview with a company I really like. They called me the next day to say they reached out to my references. I know my references are still submitting materials, but I am hoping to have a response soon. When I first started applying, I told myself I'd accept the job if I got an offer, as long as it was higher than my current salary.\n\nWell, fast forward a couple days. Jack and I broke up. We'd been having some issues but I still didn't expect things to go the way they did, when they did. I am now staying at a friend's place, and hoping to move somewhere more stable soon. I'm safe but heartbroken and sad and mentally drained. I loved Jack (still do) and it was my longest relationship and first time living with an SO.\n\nIn light of my breakup, I've been having second thoughts about this potential new job. My current boss has been very supportive and kind throughout my situation, though he does not know about the interviews. Work has also slowed down for a bit. I am now living closer to the office and plan to get a place within a 30-ish minute drive from work. Also, switching jobs would mean switching insurance, and that feels tricky given some physical & mental health stuff I need to take care of. \n\nAlong with all that, I don't know if I have the mental energy to start a whole new job and leave my current one. I know healing takes time, and things will get better, but I really don't know how long this transition will take.\n\nWould it be wrong to decline the job offer if I got one? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Would appreciate your insights.

My understanding of the differences between the two roles is that acting means the person that has the job is currently away.  There were two recent examples of this in my current company.  In one case, the permanent person took on an interim position higher up the chain.  So the person that replaced permanent person went into an acting role since the permanent person was not really gone.\n\nThe other case involved a person that was about to get fired.  While my company worked out (legal) details of letting that person go, they put an acting person in place.  So in both cases the person with the job was not technically gone, which it what I generally see when there in a interim person.  In those cases, the permanent person is gone gone.\n\nPerhaps I am not completely understanding the two designations, but sitting here romanticizing the possibility of getting the job has me wondering at every angle.

However, before I\u2019d even started the company had to cut back on hiring, and I was essentially ghosted and never ended up working there. I\u2019ve been trying to get into a field linked to my degree (history/heritage), but I\u2019m always on the last round of interviews and then never hired. That lasted almost seven months, during which I started volunteering and undertaking a business diploma online to get qualified, remain busy, and keep my options open.\n\nToday, the charity with which I\u2019ve been volunteering at offered me a job and I accepted, and I was elated to finally have some security back in my life. It\u2019s another retail role but this time in a bookshop, which is more in alignment with my longer term goals of getting into heritage publishing. It also pays better than my last job, with a pension scheme and full time contract. Needless to say, I was so excited to finally take some steps forward.\n\nI just broke the news to my Dad, and he replied with a very sarcastic, disinterested \u201cthank god for that. Not like it\u2019s hard to get into retail\u201d, and just walked away. I\u2019m trying to see his point of view with compassion, as I know it\u2019s not easy having your adult child live with you while they\u2019re unemployed, and I know he just wants the best for me and wants me to get another job in my dream field. But considering my experiences over the last few months, I just kind of needed a bit more enthusiasm you know. This new job will give me income, a chance to start a pension, and allow me funds to either save for an MA degree or rent a room elsewhere closer to where the jobs in my field is (most of my rejections came from the fact I was too far from the workplace or that I didn\u2019t drive. I drive now, but I\u2019m still a firm believer in going where the work is).\n\nNot sure if this was a rant or a cry for help lol, but it really dampened what should have been a relieving moment for me, and now I feel almost ashamed to have been so excited over a retail job even though I know how valid and demanding this industry is. I know my situation has probably had its impact on him emotionally as well, but I just expected more excitement or support from him after having been through so much rejection and frustration these last few months.

I (28F) have been applying for jobs since the start of 2024. I've been at my current job almost 2 years, and though I enjoy it, I'd been wanting to leave for a few reasons: 1) general fatigue and burnout, 2) a long commute and 3) wanting to make a higher salary. My commute was initially fine but got a lot longer after I moved to the suburbs to live with my partner. Let's call him Jack.\n\nA few days ago, I had a third interview with a company I really like. They called me the next day to say they reached out to my references. I know my references are still submitting materials, but I am hoping to have a response soon. When I first started applying, I told myself I'd accept the job if I got an offer, as long as it was higher than my current salary.\n\nWell, fast forward a couple days. Jack and I broke up. We'd been having some issues but I still didn't expect things to go the way they did, when they did. I am now staying at a friend's place, and hoping to move somewhere more stable soon. I'm safe but heartbroken and sad and mentally drained. I loved Jack (still do) and it was my longest relationship and first time living with an SO.\n\nIn light of my breakup, I've been having second thoughts about this potential new job. My current boss has been very supportive and kind throughout my situation, though he does not know about the interviews. Work has also slowed down for a bit. I am now living closer to the office and plan to get a place within a 30-ish minute drive from work. Also, switching jobs would mean switching insurance, and that feels tricky given some physical & mental health stuff I need to take care of. \n\nAlong with all that, I don't know if I have the mental energy to start a whole new job and leave my current one. I know healing takes time, and things will get better, but I really don't know how long this transition will take.\n\nWould it be wrong to decline the job offer if I got one? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Would appreciate your insights.

My understanding of the differences between the two roles is that acting means the person that has the job is currently away.  There were two recent examples of this in my current company.  In one case, the permanent person took on an interim position higher up the chain.  So the person that replaced permanent person went into an acting role since the permanent person was not really gone.\n\nThe other case involved a person that was about to get fired.  While my company worked out (legal) details of letting that person go, they put an acting person in place.  So in both cases the person with the job was not technically gone, which it what I generally see when there in a interim person.  In those cases, the permanent person is gone gone.\n\nPerhaps I am not completely understanding the two designations, but sitting here romanticizing the possibility of getting the job has me wondering at every angle.
