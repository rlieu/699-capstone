I am a MSc Finance student in the Netherlands, and I am orienting myself on the world of work after graduation. I have attended many events by various companies. It has come to my attention that quite a lot of work in the Finance industry exceeds 40 hours. Often, you get a theoretical contract for 40 hours, but in practice, you end up working 50 or more regularly because of unpaid overwork. In Private Equity (PE) and Investment Banking (IB), work weeks are far longer and there everything from 60 up to 80 is considered normal. Even in Consultancy, there are loads of firms that work more than 40 hours.\\n\\nAt least where I live, we are accustomed to the standard 40 hour work week. This holds in a lot of sectors, such as construction, healthcare, transportation, et cetera. However, this clearly does not hold in the Finance industry. When I talk about this with Finance-people, they say that they are okay with more than 40 hours. However, when I talk with non-Finance people, they say that 60 is already far too much and they prefer 36-hour work weeks or even shorter if this is possible for them financially.\\n\\nI was wondering whether others recognize this difference as well, and why are the people working in Finance different from the average person, which results in them being okay with this? Can you still succeed in Finance if you do not wish to work 60+ hours per week?

My current company is freezing me out of the sales process even though sales specialist is literally in my job title. They are incompetent at best, and ignoring regulations at worst. I need to get out but I haven't been able to find jobs in my direct field and I don't really know where to go next. Help?\\n\\n\\n\\nI've worked in finance for about 6 years, mostly in life insurance wholesaling. I spent one year working for a financial advisor with his of being one of his successors. His long-time sales assistant ended up making my life a living hell because I picked up her slack on a few projects and she thought I was stealing her job. She was more valuable than I was since she knew all of his client's information like a computer... But has never been on time with anything. The advisor and branch manager were not willing to help me in the situation at all because they were blatantly trying to keep her happy and I felt like an outcast. \\n\\nWhen I left, I found a life insurance position with a startup fintech company that is focused on building an illustration platform and bringing in high net worth cases and I am the technical sales and product specialist. This is a small company and I am the only one with experience in life wholesaling and product design so I have the most background knowledge in case design and other considerations. When I first took this job, the description of this role was everything I was looking for. I was told that internally I would be building their entire knowledge base of product & managing all of their relationships with the carriers. On the sales side, I was told that I would be traveling with the CEO and CIO to meet with prospective clients and agencies to bring on and also going to conferences around the country to meet carriers face to face. \\n\\nNothing about my role is what I was told. First, there is no travel at all and I've been shot down every time I mention a conference going on. Second, and most importantly, I have absolutely no involvement in the sales process and have little to no information on any of the cases that get sent to me. Third, I barely have any time to fill in my whole database because of the fact that they have me running hundreds of illustrations all the time. Not because there are that many cases, but just because they have no idea what they're actually looking for or they send me the wrong information which happens often. All of my time is spent running illustrations with basically no information on the clients or what they're really looking for so mistakes happen often and most of them could've been avoided.\\n\\nFrom a sales point of view, I know that things would be easier and much smoother if I was able to even sit in and listen on these client calls and presentations because that would give me a better idea of how to structure things. I also know that I would be able to explain these products in a way that would make sense to these high net worth clients and advisors that haven't used life insurance in their portfolios. Another important thing to note is that I'm not getting paid commission on anything when I've been told from another wholesaler friend that with cases like this, I should be making almost double what I am. \\n\\nI was planning on talking to my boss (CIO) about this in person last week. That idea got thrown out the window because of our biggest case. I've been working on the design for this case for months and only going off of what options they think would work best. Each set is about 50+ illustrations and takes a while to configure. Because this case is so large, I reached out to an industry friend that told me all of the things that need to be considered besides case design in an estate planning structure. The day before I was supposed to go into the office, I asked my \\\"director of operations\\\" if I could see the cover letter that would get sent in with full applications because I said that would help me have some more information on the case. At this point I also didn't even know that they were sending in full applications but it is what it is. Not even 5 minutes after I asked, I got a call from my boss and he basically told me that I don't need to know anything and that too many people were already working on this case. I even told him that I frequently have wholesalers from other carriers ask me about applications or cases that we have in underwriting and every time I have to tell them that I don't know anything. It gets awkward being in the position that I'm supposed to be in. My boss didn't care, he just told me to tell them that he's handling it. \\n\\nI knew that they didn't really want to share information with me and now it is blatantly obvious that I'm not supposed to know anything at this point. I also know that things are not being done correctly and it could hurt the clients and also hurt this company in the long run. No one wants to listen.\\n\\nLast thing I'll add is the fact that they have many individuals that are not qualified to have the kind of titles they have and they're not licensed to do some of the things they're doing. The \\\"director of operations\\\" has never worked with life insurance and doesn't even know how to fill in applications correctly. She even got information wrong on the biggest case. Our Chief Revenue Officer has no experience in sales or insurance and has no licenses (he's from out of the country and I don't even think he could get licensed to have the conversations he's having). Our CEO was a life insurance producer but doesn't know anything abount product design and can barely remember what he's even asked for. Our CIO has only ever worked in hedge funds and has no idea how to handle large cases or advanced planning. Also, they are definitely not doing things by regulation on multiple fronts and I can get into that if needed.  \\n\\n\\nSorry for the long rant, I've just known for a while that I need to get out. I've been trying to apply to other life insurance wholesaling type roles and it really just seems that there isn't really much out there and a lot of these companies would probably think I don't have the kind of experience that they would want to see even though I'm doing more than I would at any single carrier. I feel like I'm at a point where I should consider leaving finance together because all I really had in this field is a string of terrible bosses or working situations. I don't know where to go or what to do next and I guess I'm just looking for some advice. I'm 31, so a career shift wouldn't be terrible at this point in my life.

To pull good comps, the companies need to be in the same industry and the question states that this small business has no clearly defined industry. \\n\\nI thought about also saying that instead of looking for companies by industry I could search by business function (basically the same thing as industry so you can see why I'm having a hard time going down this route), size, and geography. \\n\\nMaybe doing a DCF and unlevering/levering betas to assess CAPM and a WACC could be another answer, but I would have to use comparable companies to get those beta figures. \\n\\nDoes anyone have an idea of how to answer this question?  \"", "title": "How to value a small business with no clearly defined industry - Interview Question (IB Analyst)", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1bgdmgz/how_to_value_a_small_business_with_no_clearly/"}, {"author": "BrownBoyJaws", "created_utc": 1710612955.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 2, "post_id": "1bgce2h", "score": 2, "subreddit": "FinancialCareers", "text": "\"I\\u2019m currently 2 years into Big4 audit in the bay area but I want to pivot into a financial analyst position (better hours, more interesting work for me).

I would really like your guidance, because I feel lost on my next steps. Below I will give a history of my work experience for you to get an idea of my background, and then afterwards I\\u2019ll tell you what I\\u2019m thinking and would appreciate your feedback. \\n\\n(1) I completed a summer internship at Bank of America - but it was an exclusive rotational internship across four divisions (Finance, Operations, Technology, and Global Information Security), so I didn\\u2019t get any extensive experience in a particular department. I gained exposure to the investment banking industry first via this internship, but the lack of front-office exposure makes it hard to leverage, as I\\u2019m not targeting roles in the divisions I rotated in. \\n\\n(2) The next summer, I started a summer internship in Commercial Finance at a policy advisory, which was extended so that I now have 9 months of internship experience in banking policy advisory and advocacy at this company, which recently ended for me. I also rotated in four policy teams on this internship (Commercial Finance, Mortgages, Cards and Consumer Credit, Personal Banking). I worked on many important initiatives that would shape the future of financial services in the UK, helped draft consultation responses, liaising directly with CEOs of building societies/small banks to secure funding, helped manage committees, and did regulation research. I thoroughly enjoyed this role but they don\\u2019t have a permanent role available. \\n\\nMy extracurriculars are: Research Fellow from a think tank (3 months), trading analyst positions at LSE society, and another subcommittee position involving event organisation. \\n\\nI\\u2019m not sure where to go next. Most companies have closed their application for graduate schemes, so I have to wait until winter time to apply again. \\n\\nI come from a working class background (household income from mother\\u2019s job in Tesco) so pursuing an elite Master\\u2019s (which cost upwards of \\u00a330,000 plus accommodation) is economically impossible for me. Plus, I graduated with a 66 average with only two first class marks, leaving me doubtful my grades are on the right tier, and also whether I\\u2019d be able to secure a scholarship even if I was admitted. \\n\\nThe government does however give loans for around \\u00a312,000 for Masters degrees. Accordingly, I have identified economically viable options I could pursue. For example, SOAS University of London has a MSc in Finance that would cost around \\u00a315,000 in tuition fees, which is achievable for me with the government loan and personal savings. This way, I could also open the door for myself for roles that require financial knowledge or finance degrees, although it isn\\u2019t from a university perceived as elite. Do you think that because I went to LSE for my Bachelor\\u2019s, this would be an okay option? What do you think of this route?\\n\\nI\\u2019m personally unclear on what I want to do, and this may be reflected through the rotational nature of my internships in banking and policy advisory and also the BofA summer internship. \\n\\nI would really appreciate your guidance.

But I was told they don\\u2019t need to and there is no incentive to find a needle in a stack when you have piles of resumes coming out from the Ivies on your desk on a constant basis. \\n\\n-The chore of the job is to work long hours and work on sales project. Therefore they need a metric that can convince them(and the persons they want to pitch/sell something) that you can handle the work. So it ends up being the name of the school and few other things in between. \\n\\nAt the time, these arguments were making sense to me. \\n\\nBut each week on this sub, I will see a recruiter that will come and vent about the quality of candidates and how they end up wasting time not finding any suitable kid for their open positions( how they don\\u2019t know what IB is, how they don\\u2019t want to do grunt work, how they feel entitled, how their grades don\\u2019t translate in their work etc.) \\n\\nAt this point, I think people in IB are just enjoying the status quo.

Ironically when the resister offered this solution to the recruiter, the recruiter got defensive and she said she doesn\\u2019t want to deter other applicants from applying.) \\n\\nAlso I read many times that IB were losing potential candidates to other industries like tech for example( which is ironic because tech recruiters are not fame/target schools hunters unlike IB). \\n\\nThese are just my 2 cents on the matter.

I didn\\u2019t really do a lot of research and just knew I wanted to be an analyst. I saw my university\\u2019s IB club was accepting applications and researched the topic. After reading a 120 page career guide I realized IB is not for me. I did not think I could handle the 80-100 hour work weeks. For the rest of college, I felt inferior because I wasn\\u2019t pursuing something aggressive like IB. I felt like I didn\\u2019t have a purpose and a concrete goal.\\n\\nI just graduated in December with my Bachelor's degree in finance. I did an internship for a large manufacturing company last summer for their FLDP but did not get an offer (only 4/11 of the people I interned with got offers). The company was tied closely with interest rates which made sense why they hired so few people. I was in the channel finance sector and had a tough manager and a tough project trying to code in Apps Script (I never took a coding class, ever). Getting yelled at by the boss didn\\u2019t help either, and working until 1am one night to work on advanced coding when I had never done it was practically impossible for me. It really negatively affected my self esteem. Multiple people at the company said the project was not for an intern and my own manager said I wouldn\\u2019t finish it by the end of the summer. I kept my college job I had before that provided some scholarship money (and time and a half on Sundays) so I was good for then - but I didn\\u2019t look for jobs for two months due to fearing rejection. After that rejection and finally applying in late October I ended up getting an FLDP offer at a local manufacturing company - 17 days after applying - through an alumni I messaged and did a networking call with on LinkedIn. The job is in the same college town I live in. I am currently a Treasury Analyst, which I really like. I am still living with my parents at age 21 (always have other than my summer internship) and I have been saving money. Today I hit $20k in investments and $50k in cash, my goal is to stick around at home until age 25 and have $250k in cash to put towards a house and around $50k in investments.  \\n\\n\\nCollege was not the best time for me. I started on the right foot but completely wasted my time there. I started out with 68 college credits I did at a local community college in high school and was runner up for valedictorian in high school. I went to college on a full merit scholarship covering over $38,000 of tuition. I had massive self esteem issues due to how harsh people treated me there and had barely any friends in high school. I never went to a homecoming or prom. In high school I figured out accounting basics and took 4 classes. A friend at the time his dad was a CFA so I was able to learn some things from him. \\n\\n\\nI did a shit job in college. Went to a non-target but state flagship. Graduated with a 3.3. Dealt with multiple family moves, car accidents, a workers comp claim, tore both of my supraspinatus in my back, chronic sinus infections, getting covid, feeling suicidal, having no organization and constantly dealt with anxiety. This was all over a 2.5 year period. I used Chegg multiple exams and I feel like I didn\\u2019t learn a lot in college. I didn\\u2019t really study either. Should I go back and relearn material at this point? I considered applying for our schools investment banking program freshman year but realized after reading the 120 page career guide I wouldn\\u2019t be able to be elite in a field where you work 80-100 hours a week and aren\\u2019t in love with the job. From that point on I was insecure because I wasn\\u2019t the \\u201cbest\\u201d anymore like I was in high school.\\n\\n\\nI hired a therapist and did 5 sessions with her before quitting. She said I have generalized anxiety disorder but after our sessions I felt worse because she gave me no timeline and wasn\\u2019t very helpful overall. She also said I am very mean to myself and am hard on myself. I have decided to figure this out on my own at this point because I am tired of leaving work early to go see a therapist and talk about my problems with no results. How do I improve my self esteem and not show it as being poor at work? My current manager said I am doing fine overall but I could be better about deadlines and attention to detail but he is not worried as he is still training me on processes and I had been there for less than two months. \\n\\n\\nI am trying to reach a sense of closure with college. Many of my friends were very involved socially (I was a commuter who lived 20 miles away) and many of my friends went into IB. I was always comparing myself to others and I am really embarrassed to say I pissed away college. I never felt a sense of purpose in college, and as a man that is so incredibly important. Never went out on weekends either. I still got out of college with my bachelors at age 20, no debt, and an $83k/yr salary. By society\\u2019s standards I am doing great but I feel like the opposite. I like my job at the manufacturing FLDP, I have a great manager, and our company is doing very well right now. I feel like if I don\\u2019t plan my career out now I am setting myself up for failure. I feel so stupid doing/saying all of this stuff. I just turned 21 so it's not too late, but I am really feeling lost right now and don\\u2019t know where to start.

I love to find interesting stories of day to day things, places etc. I love being imaginative and creative and finding new and creative ways of doing things.\\n\\nI don't like chemistry at all. I am okay with Maths and Physics. I am absolutely fascinated by software specifically designing and how it works.\\n\\nI don't like jobs that involve sales or any related sales target and don't wish to pursue any trades.\\n\\nFollowing are the degrees/fields I have researched on and my genuine feedbacks - ( I have researched online, talked with students and current employees in the field)\\n\\nCounseling/Therapist - Love this field and career. I would have to do 4yrs of UG and then gain some experience to get into 2yr Masters and then certification. It will atleast take 6-7 yrs. Cannot devote that much time \\n\\nTeaching - Always wanted to be a teacher but the current situation of education system in Canada and how teachers are being treated in Canada. I would love to prevent it unless something drastic happens to make situation better for teaching in this country.\\n\\nSoftware Engineering - Most balanced and safe bet. Technology Job market is rough right now so that scares me a bit. But still it is in one of top spots in all of my options.\\n\\nFainance/ Management/ HR - I am in RBC and I don't like being on phone all day but if I have to do something in banking I know would prefer going in risk management/complaince, HR , training and development.\\n\\nPublic Administration Uottawa - Another degree I have been very fascinated by after researching with college, past graduates. Co-op option and a highly employable program to get into government job. Most students have positive reviews about the program and co-op is actually very solid as well.\\n\\nCivil Engineering Technology - 32 month diploma at RRC that is really well recognized around in the province. Co-op and highly respected by employers anx past graduates. Very Math heavy ( which scares me a bit) but a really great program.\\n\\nApplication Delivery and Development - 28 month (4 terms plus 1 co-op term) at RRC. Another good program with positive reviews from graduates. This program can be a great stepping stone to go into tech field but it usually is well recognized in Winnipeg but is really hard to get jobs with it outside province anx tech market is really bad and I have been advised to go for a degree with co-op rather than diploma to increased my chances. \\n\\nI have been trying to narrow down and it's been really hard.

I am a 21-year-old male who graduated with a degree in Finance and a minor in Macroeconomics in May of 2023. Allow me to provide some context about my background and experiences.\\n\\nMy journey into finance and investing began during my senior year of high school when I started with Penny Trading and later progressed to learning about Options. While I am still a retail trader and lack experience managing an options book, I am familiar with Greeks. I also delved into reading 10Ks and 10Qs and managing my own portfolio, which saw success, particularly due to me being long with Puts in early Jan of 2020 before the COVID meltdown. This experience solidified my passion for finance, particularly in macroeconomics.\\n\\nIn June 2022, I interned in IRS derivatives, which allowed me hands-on experience with derivatives and macroeconomics. Despite enjoying the role and the learning opportunities it provided, I did not receive a return offer due to my location preferences, a decision I now realize I should have been more open-minded about.\\n\\nFrom August 2022 to May 2023, I tirelessly applied to market-related roles, making it to final round interviews for a proprietary trading firm. Unfortunately, they decided not to hire anyone due to economic uncertainties at the time.\\n\\nCurrently, I work in operations for an Asset Administration firm. While the company and my team are fantastic, I feel I am not growing in the areas I am passionate about, such as macroeconomics, fixed income, investing, and trading.\\n\\nMy dream job would be in trading or market making, but I lack the technical skills for computer science roles. I thrive on learning on the job, but breaking into these fields has proven challenging. I have considered pursuing a Masters in Finance alongside an MBA to broaden my opportunities, but I am uncertain if my current role as an Admin Agent would be sufficient to gain admission to top programs.\\n\\nUltimately, my goal is to immerse myself in equity research, fixed income research, trading, or similar roles to expand my knowledge of financial markets and investing. I have even explored the idea of buying a small business with the intention of gaining entrepreneurial experience and eventually transitioning into private equity.\\n\\nAt this juncture, I feel I am not learning enough and am somewhat adrift in my career aspirations.\\n\\nI will attach my resume for reference.

While some individuals may still prefer the tangible feel of a physical planner, the benefits of using a digital planner are undeniable. Here's why making the switch to a digital planner can offer a more efficient and streamlined planning experience.\\n\\n### 1. Accessibility and Synchronization:\\n\\nOne of the primary advantages of a digital planner is its accessibility. Digital planners can be accessed from various devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, providing users with the flexibility to plan on the go. Additionally, cloud-based synchronization ensures that your planner is always up-to-date across all devices, eliminating the risk of losing or forgetting important information.\\n\\n### 2. Real-Time Updates and Notifications:\\n\\nDigital planners allow for real-time updates and notifications. Set reminders for appointments, deadlines, or tasks, and receive timely alerts to keep you on track. This feature minimizes the risk of overlooking crucial events and enhances overall time management.\\n\\n### 3. Customization and Flexibility:\\n\\nDigital planners offer a level of customization and flexibility that paper planners struggle to match. With a variety of templates, color schemes, and design options, users can tailor their digital planners to suit their preferences. Changes can be made easily without the need for erasers or whiteout.\\n\\n### 4. Eco-Friendly and Paperless:\\n\\nIn an era where environmental consciousness is paramount, opting for a digital planner aligns with eco-friendly practices. By going paperless, users contribute to reducing their carbon footprint, eliminating the need for physical materials and reducing waste.\\n\\n### 5. Search and Organization:\\n\\nLocating specific information in a digital planner is a breeze. Search functionalities enable users to find entries quickly, making it an efficient tool for professionals managing extensive schedules or those with a high volume of information to organize.\\n\\n### 6. Collaborative Features:\\n\\nFor team projects or family planning, digital planners provide collaborative features that are absent in traditional paper planners. Shared calendars, task lists, and updates ensure seamless coordination among individuals, enhancing overall productivity.\\n\\n### 7. Backup and Security:\\n\\nDigital planners offer the convenience of automatic backups. In the event of device loss or malfunction, your data remains secure and can be easily recovered. Password protection and encryption features add an extra layer of security to your sensitive information.\\n\\n### 8. Cost-Effective in the Long Run:\\n\\nWhile digital planners may require an initial investment in technology, they prove cost-effective in the long run. Eliminating the need for physical planners, stationery, and other supplies results in savings over time.\\n\\n**9. planner recommendation:** \\n\\n[https://www.etsy.com/listing/1690036893/undated-goodnotes-planner-monthly?click\\\\_key=33434c4c9d6afd1e5c238367d24bace3cacff511%3A1690036893&click\\\\_sum=9252b181&ref=shop\\\\_home\\\\_active\\\\_2&pro=1](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1690036893/undated-goodnotes-planner-monthly?click_key=33434c4c9d6afd1e5c238367d24bace3cacff511%3A1690036893&click_sum=9252b181&ref=shop_home_active_2&pro=1)\\n\\nIn conclusion, the advantages of using a digital planner extend beyond convenience\\u2014they cater to the demands of a modern lifestyle.

I'm 23, 1 year out of school. I work at a Large Bank in NYC doing Investment Services- Internal Audit. This is absolutely not what I wanted to be doing out of college but it was my fallback plan and ended up being the only offer I had out of college. \\n\\nNow let's rewind to get some perspective.\\n\\nI've always wanted to go into Banking specifically IB I learned what they do in high school from a fiance course and was sold. I don't come from a place of wealth or people in the industry so during my beginning years of college I never really knew the immediate action that I needed to take to get my foot in the door. I didn't even know what a target school was until I was a sophomore in college, and not being a target school they never talked about IB, they always pushed accounting or corporate finance positions. My first semester back from Covid, Junior year I was applying to multiple IB internships every day, and had some interviews but there was no luck, by this point I felt like it was too late. I know firms take kids young and usually will hire their interns full-time. Nevertheless, I ended up taking an asset management Internship for the summer in hopes Firms would see my transferable skills when applying for full-time roles.\\n\\nThis was not the case.\\n\\nI knew I was behind in the race so, over the summer I took Excel courses, learned methodology, and improved my industry knowledge. After wrapping up my internship in August, I was starting to apply to 10+ jobs a day. I kept this up for 7-8 months. And there was no luck. I honestly was extremely depressed for a long time. I felt like my goals were passing by and no matter how hard I tried I wasn't getting in. So, I thought if I can't get into an IB role I might as well try to get into a Bank in any role. This is how I ended up in an internal audit, which I can't stand I'm way too overqualified for this lol.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI'm not sure what to do now. Do I continue to Pursue IB,  or do I pursue something else and if so what roles would you recommend? Really been so programmed on IB that I haven't looked much elsewhere.

I just started my first job as a budget analyst working at a large non profit. I need critical advice because there are some serious problems here. I have two bosses. One is the executive director at my site and the second is the VP of finance at the national level. I get along with my VP but my ED is a terrible boss and is making my life miserable. She threw a fit after i told her we aren\\u2019t allowed to record overtime to a grant because it\\u2019s unallowable via the terms of the grant contract. (It was $50 of overtime\\u2026.) -_-\\n\\nThe previous budget analyst told me she had to leave for her mental health. The previous operations manager was fired and is suing the company now. \\n\\nLet me know if I should leave this company based on what you read below. Here are a list of things that are wrong with this site.\\n\\n1. The executive director is asking me to do things that are unethical like leaving my national team in the dark about certain topics. \\n\\n2. Without the ability to openly communicate with my national team it\\u2019s impossible for me to receive the necessary training I need to succeed in the BA role.\\n\\n3. Several employees have privately informed me that the ED is firing the employees who report to National. \\n\\n4. I believe National is already aware of this and chooses to turn a blind eye so no corrective actions are being enforced.\\n\\n5. We have salary\\u2019s being coded to expired fund codes and it\\u2019s difficult to correct on the front end since the HR Manager is a personal friend of the executive director  and is hesitant to make changes in payroll without the ED\\u2019s approval.\\n\\n6. The program assistant who oversees all the receipts/invoices at this location is also a personal friend of the executive director and is reluctant to include the BA in the reviewal process. (I\\u2019ve requested to be included and was met with resistance)\\n\\n7. The executive director is asking me to solve her deficit but without the ability for the BA to correct processes on the front end it\\u2019s difficult for any impactful changes to occur moving forward in time. (Reallocate salaries, change pr codes, approve requests from coordinators)\\n\\n8. The salary allocation chart is outdated and it\\u2019s difficult to make adjustments without knowing where employees are truly being allocated. \\n\\n9. Budgets are being renewed without the proper detail necessary. Grants are being copied and pasted over from the previous year without any real thought process going into individual line items.\\n\\n10. Employees are being allocated into grants which don\\u2019t really allow the amount of FTEs being allocated to them. (2 employees being recorded to a grant that only allows 1)\\n\\n11. Employees are being carelessly allocated into vacant positions which they aren\\u2019t really performing the role of. (An employee being allocated 25% to a role even if they aren\\u2019t really covering the role.\\n\\n12.

As an international student, my options seem diverse yet daunting, with considerations spanning from pursuing further education to diving into the job market amidst visa complexities. Here's a detailed account of my predicament, where I'm keen to absorb wisdom from this community's seasoned professionals.\\n\\n**Dilemmas and Considerations:**\\n\\n1. **Postgraduate Studies vs. Work Experience:** I'm torn between applying for a Master's in Finance, attempting the CFA Level 1, and seeking internships under a Graduate Visa. The balance between further academic qualifications and practical experience is a thin line to walk.\\n2. **Visa Concerns:** The tightening of Skilled Worker Visa requirements in the UK leaves me questioning the feasibility of securing sponsorship, particularly for entry-level roles which are crucial stepping stones for someone in my position. I am not sure someone will be happy to a) hire me b) hire me for \\u00a338k+ c) sponsor my visa.\\n3. **Career Direction:** My passion lies in Real Estate Investments. I even advanced to the final interview with Savills but was ultimately rejected. I suspect visa constraints or possibly inclusivity factors played a role (I am a white straight male) . This has led me to reconsider the value of a specialised Master's degree versus a broader Master's in Finance, given the industry's nuances.\\n4. **Academic Performance:** Personal challenges have impacted my studies, and I anticipate graduating with a 2.2 (2.1 if I am very lucky). This outcome, while not reflective of my capabilities, adds another layer of complexity to my job search efforts.\\n5. **Skillset and Transferability:** My exposure to Economics has not seamlessly translated into employable skills for finance roles. Each interview requires substantial preparation from the ground up, highlighting a gap between my education and the practical demands of finance.\\n6. **Employability and Job Applications:** Despite meticulous applications (150+ in second and 120+ in third year, and not just the Easy Apply's), the response rate has been disheartening. This situation has intensified my concerns about my attractiveness as a candidate in the finance sector.\\n7. **Personal and Financial Independence:** At 24, the desire to leave my parents' support structure and achieve financial independence is strong, although my family is well off and my family is open to any decision I make. Yet, the prospect of investing in an uncertain educational path without guaranteed returns is daunting.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0cuqxinmv5nc1.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=910b72fef3eafd9fb9d146a892a9e7ed07dd0923\\n\\n**Request for Advice:**Given these multifaceted concerns, I'm reaching out to this community for guidance on how best to navigate these challenges.

I really love real estate and I want to be a commercial real estate investor at some point. So my degree path is a B.B.A in real estate which focuses on the comercial side. Obviously I would need a pretty sizable amount of capital to make that my full time job. Right now I\\u2019m working as a life insurance agent. The job is alright, I feel like I\\u2019m helping these people who don\\u2019t know how to manage their money very well because they will most likely not have enough money saved up to cover their final expenses. The problem is I ran some numbers on some of the policies, I know it\\u2019s a business so I know the company is doing this for profit, but if they just invested that money they\\u2019re paying for these policies the pay out would be a lot higher. I like investing a lot and I\\u2019m pretty sure I have a better understanding of investing than the average population and I\\u2019m only 23. Basically I realized I could help people more if I convinced them to invest their money rather then convincing them to buy life insurance, of course the purpose of insurance isn\\u2019t to invest your money it\\u2019s an insurance for risk so their is a place for it and it\\u2019s not morally appalling.

I think I can greatly broaden my horizons by exposing myself to a new organization. (This is also 100% true, I am really excited to shake things up)\\n\\n2. How many outstanding applications should I have for one company at one time? Surely at a certain point it's a red flag if I apply to like 10 jobs in the span of a few days right? Like it'll look like I'm just mindlessly spamming them? \\n\\n3.  Assuming I do apply to multiple jobs at one company, how much if at all should I change up my resume/cover letter? I was worried if I change it too much it'll look like I'm just changing my resume to match whatever I think they wanna hear, and not sharing my honestly skills/experience?

Online would be ideal, as I\\u2019d be able to continue living at home and save on costs, but at the same time I recognize that there\\u2019s probably a ton of networking with colleagues and professors that occurs.

I\\u2019ve dealt with a lot of \\u201creal world\\u201d numbers, especially during the startup, the small business, and the accounting job. I feel pretty comfortable in that regard, but I don\\u2019t know if this is enough. It might even be rudimentary compared to some of the more advanced things one would learn in a classroom setting. Should I compensate by taking the GRE? (A lot of the programs I\\u2019m looking at don\\u2019t require it so I wasn\\u2019t planning on taking it if possible).\\n3.

I'll give a bit of context and hopefully get some of your opinions.\\n\\nI started out of college \\\\~10 years ago with a degree in economics (loved it) and worked basically as an seller/underwriter/servicer of federal loans and grants. I gained a lot of exposure to the client side of finance, and I gained good tools related to credit analysis, underwriting, basic financial analysis, etc. During my time there, I went back to school and got an associates in accounting and my CPA.\\n\\nAfter a handful of years - as an angsty twenty-something - I moved out of state and got a job as a Financial Analyst at a small private civil engineering firm. It was incredibly unstructured and isolated. Isolated meaning that I was the only person in my position and had no real resource to go to for help, advice, a sounding board, etc. What I did like however, was working with SQL in searching for and scrubbing data, and preparing reports and presentations based on conclusions I had drawn independently. Ultimately I left because the management was toxic and destroying my mental health.\\n\\nI'm currently at a large(ish) private manufacturer as a Sr. Consolidation Analyst, which is a fancy way of saying I take all of our 14 plants' ledgers/financials and make it look nice for the C-suite to look through. I spend a lot of time identifying intercompany issues and letting the accountants at each plant know of errors to be fixed in their ledgers or revisions/moves to be made, etc. It's definitely more of an accounting-centric role, which I'm not a huge fan of. I also have heavy involvement in the budget/forecast process. The work is just dull and repetitive and though I'm absolutely growing as a well-rounded finance/accounting person, I feel a bit constricted. Anyway, I'm on the precipice of leaving because my wife and I would like to start a family, and we've decided to move back home to be closer to a support system.\\n\\nThe point of all this is simply that I don't know what positions or position titles I should be searching for as I start to look for new opportunities. I've worked my way up the ladder a bit, I supervise someone, I have \\\"senior\\\" in my name - so Financial Analyst would seem to be a step backwards right? Or at least at face value it would sound like it. But I'm certainly underqualified to be called something like Director. Does anyone have somewhat similar experiences in a career move and this point in a career?\\n\\nHopefully this was somewhat more useful than directionless word vomit.

We've had 2 interviews now, and the first one gave really big pyramid scheme vibes, but the second one makes it seem slightly more legit, but I still have reservations. I'm a SAHM after moving to a new area that didn't have any daycare openings, and we are doing fine on just my husband's income, but I like having a job and a part-time remote work opportunity is very appealing. However, I want to stay away from MLMs at all costs. I asked a lot of questions to try and figure out what the business model looks like without asking outright whether it's a pyramid scheme or not. Some of the main takeaways:\\n\\n\\u2022 This firm helps clients meet whatever financial goals they have in mind, whether it is finding the best insurance rates, starting a retirement plan, getting out of debt, buying a house, investing, and probably other things. \\n\\n\\u2022 In the first interview, he showed a PowerPoint presentation that had a photo illustrating different companies they have partnerships with that the financial advisors work with to help the clients meet their goals. I didn't recognize almost any of the companies besides Vivint, Voya, and Rocket Mortgage. \\n\\n\\u2022 Income comes from the companies you set clients up with; the clients don't pay a dime for the services. The company gives the financial advisor a cut of profits based on their contract with the firm for bringing them business. This could be a one time set payment or in the form of monthly royalties depending on the type of work done. \\n\\n\\u2022 For the types of work that require a license (for example, mortgages), the company pays for the new hire to take the course and exam to get the license, and they don't require it to be paid back to the company at any time. \\n\\n\\u2022 You can choose to onboard new candidates with or without the long term goal of owning your own brokerage under the company umbrella, or you can do none of that and only make money from your own clients. If you do it alone, you only make money from what you do individually, but if you have other advisors you helped on-board and train, then you make a little money off of their work as well. \\n\\n\\u2022 He primarily has referral partners in other fields to find new clients, but also uses software to find potential candidates (how he found me) and clients on the internet using keywords and filters.\\n\\n\\u2022 The financial advisor's compensation is directly related to their job title, and there are clear cut benchmarks for getting promotions (and therefore higher compensation). It sounded like the first couple of promotions happen within the first couple of months as the new hire gets more training and licenses completed. \\n\\nIt sounds on the surface like a fantastic opportunity, but the second and fifth bullet points have me raising one eyebrow pretty high, and I have seen the bait and switch too many times to take every word he says as gospel. My husband isn't sold either. I'm just wanting to know if these things are waving any red flags to others in this field or if all of this is standard and kosher, because neither of us has worked in a financial field ever so we don't know what to look for. I really want this to be my opportunity to make some supplemental income and give me something to do besides the usual SAHM stuff, but I'm hesitant to jump into something that sounds too good to be true.

Right after the initial post, I was planning my vacation for the remainder of the year (week 3 of 3rd week of vacation days). Within Workday, it showed vacation days unavailable, so I reached out to the internal recruiter of my company to inquire what the hell. She proceeded to ignore me, go straight to my boss who then told me it was in error, you should only have two weeks. Mind you, this is eight months into employment. Within an email that explained benefits, such as PTO, it says \\u2018Please ignore the attachment on the PTO you will be offered 3 weeks,\\u2019 along with time off benefits that includes the 3 weeks. There was an attachment that mentions two weeks but per the email, it states to ignore the attachment. Also, my former company, I had four weeks vacation, which I was willing to give up one for the 2 days in office and a flexible schedule, which sold me to work for this company. My boss at the time allowed me to have three weeks vacation for 2023 but moving forward it would be two. I reached out to the internal recruiter once again regarding a revised email stating 2 weeks and not 3. Two minutes later, I received a call from my boss to cease my communication to the recruiter and if I keep pursing, he would rescind the additional third week of vacation. \\n\\nFast forward to last month, my boss transferred into a new role within the company, I\\u2019m reporting to a new manager (a lot better and breathe of fresh air) and his boss (condescending). Again, I was sold on flexible/hybrid schedule and 3 weeks vacation. It\\u2019s been a year, to work remote, I have to ask for permission. I brought up the 3 weeks vacation to new boss and my offer email, he wanted something from recruiter, as he thinks I could\\u2019ve altered or retyped, which I\\u2019m still flabbergasted. Again, reached out to recruiter and her manager and received the most unprofessional email from her. The company defends her because she lied and said she verbally told me on our initial call last year, which was false. In a meeting with new boss and his boss, they failed to own up to the mistake and blamed me for accepting the terms, which was extremely misleading. I was upset in the meeting and told them I need to excuse myself, I got written up for just that. \\n\\nMost recently, I\\u2019d asked if I could be remote Thursday/Friday to visit my parents (7 hours away, leave Wednesday after work), still working both days. It was denied because they don\\u2019t trust I would be working, even though my parents are working too.

While I'm still learning, I acknowledge that some of my opinions may be naive. My apologies in advance. \\n\\nBackground: I'm a 23-year-old Indian with a commerce background, recently passing my CFA Level 1 exam. I've had a year of experience in audit at one of the Big4 firms, though I left in 2022 due to realizing it wasn't the right fit. Currently, I'm actively looking for job opportunities while pursuing a financial reporting internship, aiming to transition into portfolio management eventually.\\n\\nHowever, a lot of industry people I have connected with advised me that the industry is getting increasingly technical and quantitative. I also noticed the shift in required skill sets while I was applying to jobs. I have researched about Quantitative finance quite extensively and I know it\\u2019s extremely competitive and difficult for a finance grad to carve a place in the industry.\\n\\nNonetheless, I\\u2019m willing to put in the hard work and give it a try. I have the following options in order to pivot- \\n\\n- Pursue a part-time Bachelor's in Mathematics for three years, then apply for an MSQF program.\\n- Opt for a Master's in QF from a State University, which may not have a top ranking but offers decent placements. It's a two-year program with an entrance exam, so the learning curve isn't too steep. I'd appreciate your thoughts on the curriculum.\\n- Complete one-year Applied Mathematics diploma courses and then apply for an MSQF.\\n- Or perhaps I'm selling myself short and should apply directly for an MSQF? (I know a senior with a similar background and more experience who got into North-Eastern University MSQF.)\\n- complete Coursera courses on topics taught in MSQF like stochastic Calc, PDEs, etc and programming and apply for slightly quant roles. \\n\\n(If you\\u2019ve come this far along the post, I really really appreciate your consideration) I value your opinion and expertise on this matter. Each option has its pros and cons, but I'm committed to putting in the hard work to pursue the path that offers the best prospects for me.

I wanted to be a neurosurgeon for most of my adult life. But after taking my major classes at university, I realized that my passion had been more of an abstraction of the reality of being a neurosurgeon, rather than the real thing. I left school and spent a few months exploring myself, reflecting on my life so far, and trying to figure out exactly what I wanted to do with my life. I decided to pursue business, since before I wanted to be a doctor, I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I've been running a small eBay business, and within a month I've been able to replicate my revenue from my previous job, having only started with a $300 investment.  \\n\\n\\nThis journey has been really exciting. I've networked with a lot of business owners in my area, and even recently got a job in luxury sales to learn more about how businesses are structured, how chains of command work, how B2B transactions work, etc.. My first goal is to become the best seller in my store, and to match my business income to my work income. Although this has been fun, I'm realizing that my long term goal is NOT to only own my own business. I want to be a professional private investor. I want private investment to be my career. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere's the thing. I do not want to go back to school. I absolutely love learning, but I loathe taking tests, sitting in boring lectures, etc.. I am a hands on learner. I know I COULD go back to school, get a finance/economics etc degree. I had a 4.0 throughout my neuroscience pursuit. And I don't see a finance or economics degree being any more difficult at obtaining. But, I'd rather learn through hands-on experience. By investing my own money, reading materials and seeking out information that is relevant to my journey, learning pace, and personal necessity. I genuinely feel I have learned more about finance and investing in the past year than I've learned in school about any one subject, by doing it myself. And it's way more exciting.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI truly feel that sales experience will help me build relevant skills to communicate value, understand people better to close sales, build confidence in my communication skills, etc., while also learning about business structure from a 110+ year old successful business. In addition, my second goal is to start freelance copywriting to learn how to help businesses grow, and eventually having my own copywriting agency to learn more about different industries, customer bases, trends etc. straight from businesses themselves. After this point, is when I'm hoping to have the knowledge, experience, and capital to venture into private investments and help contribute to growing industries and businesses. I plan on supplementing my knowledge and growth with lots of reading, attending seminars, networking, etc.. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo my question is, what advice would you give to continue on my journey? Does this plan make sense? Am I going in the right direction? I would really appreciate advice from people who have experience in either private equity, a long history in investment, degrees in finance/economics etc., etc..

Here's an overview of my career to this point (~4 years work experience): I attended a non-target school where I majored in Marketing and Business Analytics & Information Systems. However, I managed to secure a position in a Finance Development Rotational Program at a Fortune 40 technology company. The program was highly demanding, offering a curriculum akin to an MBA and involving rotations in controllership, sales operations, and corporate development (M&A). Given my personal interest in the financial markets, valuation, and strategy, the corporate development role was particularly interesting to me. Thus, I was lucky to find a rotation where I was able to gain 6-months of tangible corporate development experience, along with experience on a live deal.\\u00a0\\n\\nUpon graduation from my development program, the corporate development team didn't have budget to take on additional headcount. Thus, I was luckily able to lateral to a F200 tech company where I am currently a Corporate Development & Strategy Analyst currently in a major US city. I currently enjoy the role very much as I'm on a small M&A team within a large strategy & corp dev organization. I'm able to evaluate tech businesses to buy to drive the business forward, while engaging in highly impactful strategy consulting projects as well. Moreover, many of my colleagues in the broader strategy group have either attended Harvard, Kellogg, Booth, etc., and are all previous MBB consultants which provides a phenomenal environment to learn from their expertise.\\u00a0However, deal volume has been quite slow, and I don\\u2019t have a ton of execution experience. Most of my experience has been large scale consulting projects, which leadership (Even c-suite) has acknowledged I have a natural consulting skillset.\\n\\nThe current challenge in my career stems from the fact that I was able to bypass the traditional paths of investment banking and consulting. While I appreciate the unconventional route I've taken, there's a lingering concern about potentially missing out on the \\\"rite of passage\\\" associated with these roles (i.e., Exit opportunities, fast-track to corporate leadership roles). This becomes particularly relevant when considering future competition for corporate development leadership positions, where individuals with investment banking backgrounds may have a perceived advantage. Consequently, I am contemplating pursuing a top MBA as a strategic move to augment my business acumen and skill set. However, I'm unsure of the true value of an MBA given: (1) I'm already in corporate development and would miss out on continuing to gain tangible experience unless I go part-time (2) Investment banking post MBA helps you gain valuable skills but the hours don't seem appealing or worth it, and the appealing exit ops (i.e., The reason I'd even choose banking would be for the option of potentially joining a HF/PE firm) are geared toward analysts (3) MBB/consulting travel doesn't seem sustainable to me long-term, but I'm aware of the industry/strategic exposure I'd receive that could put me ahead of my corporate peers. However, MBB/consulting experience isn't super relevant to the financial acumen, deal process, and modeling needed in corporate development anyway.\\u00a0MBB is the most enticing for me to pursue given I\\u2019ve been told I have a solid natural skillset from my projects. Also, having MBB on your resume opens doors and provides vast optionality. I\\u2019m honestly unsure if I even need an MBA to recruit for it? \\n\\nAs I stated above, I need some career advise. My aim is attain a leadership role in my future that is well-compensated, intellectually stimulating, and allows me leverage my financial, valuation, and strategic skillset (i.e., SVP Corp Dev, Long-only Fund Investor, Tech-focused PE role, or Strategy/Brand Management). Moreover, I want a role that helps me maintain a work-life balance for a future family, my health, and potential endeavors that may interest me outside of my conventional career (e.g., Entrepreneurship). If you could please help me contrast the paths a top MBA, investment banking, consulting, brand management, or staying in corporate development to help me optimize my career approach/planning that'd be fantastic!\\n\\nApologies for the long write-up, but I felt that ample context should help in crafting insights and advice. I appreciate any advise or insights provided!\\u00a0\\n\\nThank you! :-)\\n\"", "title": "Early Career Advice for Current Corp Dev Analyst: (1) MBA Worth It? (2) MBB/IB Worth It?

I've always heard it's not good or it's useless to get a Masters right after your Bachelors but I already went hard looking for a job to no avail. I'm thinking it will make me more qualified on paper and I should be able to get an internship during it. I haven't fully figured out the logistics, it's just something I've been thinking about the last couple days and I'd love some exterior feedback.\\n\\nP.S. Just so nobody larks on it, I didn't do any internships because I would put off applying to them in order to avoid choosing a career path or thinking about life after college. I have since been diagnosed with ADHD, have began to understand this, and am being treated for it.\"", "title": "Should I go back for a Masters?", "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1b5zy29/should_i_go_back_for_a_masters/"}, {"author": "popo4kia", "created_utc": 1709546928.0, "link_flair_template_id": "358c9434-f093-11ea-b9e0-0ea3e0990c5d", "link_flair_text": "Career Progression", "num_comments": 7, "post_id": "1b67f3t", "score": 1, "subreddit": "FinancialCareers", "text": "\" \\n\\nHi guys I would like to ask for advice \\n\\nMy goal is to enter big4 (preferably PWC) but any would do.\\n\\nCurrently I am working as an Audit intern (I had previous experience for one year in Deloitte as an ADC Audit analyst.
