I never wanted to have to ask something like this, but here I am.\\n\\nI (F17) have started a new job around a week ago at a large retailer. I am a cashier. Everything was going great, and I have loved my job until now. I have a coworker (M late 30s) who I will call John. \\nJohn is also a cashier, and often asks if I\\u2019ll be working the same shifts as him. When I confirm I am, he gets very excited. I just assumed it was so he wouldn\\u2019t have to take on as much of a workload if there was one more cashier. I get that, so I didn\\u2019t pay any mind to it. We didn\\u2019t talk to often and he simply offered to help me when needed. \\n\\nOn Friday, I worked until 10 PM. John was also working until 10 PM. My father came in and stood by my register until I got off my shift for around 15 minutes. John did not even talk to me that night, which was normal. \\n\\n2 days later, on Sunday, I am working the same hours, and so is John. As the day nears it\\u2019s end more of the cashiers end up going home. Me and John are working on adjacent registers, with the other cashier left working on the other end of the store. As the clock nears 10PM, John keeps talking to me more and more, more than I have ever experienced, to the point where he is ignoring customers at his register. I find this a little strange but maybe he is just bored after 7 hours at a cash register. At some point a customer in my lane brings a case of alcohol to me to check out which I cannot sell as I am 17. I ask John to please ring up the beer for the customer separately and he does so. A few minutes after the sale he comes over to me and compliments me on getting him to ring up the alcohol. I just reply with how I didn\\u2019t think I could legally sell it and I would rather be safe than sorry. 3-4 times over the shift he comes over and says the same thing, but each time he adds more on how \\u201cscared\\u201d I sounded. He then kept pressuring me to take his number, and gave it to me on a piece of paper. He told me I had to text him when we were in the store (which is mostly empty at 10 p.m.) so I could have his number. I don\\u2019t bring my phone to my register so thankfully he couldn\\u2019t have made me do it there. He told me I should text him if I needed help because I was new. This was very alarming to me because my friend who started the same position a day earlier than I did was never spoken to once by John. My friend presents as male and goes by a male name. I present as female and go by a female name. He told me multiple times that I needed to stick around and text him when we were both in the store to make sure I got his number. I did say I needed an answer to one thing,  which was how to take time off. I asked \\u201cHow do I take time off? Do I just write my name within the dates and reason for leave in the binder by the time clock?\\u201d This was a yes or no question. After this, he told me I had to follow him into the breakroom alone after 10 p.m. He kept insisting that we had to go alone. \\n\\nAfter this he said \\u201cI know you think I am a huge creep right now. I know in your brain you\\u2019re thinking \\u2018This guy is such a creep get away from me!\\u201d. I did think this but I didn\\u2019t comment on it. The fact he acknowledged the possibility of me finding him creepy was disturbing. He then said another thing which was very disturbing. He said \\u201cBut please come to the breakroom with me after work alone\\u2026 I know it sounds naughty because you\\u2019re 17 and I\\u2019m (late 30s)\\u2026 but please do it.\\u201d ok i need to break my professional writing here because WTF???? \\n\\n\\nHe closed down his register a bit before ten and waited for me. I counted down the seconds trying to make them last. He showed me the time off request binder, and confirmed everything I said. It could have been answered with a yes. The time off request sheets and binder are not in the breakroom though. I still needed to get my bag from the breakroom, so I went in there anyway and he followed. I tried as hard as I could to not acknowledge him by making eye contact or speaking. I got my bag very quickly and rushed out. He asked me about the phone number again, and I said my mom was waiting for me outside and I didn\\u2019t want her to be upset if I was late(Thank god she really was waiting outside for me.)

I literally transformed the company from a shit show to a high performance organization of 185 ppl. This is not just my POV but every department manager has acknowledged it.

You laid out a lot of pros and cons for me to consider as I try to negotiate a reasonable settlement. The comments about lawyers (both pro and cons) give me info on if I have any leverage if I chose that route in the end. Again, I hope it doesn\\u2019t come to that. But your your help I am now much more informed. THANK YOU!\\n\\nFINAL UPDATE: I successfully negotiated the company to give me 3 months of severance and cover my insurance for that time. I\\u2019m satisfied and glad that I didn\\u2019t have take it any further.

I told her that I do my classes and work at night, after work-hours, and that it hasn't affected my work. She asked me if I was planning on being full time at my new school, and I told her I was still trying to decide if I would transfer and hadn't made a decision.

I basically told her that my education was my own business and I didn't need her permission to look out for myself.\\n\\nThings were awkward for about a month, but eventually the work cycle just allowed things to return to normal. Then we had our performance reviews again. After submitting my section, I got to read her review and it was pretty horrendous.

She cited examples of times when my tasks were delayed, even though many of our tasks just have normal delays for normal business reasons.

The girl quit, but HR has so much evidence on her. \\n\\n(Side note: There was a big store meeting in May 2022 BEFORE I started working there.

This was my 1st job because many others: Chipotle, Panera Bread, Target, etc didn\\u2019t hire me.\\n\\nAlso Assistant Manager has been working for 23 years now. Although she gets transferred around every few years (not sure if it is complaint related). She has been at this exact store for 3 years now. I\\u2019m told that her work ethic has always been like this. I don\\u2019t know her too well as she is night shift manager so I only see her if I happen to work night. I do not I am a college student who prefers working mostly 8 am to 3 pm 2-3 days a week. I need money to pay for college and bills. We have had 1 big storewide meeting where everybody (16 workers at that time) had to come and sit down to talk about treating employees with respect.\\n\\nAdditional Edit: The phone confiscation thing is legitimate and allowed by the company and store. Many other people have their phones confiscated, after I left the freezer and clocked back in she confiscated this other college guy team member\\u2019s cell phone and put it in a safe.

Turns out, that discipline was started in April. (My agreement ended in July) because I kept \\\"harassing her and demanding extra vacation days.\\\" \\n\\nThe vacation request she was referring to was I needed two weeks FMLA to get a tumor removed. She maintained I didn't need the surgery, I should save my PTO and use that instead. I did argue with her almost daily for about two weeks over getting this surgery approved, and tried getting contact information to set up LOA, etc. She insisted I did not need the surgery, therefore didn't need the contact information, didn't need to do anything. I kept reminding her she's a nurse, not a doctor, especially not mine and can't decide that. \\n\\nIn April, I had enough, vented to another units supervisor, (C) who gave me the contact info. Coincidentally enough, that DAY I was supposed to be dragged into HR to discuss A's complaints. I emailed first and explained it was a surgery, not a vacation I wanted. I submitted doctors notes and such that A refused to accept. \\n\\nHR took my side, and gave me the leave, but didn't drop or inform me of the disciplinary actions she had filed. A then started icing me out of everything. Writing me up, making me take blame on situations where I wasn't even there, etc. I only found out about the discipline because I'm actively seeking a different job, away from her. She fought against me getting time off for radiation, and is deliberately under scheduling me/scheduling me on nights she KNOWS I can't work. \\n\\nShould I go back to HR yet a third time, or just cut my losses? B, the manager I spoke to is covering for A while she's on leave. I know several of my coworkers have waited until A was on leave to take similar complaints to B and she seemed unsurprised by mine. I mentioned that I want out and feel A is blocking me from being hired elsewhere. B originally interviewed me, she knows my resume. She agreed that it seems very suspicious. She offered me a spot on her unit, as have two other managers previously. (I used to float between units.) Every manager I've worked with wants me for their units. Should I take one of them up on it?

They said that they appreciate my forthcoming approach and explained that they are there to make everything run as smoothly as possible not only for me but also for her.

This coworker works in the department that the serial misnamer is in and I don\\u2019t talk to them much so I thought that was a bit fishy. Well I guess they asked her the same question and I was told all about it the next day by them and another employee in the same department. I was approached during my lunch and informed that not only had my coworker told them that HR was completely on her side but that they had overheard her speak to a client on the phone and say \\u201cOh she doesn\\u2019t work here anymore\\u201d.

I hadn\\u2019t received a request to meet with them and I thought for sure I was getting fired for engaging in discussion about the situation after being told not to. I waited and waited but my time never came. I ended up staying late to finish a few things and ended up leaving around the same time as people from her department. No sign of her. Today I came in early to prepare my office for a consultation and 4 people from that department were gathered around the coffee station talking about the lady. I heard one say \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe she did that\\u201d.

This guy, we\\u2019ll call him Z (18m), was hired in the beginning of this year. He was very awkward and I would catch him staring at me or other girls in our break room from time to time. I wasn\\u2019t scheduled with him for a while after the first few times, and after a couple months of not working with him, I was scheduled with him and noticed that he would casually slide his hands down his pants while other people were in the office. Keep in mind this wasn\\u2019t him simply \\u201cadjusting\\u201d or putting his hands in his pockets. He was very clearly touching himself. I started to keep an eye on him while we were in the break room, and I noticed that he would do it quite frequently, and sometimes put his fingers in his mouth after doing it. I was in the break room with my friend once, and I was across the room while he was sitting across from her and she was talking to me. I noticed her eyes widen and she gestured for me to look at Z, and out of the corner of my eye I saw him staring at me with his hands down his pants. \\n\\nAround a week later, I was scheduled with him again, and I made my shift supervisor aware of the issue, where I learned that he was also aware of Z\\u2019s behavior. My supervisor told me that if I saw him do it again to let him know, and he would have a conversation with him. I\\u2019ll let you figure out what happens next, but my supervisor had a conversation with Z that ended in him denying everything and saying that he was just on his phone. I went home and emailed HR that night. I met with HR the following week, where they took mine and another coworker\\u2019s statements, getting specific details of Z\\u2019s actions and \\u201cmovements\\u201d when he would touch himself. HR met with Z the following week, and they followed up with me and told me that they were very blunt with him that his actions would not be tolerated in the workplace, and told me to let them know if anything happened again and they would take action. I was very adamant that I did not want to be scheduled with him again, yet I worked with him multiple times after his meeting with HR. \\n\\nFast forward to around a month ago, Z comes into work just as my shift is ending, and lo and behold, I see him touching himself. I immediately reached out to my boss and HR, who I met with again the following week. This meeting was pretty much the same as the first one, with HR saying they would be addressing the situation immediately. However, my \\u201caccommodation\\u201d was that if I\\u2019m scheduled with him again, I can leave, no questions asked. He works a couple 3-hour shifts a month in the evening, whereas I work upwards of 25-30 hours a week, so in my opinion it\\u2019s not that hard for them to not schedule him with me. It\\u2019s been a month and I was told they would follow up with me after meeting with Z, and I haven\\u2019t heard a peep from my boss or HR.\\n\\nToday I was made aware by a coworker/friend of mine (16f) that Z was sent home and written up for touching himself. Instead of just an employee write-up, my coworkers who witnessed his behavior were asked by my supervisor to fill out security incident reports as well. The supervisor on duty also reached out to my boss immediately following the incident. I should also add that Z has been written up almost every shift he\\u2019s worked for either staring at female coworkers, putting his hands down his pants or overall being terrible at his job. \\n\\nI\\u2019m not sure what my next course of action should be if mine and my coworkers\\u2019 complaints are ignored yet again. I\\u2019m paid well at this job and I don\\u2019t want to be the one to quit because of this, but I am at a loss for what to do. I don\\u2019t have any \\u201cproof\\u201d of Z putting his hands down his pants aside from coworkers texting about his actions in a group chat. My parents have told me that if my workplace continues to ignore our complaints, it\\u2019s grounds for a lawsuit. Is this true? I don\\u2019t know what else to do.

By Thursday the entire team knew something was up and finally one of the other engineers asked what the fuck was going on and my boss said \\u201coh she has a bun in the oven, we gotta be careful around her, you know what hormonal women are like.\\u201d I was pretty pissed as I work with mostly men and this was not something I wanted divulged until I needed to coordinate coverage while on FMLA. I also really did not appreciate the insinuation that the state of being pregnant made me somehow unstable. Last month I had the highest QA score of anyone in the company, while pregnant. \\n\\nI asked my boss nicely but firmly to stop with the comments and he got mad. He said he\\u2019s \\u201cjust trying to make accommodations\\u201d per my letter. I explained again that I don\\u2019t need any accommodations and that he just needed to treat me exactly the same as always and nothing had changed. \\n\\nThen Friday I reviewed my pay stub and noticed it was lower than it usually is (payroll has been known to commit errors in the past). I contacted payroll and they said that the reduction had been approved by my boss for \\u201ctime not worked.\\u201d I emailed my boss and he said that he had deducted my two doctor\\u2019s appointments I had had during my first trimester retroactively because I wasn\\u2019t \\u201chonest\\u201d about the reason for the missed time (I was, I told him I\\u2019d be afk for a doctor\\u2019s appt for a couple of hours just not why).

I asked around and no one else gets time deducted for appointments, including one guy who goes to therapy every Tuesday at 10:30 (he volunteered  this information himself and everyone knows not to schedule meetings at this time). \\n\\nThen yesterday at about 11:25  I was on my weekly call with my client and get a meeting invite last minute from my boss for 11:30. I message him and tell him I\\u2019ll be late since I\\u2019m on my weekly call and he says \\u201cok.\\u201d Then when I call in he reams into me in front of everyone about how when he calls a meeting he expects everyone to be there, thankfully a couple of the guys stood up for me but it was very odd. After that meeting he calls me and says that if \\u201cthis behavior\\u201d continues he\\u2019s going to put me on a PIP because he \\u201cwon\\u2019t make any allowances\\u201d for me even in my \\u201ccondition.\\u201d I left the conversation feeling very confused as I am a top performer and he has not had any issues with me prior to last week, when I told him I was pregnant. \\n\\nTLDR My boss\\u2019s behavior has become erratic and retaliatory since disclosing my pregnancy.

As soon as my mentor emailed me his accounts of the meeting four other coworkers voluntarily emailed me theirs (these men gossip like hens and word got around quickly). Another former coworker who transferred to another department last year messaged me and said he had a similar situation happen when he challenged our boss about some comment. I saved everything on my personal computer and emailed it to my HR rep. Within about 20 minutes of sending that documentation I got another email from my rep requesting to move up the meeting and adding two other attendees- her Director and VP of HR. They confirmed what you guys said that this is discrimination, I\\u2019ll get the withheld payment repaid today.

I  had a meeting with HR today and it seemed a little unusual. I just am wondering if this is standard? The HR lady at my work today messaged  and stated she needed to meet with me immediately.. I was obviously concerned so I joined the virtual meeting(my job is 100% remote). She proceeds to tell me that she felt that two months ago I wasn't at home when I was working and was instead at a park playing with my children. Her reason being was because she thought she saw a tree in the background during a meeting we both attended and I once mentioned to her in passing that I liked taking my kids to the park. I was really surprised by this because 1) it happened two months ago and 2) how would I have a setup at the park? I cannot use my work platform on my phone and I have a desktop. She asked me to explain myself and I told her that I wasn't at a park, I was always home working during working hours and that I'm unsure how she thought I could be at a park where there is no internet and yet she saw me In a meeting. She paused and then told me that my children are also very loud during our weekly meetings she also attends and that she personally could always hear them. I again explained that this was not possible because my school aged children are in school during my working hours. She asked me to prove this so I offered to  send In attendance records from the school. She declined and said she believed me then suddenly turned cheery and asked if I had any questions. I asked if my job was in danger and she said no. Said  That she thought I was doing a great job and then ended the meeting. The whole thing was kind of bizarre to me because the park thing doesn't make any sense because, as I stated earlier, she saw me in that meeting . It also seemed odd she insisted she personally could hear my children during meetings when  they are not here while I work and I have proof of that. It seemed like what the meeting was about were more things she herself had experienced months ago and had issues with then Something my coworkers complained about. It was also weird how suddenly cheery she got at the end. a complete shift in mood from accusatory to cherry. It almost seemed like a test to catch me or something but I'm not sure how? Just the way her mood suddenly changed at the end was bizarre. Also why were these concerns not brought up months ago when they occurred.is HR allowed to call a meeting just because of something that saw or does there have to be an employee complaint. Does HR \\\"test\\\" you like that? Can someone make sense of this to me?\\n\\nUPDATE\\nSo I sent her an email offering to provide school attendance and location records for the days in question and reiterated that my kids were in school and largely not here during working hours or meetings .she responded that when she said meetings she actually meant when I was speaking on the phone with my coworkers that my kids were loud and that she personally heard the kids. Which again is impossible because they are not here. I doubled down and informed her there was no way the kids were being heard because they were not here and again offered attendance and location records . I also questioned how she personally heard the kids (as she stated) if I was on a private non recorded call with my coworkers. She declined saying that she didn't need any records  and only met with me because she wanted me to be successful. She didn't answer any questions about how she could hear my phone calls and directed me to drop the conversation. Now suddenly I'm being informed that I'm being sent for retraining on how to do my job and having to take a workplace harassment and behaviors training course at the discretion of HR. She made the deadline for tomorrow and I have a ton of work that also had to be completed so now I have to drop everything and do these courses. When I questioned why I was being sent for retraining I was informed that it was \\\"deemed necessary\\\" by HR even though I completed it three months ago when I started. \\n \"", "title": "[GA] Had a strange HR meeting today just looking for insight.", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/18gvn5j/ga_had_a_strange_hr_meeting_today_just_looking/"}, {"author": "Background_Trust3123", "created_utc": 1694469245.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 58, "post_id": "16g8om6", "score": 350, "subreddit": "AskHR", "text": "\"Had an email waiting for me when I opened my in-box.
