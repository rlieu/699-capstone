As evidence, she provided a picture of off-white material on the door as well as testimony that the material glowed under UV light. She further stated that she \\\"just knows how perverts are\\\" and that the residue was at waist height. Lastly, she claimed that, because she resides in a hot and arid locale, it was unlikely to be caused by some natural liquid event.\\n\\n**Response**\\nPosters in the thread tended to be dismissive of the claims for several reasons. First. many provided personal experience with a variety of other fluids, including puddles on the road, lawn sprinklers, tree sap, and bird excrement, all of which have left splash patterns and residues similar to the provided picture. To counter the UV claim, especially in light of the CSI trope that bodily fluids glow under this light, it was pointed out that numerous other substances exhibit similar fluorescence, including some of the alternative suggested causes. There was also a professed belief that dried semen does not take on the depicted form. Finally, questions were raised regarding the plausibility of the action, as despite massive evidence that extreme sexual perversions do exist (cf. *United States vs. One Book Called Ulysses*), it was hard to fathom someone gaining sexual pleasure from this particular act. Despite this rejection, OP remained steadfastly devoted to their claim.\\n\\nAs such, I felt that it would be necessary to provide more evidence against this belief. To this end, I engaged\\nin several masturbatory events with a car to create a visual record of what ejaculate on a car door looks\\nlike.\\n\\n**Experimental methodology** \\nThe subject is a young adult male with no history of sexual dysfunction. To guarantee a large volume of the ejaculate, subject refrained from release for a period of four days prior to the test. Furthermore, normal diet was supplemented with extra water to guarantee hydration and eight stalks of celery, which anecdotally is claimed to increase semen production. The exact experiment consisted of three sessions, spaced four hours apart, conducted in a chair and concluded by standing and ejaculating onto a car's door. Subject was provided approximately two teaspoons of lubricant per session, and all external stimulation was limited to a January 2013 Penthouse magazine. The results were photographed until the ejaculate dried.\\n\\n[Pictures Here](https://imgur.com/a/yUV9T)\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\nThis album contains the original pictures of OP as well as the results of the experiment. As can be seen, there is a noticeable difference between the appearance of what was claimed to be semen and what actually is semen. Therefore, it is very doubtful that anyone masturbated onto OP's car, and it can be assumed that some other substance is the cause of the residue.\\n\"", "title": "That was probably not jizz on OP's car", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/6z88pl/that_was_probably_not_jizz_on_ops_car/"}, {"author": "Joseph-King", "created_utc": 1589857010.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 97, "post_id": "gmgb0e", "score": 2773, "subreddit": "LegalAdviceOffTopic", "text": "\"\"", "title": "This belongs here", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "url": "https://i.redd.it/mp4lu2oa4mz41.jpg"}, {"author": "probonolawyer2017", "created_utc": 1513377592.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 422, "post_id": "7k37fj", "score": 2220, "subreddit": "LegalAdviceOffTopic", "text": "\"Somebody suggested I post about my issue on this subreddit. \\n\\nI recently graduated law school and started working at a non-profit firm, providing free legal services to low income individuals.\\n\\nI always wanted to work in either government or non-profit, as I always believed in St. Thomas' principles of helping others. However, it has turned to be a complete headache.\\n\\nThe clients are driving me nuts!\\n \\nThe main problem is the walk ins. \\nThey walk-in every day without appointments, and expect me to stop what I am doing to help them. One who expected me to stop during my appointment I had with another client to help her. I will have up to five walk ins in one day. The problem with the constant walk ins is that the receptionist speaks English, and does not speak Spanish, so if they walk in I have to be the one who speaks to them. With the constant walk ins, I have to be a part-time receptionist. The constant walk ins burn me out by the end the day. Additionally, it is hard for me to get the other work I have done if I have to play receptionist all day.\\n\\nMy second problem is how many \\\"no show\\\" appointments I have. I can understand if somebody calls and cancels in advance because of work schedules fluctuate and I'm usually understanding,  but some literally do not show up. Two or three times. It's frustrating because it not only delays finishing up their case, but it takes time away that I could be helping another person. \\n\\nThe third problem is when I give them a list of documents they *need* to bring to the next appointment in order to do the next part, and they don't bring them, and then they have to come back multiple times to finish. I have assignments that should have finished in one day that take two months to finish.  It makes the process completely slow and all the extra time I am taking to finish these cases, it makes the entire system slow. \\n\\nIt's complete inefficiency and it makes the job not just hard but frustrating.  I am always burnt out by the end of the day. \\n\\nLastly, while most of my clients are wonderful, some of them are rude. One lady sucked her teeth at me when I told her that it was out of my job description to get her an info pass appointment (I'd have to get up at 5 am to try to get her an open slot). I called another lady back and she said: \\\"It took you guys that long to call me back?\\\" I'm putting 110% in my cases, and put hours and hours in a case to make sure they get the best representation, so it is shocking that my effort is so undervalued to them. \\n\\nMaybe I was naive to think there would always be some form of appreciation because a private lawyer would cost thousands of dollars, money that they cannot afford. \\n\\nAny advice on how to go about with pro-bono clients and serving a low income population?\\n\\nUPDATE: Thanks for the responses. I have been thinking about this all night and it really opened my eyes. Now that I think about it, some of my clients are not just poor, but the poorest of the poor. They are adults, but in reality they're like children. The social norms that we know about appointments, etc., they may not have had the opportunity to learn. \\n\\nWith all that in mind, I am starting to believe I am not cut out for his, no matter how good my intentions are.  I am burnt out after only 3 1/2 months. \\n\\nMy only concern is, if and when it is time for me to leave, who helps these people?  And if people are constantly leaving non-profit, who helps these people?\"", "title": "Pro-bono clients are driving me mad.

My three children (14M, 16F, and 18M) I had with my ex-wife had been living with me for almost 10 years at the time of this story. Our custody was technically joint, but the military moved me out to the other side of the country, so the reality was that they lived with me except for Christmas, Spring, and Summer breaks. \\n\\nOur oldest graduated at the very end of May and my ex and her parents flew out to CA for the graduation. She was coolly cordial, which was the nicest she'd been to me in years. I thought things were turning around and that we could be maybe be friendly again.

What she did, instead, was to pull the county's family court roster for the county where this action was filed. She made note of whose names popped up the most and we started working our way down that list. Her thought being that these lawyers not only handled family court issues, but were in front of those judges on a regular basis. They'd know the judges and the judges would know them.

The OWI charge was \\\"lessened?(not sure of the exact term)\\\" to a Public intox.

Lawyer said it that it was just barely visible in the corner of the vid, but it was the key to proving that the engine wasn't running and thus \\\"I couldn't actually operate the vehicle\\\". Glad that that one was cleared, especially since it is a criminal offence in my state.

I'll be taking a $200 drink-driving class as it is needed for me to reinstate my license, wondering if that is something I should ask my lawyer to contest as per the result of the case.

All in all, bullet dodged I guess, aha my lawyer told me that he thought I was bs-ing until he saw the bodycam, apparently he's heard the \\\"car wasn't running story\\\" alot.
