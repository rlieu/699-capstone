The semester is halfway done, and I've had three observations so far (out of a total of six that will be done in total). I only just got formal written/rubric feedback from my supervisor for my observations (those are shared via a program called Taskstream, and the supervisor didn't manage to get into the system until this week) but I got back plenty of verbal feedback after each observation. Each time, she was very positive, giving me a bit of advice on how to improve but mostly talking about my strengths and saying I was doing very well. I made it very clear in all three post-observation meetings that I am very much open to criticism and advice, and figured that the relative lack of constructive criticism meant I was just doing reasonably well.\\n\\n\\nAnd then this week I finally got my formal written feedback/rubrics, filled out by the same supervisor. And it turns out I'm currently doing pretty poorly actually - just barely passing at all. The final grade is calculated by how we do on these rubrics, with the rubric area scores being \\\"proficient\\\", \\\"developing\\\", and \\\"below standard\\\". In order to get a B, we need \\\"proficient\\\" in at least 10/18 rubric areas, and getting a \\\"Below standard\\\" in more than one area is an automatic \\\"fail\\\" (having a \\\"below standard\\\" in just one area is an automatic C).\\n\\nAnd it turns out I've been getting absolutely zero \\\"proficients\\\" and have a single \\\"below standard\\\". So, just barely passing.\\n\\nI get that I'm far from the best student teacher, and don't necessarily feel that I don't deserve this grade (at first I just thought my supervisor was a very easy grader or something). I'm working while student teaching in order to not be homeless, and I get that this means the quality of my work would probably be lower than most of the folks in the program. \\\"Just barely passing\\\" is still \\\"passing\\\" and while my application for jobs going forward would be weakened significantly by that, I'd still have some chance of being a teacher, so whatever.\\n\\nBut I'm kind of pissed that my supervisor's verbal feedback has been so different from the actual grades/scores, and that she has been so positive on feedback with such little negative, in contrast to what she's actually been grading me with. I'm *genuinely* fine with criticism, even harsh/strong criticism. \\n\\nI know these teacher prep programs are really scraping the bottom of the barrel to get people to join their programs (and still having far fewer people join than in past years, in my program's case) due to the teacher shortages and lack of interest in becoming a teacher, and that's almost certainly how I got in at all. So I'm guessing that they've had issues in the recent past with us lower-tier program members responding very poorly to criticism and potentially going ape-shit over it, in which case, like, I get why supervisors would be very reluctant to give negative feedback in-person, and why they'd prefer to just give the negative grade. But it still sucks if that's the reason I didn't get that feedback, since I know I wouldn't react like that\\n\\nSo now I'm halfway through, having gotten used to thinking I was doing good and just now realizing that I basically need to make major improvements in every area if I want more than the bare minimum C grade for student teaching. Would have really been nice to have that information earlier - we've been told through our program that we should really all be getting As in student teaching and that as long as we listen to our feedback, we should all get As, but its hard to do that when I only get the \\\"real\\\" feedback halfway through the student teaching after being led to believe I was doing a very good job. Also feels like our prior courses in the program could have prepared us better, since I managed to get basically all As in the program prior to student teaching, and these rubrics we are scored with are scored to much higher standards than we were exposed to in our classes. I get that it makes sense (the expectations are higher when you are actually in the classroom vs in a college class being introduced to things for the first time and throwing around ideas without seeing how they apply) but it still just feels a little, idk, kinda frustrating. Like ultimately the other students in my program are probably just doing way better than me, and I'm just a very mediocre teacher-candidate, and on the other hand I do also still have more time to improve so I can get a better grade too, so I don't really have grounds to complain all that much. But it's still a big bummer to suddenly realize I'm doing much worse than I was led to believe, and later than I'd have wished to learn that...\"", "title": "Student teaching problems rant", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bh49re/student_teaching_problems_rant/"}, {"author": "KW_ExpatEgg", "created_utc": 1710643097.0, "link_flair_template_id": "71f2aa60-b428-11ee-8f12-fa0f499e77d1", "link_flair_text": "Just Smile and Nod Y'all.

It felt like new lease on life when I went from daily subbing, to maternity sub, to getting hired as a full-time teacher this year.   \\nWelp, on March 15 the (new to the school, old to the district) principal forwarded me an email with someone I'd never heard of in HR in which there is a screenshot of my name and ID number and he emailed \\\"I definitley don't want her back next year. Can I wait until next Friday to tell her due to the upcoming meeting?...No she's temporary and credentialed so you need to tell her by Mar 15\\\"  \\nI immediately responded and asked him for context and he called me into his office while I was teaching and told me he wouldn't be rehiring me, but I could apply for jobs elsewhere in the district (my union rep says this is not \\\"non-reelecting\\\" which puts a mark on your application to other public schools). Based on his past impulsivity and mounting stress due to budget cuts and parents angry at his unilateral decision making, I'm pretty sure he accidentally forwarded me that email  when he meant to hit reply and was hoping to get away with keeping me ignorant about my temp release status for a bit longer.   \\nI have already thought to myself several times throughout the school year that I don't know if I could go back to working in a non-amazing school. Our school year goes until late May, so I have 2 months ahead of me. In order to feel minimally prepared for the day I usually do 1-2 hours of work M-Th and about 3-6 hrs of work each weekend.   \\nWe have our grades's first one night camping trip ahead of us and me and my new, uncredentialed colleauges (who will liekly have to change schools in order to get placed with a mentor teacher next year) agreed to be on the camping trip (so an overnight of unpaid work). Last week I announced I'd turn the curriculum reading into a play the students could perform and they were SO EXCITED, and our school culture is that most people do a fair amount of teachers only social outings, volunteering to help at or attend school sponsored cultural events and projects. I don't think there is actual pressure to do these things, but I have liked to participate in some of these.   \\nWhat are your tips for getting through the last 2 months where everyone is so excited about all these extra activities that take so many hours of unpaid work on top of all the unpaid work I already do to feel ok about the quality of my work? At least 2 other people know they are on the chopping block due to budget cuts and likely others are as well due to budget cuts.   \\nTomorrow we'll have a union meeting and I told my union reps (who were so caring and supportive) I would share about my notice of not being rehired with my fellow teacher union members. Knowing the culture of the teachers (2 of whom have students in my class), I'm sure people will ask how they can help and support me. I'm not sure what to tell them.   \\nI am interesting in continuing to teach, but I also wonder if this is an opporunity for me to start over and teach in a radical community, go back to subbing and tutoring and do something more passionate on the side with all the extra time I'll have from not working 8-20 extra hours per week. \"", "title": "Tips for managing stress & sadness after March 15 Temporary Contract Release", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bh5alr/tips_for_managing_stress_sadness_after_march_15/"}, {"author": "Starlit_Seaside", "created_utc": 1710714956.0, "link_flair_template_id": "fe0a214e-146a-11e9-893d-0e90c126802c", "link_flair_text": "Teacher Support &/or Advice", "num_comments": 3, "post_id": "1bhawey", "score": 1, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"I worked at a middle school as a long-term sub for the past two months.

However I see a lot on this sub about how you guys can't stand most corps members that you work with- how can I be a \\\"good one\\\"?

I've already started researching classroom management and lesson planning tips for myself (any resources would be appreciated!).

The last month has been toxic at my site. I love my school overall. It has many benefits from students, helpful parents, pay, flexibility etc. I do not want to leave but I have to say I have pondered it because at times I feel like the staff makes me not want to be there. Here is what has occurred. The staff lounge is toxic of others badmouthing other staff members on the daily.  I am 100% positive stuff is said of me when I\\u2019m not there. It is basically whoever is not present gets talked about.. very toxic. I have reduced my time in the lounge. Luckily the problems at the school are between other staff members and not me. I do not feel that I have personally done anything wrong. The worst is that others may have complained about my stipend as an after school director not being fair to other job stipends. The last thing is that my vp who deals with the discipline at my school made a passive aggressive joke to another teacher during a staff meeting that we cannot get a student in trouble for calling otherr students names such as animals. Saying something sarcastically like \\u201cgod forbid they call each other these things.\\u201d I have written a student last week for this exact thing! My admin even used the same word that was said by the student I wrote up. I\\u2019m confused and have lost trust in admin. I don\\u2019t feel that someone in that role as vp should make negative comments to others about another person and/or me as this is not a healthy environment to work in. I\\u2019m not sure the route to take. Inside I want to address the comment to my vp but I also don\\u2019t know if I am overreacting and should just let it go. I do feel that I will start being more vocal in my boundaries. \\n\\nThe bigger problem at the site is problems between other employees and all of it gets mentioned around campus. It\\u2019s tiring to hear the complaining. There is a lot of positive things about my site it\\u2019s just the last month has been a weird vibe with contract negotiations, discipline problems, teachers being vocal on others employees, etc. \\n\\nWhat is the best route? I\\u2019m already reducing my time in the lounge. Should I address with my admin the environment? Does anyone have experience how addressing it with admin actually makes a difference? Especially when part of the problem is the admin?!

Massive amount of poverty, English language learners and has been a mess for decades. A small scandal arose after a counselor changed the failing grades to passing grades. \\n\\nI knew what the eventual outcome would be as would most of you. The district has implemented a byzantine policy of contact and recovery for failing students that is placed on the shoulders of the teacher. These teachers put the failing grades in and were threatened with changing them to passing if the policy was not followed. \\n\\nWell, the counselor changed the grades and this was a minor scandal in January and the district said they would get to the bottom of the grade changes.

They answered that way because they did not want to be on the record stating to change the grades. \\n\\nI give credit to the teachers that failed the students. I\\u2019ve been in enough meetings where we are told that we have to give multiple contacts and documentation, we must offer remediation plans for each student and more. Experienced teachers know that the admin is really saying \\u201cwe will make it very difficult for you to fail a student\\u201d.

I see kids for 90 minutes one on one typically once a week. I have kids all over the board in terms of where they're at in their education. When I was hired I wasn't given any sort of information about being a mandated reporter or anything like that, and this is where I need some serious advice.\\n\\nI have a student, I will call them A. They're a brilliant 6th grader, who's working with SAT level vocab and killing it. I've been working with them for a few months now. When we first met, their father 'warned' me that they had social anxiety and autism. A didn't talk for the first 20-30 minutes of our first session. I introduced myself to them, did everything I could to establish our classroom as a safe space. After awhile we progress was made and they started talking a bit. The way some previous tutors had treated them makes me sick. But now, after seeing them weekly for approximately 3 months, they talk from the moment they get into the room until the moment they leave.\\n\\nNow what worries me is \\\\*what\\\\* they say. It started off with 'small' things, like finding out that their father calls them obese. A joke or two about getting beat. Most of my students, who tend to be Asian, make comments like that, something something typical Asian parents. I try and follow those by asking if they feel safe at home, and they typically laugh and say yes. A did not say that. A said \\\"I'd like to believe so.\\\" Obviously that is concerning, and it haunts me at night, but I'm not trained for this.\\n\\nSome other things A has talked about are their parents withholding food as a punishment: \\\"Even if we don't feed you, you'll live. You're so fat anyways.\\\" Belittling them: \\\"No one will love you.\\\"\\\"If you don't stop dressing like \\\\[opposite gender\\\\] you'll be unlovable.\\\" Abandonment: \\\"If you don't like it then leave, you're not my child anymore.\\\" Threatening to leave A and their mother if they speak against A's father. Being kicked out of the car to walk home. Being sent to military camp. It goes on an alarming amount.\\n\\nThe writing assignment I gave them this week was to write a letter to their future self, when they graduate from high school. A asked if they could bring in their list of why they're depressed. It comes from the school they're attending where they're bullied and the staff doesn't do anything to help, their friends that attend different schools drifting away from them, and the abuse they suffer from their parents (mostly their father). I told them they could add that if they wanted to seal it away, but I wanted them to be hopeful and kind to themselves.\\n\\nI asked them this week as well, if they had ever talked to their friends parents about what happens at home. A said yes, but they were always accused of exaggerating. As a child of abuse myself, this hits home hard. The way that A talks and behaves, to me it just screams that they're telling the truth. But as I've stated. I have NO idea how to go about this. I don't want to do something incorrect and have their home life get worse because of me. That's what's majorly held me back from saying anything.\\n\\nI finally reach out now, because I'm looking for another job. I need full time work, and my heart absolutely hurts thinking about leaving A. I don't know how to help them, and I don't know if it's appropriate at all for me to give them a way to reach out to me after I'm no longer their teacher. Any advice and thoughts AT ALL would be so greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.\\n\\n**tl;dr** I have a 6th grade student I'm fairly certain is being abused at home for sure emotionally, and maybe physically.

I am thinking she is talking about the flow chart thing you use for computers or decision-making. So, I pull up this lesson plan and her eyes go wide.\\n\\nI instantly realize that this isn't it. She meant how to add and subtract negative numbers. Her teacher is calling this process an algorithm, according to her. I know this teacher and he is an English teacher by degree, so I can understand his confusion. (Again, weird school system.) Though technically correct because it is a decision-making process, she now thinks that this is what an algorithm means.\\n\\nThis isn't the first time I have come across this type of confusion. It happens all of the time. Every time I get a new student who is learning about negative values for the first time, they call the process an algorithm. Then when the actual algorithm lesson comes around, they get all confused.\\n\\nSo, let's just all collectively agree to stop calling the operational processes involving negative numbers algorithms. Yes, it is technically correct, but it is confusing and meaningless. It is like calling all clothing blankets because they cover your skin. (I am wrapped in one now.)\\n\\nAnd as a further aside, can we stop teaching addition and subtraction as two separate processes when it comes to negative numbers? They are the same process. And yes you can subtract a small from a big using the traditional \\\"algorithm\\\" without borrowing or trading. If you are going to teach borrowing/trading, then please teach the students why it works and why we are doing it that way. If you do, it makes working with large negative values so much easier.\\n\\nEdit: I have read through many of the comments. Most of them are saying that I am a troll or upset for teaching kids a specific word. I would like to ask the teachers to ask their students, especially younger ones, if they can define algorithm. Many of my students can't. If you asked what they learned in school and they say algorithms, that is it. They think that whatever they learned that week is an algorithm, but they can't go on to explain it or give examples. So, there I am, asking for details, which operation? Negative numbers? Decimals? Fractions? I have had many students even tell me that decimals are not used in algorithms. All that I ask is that you define the term better if you use it. Ask your kids to define it for you.

I feel so ashamed that my CT sometimes intervene during discussions despite me knowing at the back of my mind that I studied it for three years in college yet I still suck at it. Sometimes, I panic after that since it makes me doubt if I'm truly capable of continuing the lesson. The students that I currently handle are really engaged when I teach despite some misbehaving from time to time. I really feel like they are eager to learn. I feel guilty in most cases because it feels like I'm trying to give what I do not have.  I'm so lucky with my CT, she doesn't burden me much of the paper work despite her having electives as well. She gives a lot of feedback in a good and constructive way. There are times where she would spoon feed the improvement that I need to learn which makes me feel even more ashamed. My final demo which will be attended by my supervisor will be on the 19th,next week. And I don't know if I would meet the goal that the program is looking for.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThat's enough of my rant I guess, back to me contemplating on my inadequacies.\"", "title": "Another student teacher rant", "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bg3xw1/another_student_teacher_rant/"}, {"author": "Formal-Editor4165", "created_utc": 1710608552.0, "link_flair_template_id": "42b34e12-b428-11ee-856f-e2416d936128", "link_flair_text": "Charter or Private School", "num_comments": 2, "post_id": "1bgaq83", "score": 0, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"I have been working at a charter school this year and have struggled with admin, regional admin and the lack of support that I was promised at the beginning of the year.

He has never been at a school for more than two years. Let me break it down. \\n\\n\\u2022The 2018-2019 school year, he got his first teaching position as a long term (in this case, a year) sub. When his year was up, the old teacher came back and there were no open positions at that school. I had a two year term position ending at my workplace and we took this as an opportunity to move closer to family. \\n\\n\\u2022During the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 school year, he secured a position in our new area. Things were great, he began advising the GSA, he liked his coworkers, but at the end of 2021, he was non-renewed. We suspect it had something to do with being out and trying to be inclusive in his teaching of history as the principal had once told him to \\u201cstop talking about kitchen table issues,\\u201d but he was also the youngest and newest teacher in the department so we chalked it up to that. \\n\\n\\u20222021-2022, he got a position at a middle school in a fantastic district that he had originally wanted to work in. He worked hard, kept his head down, didn\\u2019t ruffle any feathers, but at the end of the year, enrollment at the school was anticipated to drop the next year. Once again, being the youngest and newest teacher, he was non-renewed. \\n\\n\\u20222022-2023 and this year, he got a job teaching at his dream high school in that same fantastic district. He ended up taking on teaching AP Psych which he loves and is very passionate about. His AP Psych test pass rates are higher than the other teacher who has been teaching it for 10+ years now. The school didn\\u2019t have a GSA advisor when he started so he took that over and has really helped facilitate a robust and active GSA that is going to be hosting a summit for all other GSAs in the district this Spring. He was offered a position on the LGBTQIA+ advisory board at the district level. He loves love his coworkers and they seem to really love him. \\n\\nBut today, admin let the staff know that enrollment was down and each department would be losing people. He\\u2019s back on the chopping block for non-renewal because he\\u2019s the youngest in the department and while he\\u2019s not the newest, he\\u2019s the only one who isn\\u2019t tenured. If someone retires at the end of the year, he\\u2019ll be fine, but right now\\u2026.it\\u2019s unclear if he\\u2019ll have a job next year at this school. \\n\\nI\\u2019m just so upset and frustrated. These non-renewals have put so much stress on both of us. His first one in 2021 came the spring after we\\u2019d bought our house so we were worried about paying the mortgage. I make good money at my job and our mortgage is on the smaller side (less than rent in our area thanks to pandemic interest rates). We don\\u2019t live beyond our means, but we definitely need his salary to survive. And now this possible one is coming at the absolutely worst time. We are due with our first child in May. We decided to start trying for a baby because we felt like we were stable financially and were going to be able to pay for the mortgage and daycare and everything else. But now things are all up in the air again and it\\u2019s sending me into an anxiety spiral and him into a depressive state. These non-renewals just make him doubt himself so much. I can see him trying to be upbeat, but he\\u2019s clearly beating himself up and second guessing every single thing he\\u2019s done this year even though one of the VPs sought him out after the meeting and let him know that if he is non-renewed (which is not a certain thing), it is not a performance issue. All his observations the past two years have been great and he is, from what I can tell, generally well liked by his students and their parents. \\n\\nI thought teaching was a stable career. I didn\\u2019t realize this is something we would be dealing with a lot. I thought there was a teacher shortage? Am I missing something? To me, he doesn\\u2019t seem like a bad teacher, but I only see what any other spouse of a teacher sees. He genuinely seems like a fantastic teacher from what I see and from his work stories. He really does seem to be teaching for \\u201cthe right reasons.\\u201d \\n\\n Any perspective from teachers on how I can comfort him and provide him support during this time? I\\u2019m trying to put aside my own fear and sadness and frustration to just be his support system right now. \\n\\nHis coworkers are throwing us a baby shower in late April and I just feel like I don\\u2019t have the stomach to walk into that school and smile and be in a good mood when there\\u2019s a chance he\\u2019s gonna be ousted in the following days. I know his coworkers have very little control of the situation but I still don\\u2019t know if I can put on a happy face and celebrate our baby with them when all I feel like doing is crying and worrying about our ability to make ends meet. \\n\\nTLDR: husband has been non-renewed twice with another possible one at the end of this year and I\\u2019m scared and need to support him\"", "title": "Teacher Husband keeps getting non-renewed.

The student then went to the office and told on me.  The student's mom filed a formal complaint with the superintendent.  Apparently, they are claiming I threatened the student.  The VP/dean of students warned me of all this and encouraged me to talk to the principal before leaving this Wednesday (the VP/dean of students is scared of this kid and his mother; they tried to get his license).  I got a Union representative to sit on the meeting with the principal.  Things went pretty well.  Principal said he was going to call the parent and explain.  This afternoon (Thursday), my classroom phone rings with a cellular #.  Like a dumbass, I pick up, and it was the mom trying to schedule a meeting.  She said she has been trying to schedule a meeting with me for a week and the principal and superintendent have yet to help her.  I asked her if her son would be a part of the meeting and she said she figured I may want to APOLOGIZE to the student for what I said.  \\n\\nNow for the back story:\\n\\nI had this student last year.  Few people are a fan of this kid or his mom.  He is a bully and tries to get under people's skin.  His mom comes to every school board meeting and makes accusations of us being pedophiles, groomers, etc.  She tells everyone to unenroll their students and homeschool.  She has even claimed to be getting a charter to start her own school.  Her son and her managed to play a role in a teacher getting fired earlier in the year.  I've had a student like this before that thought they got a teacher fired.  They thought they walked on water.\\n\\nThree weeks ago, he had his phone on him (we have a strict no-phone-policy for our middle school students; they are not to be on their person at all; phones are to stay in their lockers).  I told him to put it in his locker.  He responded by telling me to get on everyone else with their cell phones on them.  The student then walked into his next class and sat down.  The teacher noticed this and sent him to the office.  I don't really understand this sentiment, other than an attempt at deflecting, as I will tell any kid with a cell phone to do the same.  Hell, I even told the school nurse's son to put his away the same week.  \\n\\nLast Thursday, I was out and had a sub in my room.  On Friday, a student informed me that this student had been ding ding ditching my room continuously during the last period of the day.  Later on Friday, two more students told me the same.  One of the students stressed concern that I not use their name, as they were afraid of being \\\"beat up\\\" by the student.  I stepped out of the school during my planning period, and the student in question was in the hallway.  That is when I talked to him.\\n\\nMy plan for tomorrow is to spin this meeting around.  Mom is expecting me to apologize, I imagine, but as more and more time goes on, I feel like I did little to nothing wrong.  It was advice more than anything.  My plan is to explain why I said what I said, including mentioning the student's behavior.  My wife feels like I should just apologize and let this die.

Sorry for the long text...\\n\\nTLDR: A student told another student I annouced to the class I was happy they were absent, now parent has completely severed my self esteem and even further solidified my want to change careers.\\n\\nI (f mid 20s) teach in a suburban middle school. It is my first year at the school, 4th overall, and I genuinely enjoyed it until November, but have since found the same patterns of my past school. I have great relationships with the kids, test scores are up, and in general my biggest obstacles are school wide: chronic absenteeism, students engaging in physical behaviors (fights in the halls and classes, constantly getting out of seats, throwing objects at friends, boys trying to wrestle each other, etc.), frequent staff turnover, parents always seem to have the upperhand, the kids are never wrong, and the teachers are never working hard enough. Well, about a week ago a student was absent and their friends were dramatic in a very work avoidant way. \\\"Mrs -, they aren't here, what will we do?!\\\" I, very casually as a redirection, replied that maybe they could use our class time to get their work done. Come the day the absent student returns, I find out their peers had told them I said, in front of the class, that I was happy they were absent because they keep others from getting work done.\\n\\nNow, I can see how a few middle schoolers might spin my words that way, but it is not what I said. I clarified this with the student and when they replied they couldn't believe I'd say that, I told her I was telling the truth: I said they should use class time to get work done. The student then sat down and returned to work.\\n\\nI get home to a nasty email from the student's mother claiming I am uncompassionate, my classroom must be a chaotic zoo, and that I was bullying her child. I clarified as I had with the student and proposed meeting with admin to further clarify what really happened, but the parent did not respond. I emailed admin to give them a heads up, and the next day the parent called looking for a meeting.\\n\\nI spent 40 minutes after school being screamed at by this parent, called all sorts of names and accused of being a horrible person and future parent, while my principal sat in with little interjection. I didn't say anything until cued to respond with an apology and proposal to meet with the child and principal to restore the relationship, to which the parent scoffed and said she had to beat it out of me.\\n\\nI already doubted wanting to stay in this profession, but I am shocked and defeated at this point. I love teaching my subject, but I can't believe I was subjected to what felt like verbal abuse for the sake of placating a parent over an event that never happened. Am I in the Twilight Zone? Is this really what teachers are expected to do? I am so hurt that my principal didn't step in to cut this parent off when the conversation became more of a character slam than anything else. I am upset the parent is believing third hand accounts from middle schoolers. I can't laugh to avoid crying anymore. I work so hard.

It is very important to me that the children find it interesting and that the materials are accurate. When I first started teaching, I constantly ran out of time to prepare as I would have liked. The time for the lesson would come, and I had to work with what I had. Each subsequent year I made the lesson a little better. About five years ago, I felt that the lessons finally began to feel complete; they were neither too complex nor too simple, balanced, and filled with precise and structured information. The only thing missing was interactivity - initially, I made materials for the lessons either out of paper or in the form of presentations. I decided to master Unity and create interactive programs. It seemed to get even better. All this time, I never stopped working with the children in the club, and gradually I started transitioning to interactive programs. Everyone liked it. Judging by the webvisor, there was always at least a small number of people engaged on the site.  \\nJust over a year ago, due to circumstances, I had about a year when I was at home for a long time. I thought - hooray, finally, there is time to finish everything and stop not because time ran out, but because it was done well. I dived headfirst into the computer, and went through each lesson many times, searching for and eliminating inaccuracies and unclear places. About two weeks ago, I finally finished. That is, it was also not the end - just what was already posted on the site, in my eyes, became complete. And I decided - it's time, now I'm not ashamed to show it to people. I created a group on Facebook, and launched advertising - and no one came. Judging by the webvisor, people go to the first page, where just buttons lead to the lessons, and leave. No one opens the programs and engages. I am completely bewildered. Everything on the site is free, so price cannot be the reason. There is also no advertising. For me, this site was an important life project, I thought it was the best thing I created, and I wanted to give it to people. But since no one even goes inside, I misunderstood something in this life. Has the format of educational programs become outdated, should I make videos? Does no one study popular science websites for children in their free time? Does no one go to Facebook to find educational content there? Or on the contrary, has such content become so abundant that mine simply drowned in a million similar sites? The result of 17 years of work - zero feedback, I am looking into the abyss, and I don't even have a hint of what's wrong.  \\nIf there is a kind person among you who will tell me what's wrong - I will be immensely grateful. Not to praise, but to criticize. To say - ugly, boring, inappropriate - anything of that sort, if it's true.

Eventually the girl tries to suffocate the kitten in a plastic bag, puts the bag in a sink full of water to drown it, and then pushes a toaster into the sink to electrocute the kitten.

One of my friends was actually not placed in the school they interviewed for, but has still got a regular job at one particular school.

I said they already are my kids, and they asked if I would adopt them. I think they were being half genuine. \\n\\nI have another student in this class who transferred because he had trouble with fighting in his last school. I make a point to let him know that I see how smart he is, and I\\u2019ve given him advice for how to stay out of fights and what he can do instead. Yesterday he came into class late, interrupting me with a hearty \\u201cHi mister!\\u201d But I didn\\u2019t care that he interrupted me because it was funny and sweet. \\n\\nThen one of my favorite students from last year came to class because he had a free period at the end of the day. Normally I don\\u2019t want extra students in my class, but for him I can make an exception. He wrote me a letter last year about how he liked my class (I love when other teachers assign things like that to help boost morale for their colleagues). I showed him what we were working on today and he remembered it. He even asked about other activities from the unit! Most of my students can barely remember what happened on monday, but this kid knows my entire curriculum. And he even started helping my current students with the assignment. We talked about how he\\u2019s going to be taking AP classes next year. \\n\\nAnyway, just glad I have the end of the day to look forward to. \"", "title": "My favorite students", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bdqenw/my_favorite_students/"}, {"author": "Rootin_TootinMoonMan", "created_utc": 1710334964.0, "link_flair_template_id": "b6ee7828-db2e-11ea-a6da-0e1b2b510ecf", "link_flair_text": "New Teacher", "num_comments": 25, "post_id": "1bdqwp3", "score": 29, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"I\\u2019m a first year teacher.

My personality & interests\\n\\nThe whole reason I want to go into education is because, for my whole life, I\\u2019ve loved learning and teaching others about things that I\\u2019m passionate about. I\\u2019ve had lots of teachers who\\u2019ve had a big impact on me (both intellectually and personally) and who have fueled my passion for certain subjects, and I think it would be fun and rewarding to do that for others. I\\u2019d like to think, and I have been told, that I\\u2019m pretty good at helping people understand things.On the flip side, I also know my weaknesses. I\\u2019ve heard the saying that people who were bad students make better teachers than those who were great students because the former know what it\\u2019s like to struggle and have an easier time reaching those kids. If this is true, it would be a point against me because (and I say all this to provide context, not to brag about how gifted and special I am) I\\u2019ve always been a high achiever with high standards for myself. It\\u2019s not like I\\u2019ve \\\\*never\\\\* struggled academically, but I\\u2019ve gotten very good grades for most of my life and have always put a lot of effort into school. I do admit that, because of this, I sometimes find it hard to understand or sympathize with people who I don\\u2019t think try as hard as they should. I get frustrated with my peers at school who don\\u2019t seem to be invested in or taking ownership of their own education; what do you mean you didn\\u2019t feel like doing this assignment or project, so you just didn\\u2019t? How can you complain about your grades when you clearly aren\\u2019t putting in adequate effort? Just try!I know that it\\u2019s not wrong to have standards (and, again, I\\u2019m not just trying to flex my intellectualism\\u2122 to you guys) but I do recognize that it can be damaging to have a teacher with no sympathy for your problems or who decides that you \\u201caren\\u2019t trying.\\u201d I would say that my tendency to be overly logical and critical is my worst personality trait (in that it causes the most strain in my relationships, not necessarily that I wish I didn\\u2019t have it), and while I am trying to work on it, I do kinda worry that it\\u2019s just in my nature and that it would hurt my ability to teach.\\n\\nII.The state of the job\\n\\nIt kinda goes without saying that the sentiment towards teaching online is not positive. I feel like every time I go on Twitter or TikTok, and definitely this sub (sometimes I lurk here to scope things out), I\\u2019m seeing posts like [this](https://x.com/illsingyourname/status/1767678351915745369?s=20) or [this](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTLNJGV4p/) about how kids are worse-behaved and worse-off academically than they\\u2019ve ever been, there\\u2019s no support from admin and parents, the job isn\\u2019t worth the pay and the stress, and so on. Of course, I know that the internet can provide a sorta skewed perspective of things\\u2014people exaggerate sometimes, and people are more likely to post about how much they hate their job than how great it is\\u2014but it doesn\\u2019t fill me with confidence when the replies to every \\u201cshould I be a teacher\\u201d post online are always a resounding no. Plus, I observe a lot of the trends that people talk about myself. The younger kids at my school can be shockingly rude and badly behaved, and I know lots of people my age who lack a lot of what I consider to be common sense and knowledge. Like, I have a friend who doesn\\u2019t know the branches of government or basic world geography, and there are people in my humanities classes who struggle to write a coherent essay or do more than a few pages of assigned reading in a night. Mind you, I go to a private school where most people are pretty well-off and had access to good education. These aren\\u2019t people who\\u2019ve grown up going to underfunded schools who lack resources or opportunities; mostly, they\\u2019re people with all the access, privilege, and support you could ever need who, for whatever reason, just don\\u2019t perform.\\\\* As much as I feel like I\\u2019d enjoy the idea of teaching, I don\\u2019t want to enter a career where I\\u2019ll be miserable. All things considered, do you guys truly, honestly think that the job is worth going into? Do you think conditions for teachers are likely and able to improve, or should I take heed of the signs now?\\n\\nFor added context, I\\u2019m pretty certain I want to major in French and/or linguistics in college, and if I did decide to take that path, I\\u2019d probably want to teach French at a high school level. I\\u2019m also pretty sure I\\u2019d want to go to grad school to get at least a master\\u2019s degree. All things considered, should I pursue this career path? I've read on this sub some, so I'm aware of some of the things people will mention (low pay, low respect, high stress, etc). I do want to hear your perspectives on those things, but I suppose I'm also asking whether I'm right for the job, not just if the job is right for me.

The girl has verbally lashed out at students a few times, usually if they are being too loud or if they are teasing her.  She has never hit anyone.

I am well-paid for a teacher (though in an extremely HCOL), but, this comes with tremendous trade-offs (iykyk). \\n\\nMy workload is completely unsustainable. I work eight days a week, think about almost nothing but work, and swear I am going to quit by the time October. There is no such thing as \\\"working within contract hours\\\" at our school. The grading never ends, and our planning must be perfect. The parents call all the shots--we are mere speedbumps on their child's way to the Ivy League. Then, spring rolls around and my workload lightens slightly, and I trick myself into thinking I can keep going...for the next 35 years. \\n\\nI probably won't make it. I'm too burned out and should change careers, but because of where I live and my unusually high salary for my profession, starting over really would be is going to be tough...

A friend suggested I applied for it thinking that teaching middle school would solve a lot of my problems: 1 prep vs. 3, same lesson 5x/day vs. 3 lessons 1-to-2x per day, more projects and in-class work time (less planning), significantly less grading, lower stakes overall, no college letters of recommendation, no 10-page research papers to grade, etc. \\n\\nI like the \\\"rigor\\\" of teaching high school and I like that I can be myself (to the extent possible) with my students.

I'm not sure I would describe myself as \\\"patient\\\" or as someone who thrives in a chaotic environment, e.g., I hide in the back during pep rallies; I do not sign up to lead any summer camp-type activities with the students.

From regular, to honors, and even some AP classes, most teachers have given up assigning novels. I really hate to continuously be blaming everything on Covid, but it's been a nightmare since then. We used to assign a novel a quarter. Then it turned into one a semester. Then at least one a year. Then it became just excerpts. And now it's nothing. There are thousands of students who have been, are, and will be graduating at my high school that will have gone their entire 9-12 without having read ONE novel.\\n\\nThe problem is that there isn't a way to teach books effectively to them anymore. \\n\\nThey hate whole class reading. They hate solo reading. They won't read at home. They won't listen to the audiobook. They won't read spark note summaries. They won't even watch a film adaptation (and yes, most of those are bad, but these kids won't make it past the opening credits to even decide if a movie is good or not). \\n\\nThere is no such thing as a book that interests them. They can't engage. They just won't do it. The few teachers I know that actually try to teach a novel give up after just a few chapters - if that. It's the elephant in the room no one at my school wants to talk about, but this is just the new normal: novels aren't being taught. \\n\\nIt's like they just *want* to do boring, irrelevant worksheets just to \\\"get the grade\\\" and be done. I don't get it. I really don't. I've done the gambit. I tried everything you could possibly imagine.\\n\\nIt sucks so much because they won't even try to read past the first chapter of anything. I have their attention for *maybe* ten minutes on a good day. In that ten minutes, I'm lucky to get one volunteer to read (most of the time it's me. Kids refuse to read because they claim they have too much anxiety to read out loud). There is *never* any discussion. I'll call on kids and ask questions ranging from basic comprehension questions to things in which should spawn discussion. Nothing. Crickets. Gone are the days of  \\\"read this chapter at home so we can have our Socratic Seminar tomorrow.\\\" Those were great. I would basically just facilitate and watch them discuss whatever text. It was awesome. But now? Zero chance. I cannot get them to answer simple questions. I can't get them to read. I can't get them to listen. I can't get them to understand or anything. My biggest gripe would be the students who would elect to read Sparknotes in lieu of the novel. Now, I'd be happy if they just did that. They can't even be bothered to do that. \\n\\nThe thing is, it's not behavior. My high schoolers are angels. Literally zero behavior issues. It's just what they *want* is to just sit there, be given some random ass worksheet where they can just fill out a few questions while watching YouTube on the side and get their daily grade for showing up or whatever it is that they think school is. \\n\\nI guess that's really where we're at. These kids don't want to learn. They want the grade. I feel like my job is basically retail; everything we do is transactional. \\n\\nI've just given up trying. Read this. Do this assignment (which entails googling an answer), and hopefully do well enough on state tests so I don't have countless paperwork to fill out explaining why my passing rate is low. \\n\\nMan, I miss actually teaching content instead of doing whatever I've been doing the last 3 or so years. It's not teaching.

I've been able to watch several of them grow from smelly, immature 6th graders to confident men and women ready to take on the world.\\n\\nToday, I was heading toward my office near the end of the school day when I spotted one of our seniors sitting on a bench, waiting for practice.  She's been doing full-time dual enrollment at the local community college, and coming to campus only for athletics, so I haven't had the chance to see her much this year.  I taught in her in 6th, 8th, and 10th grades, and worked with her as a coach during a coding competition.

Mr. Cass!!!!  Oh, it's so GOOD to see you!\\\"  She leaped off the table to talk with me, and we spent a good 15 minutes just talking about what to expect at college in the fall.  We've spent many hours over the years talking about that kind of stuff, and since she and I are both the kind of people who would rather be in our room reading than out mingling, I've been able to give her some advice on adapting to college.\\n\\nWe commiserated over Calculus 2; as I have a math degree, she knows that I've gone through that class as well.  We chatted about what she might expect in the dorms; she's excited that she got into the Honors dorm, and will have her own private bathroom instead of a communal one.  (Little jealous of that, I admit.)\\n\\nShe said again that she misses having me as a teacher, as I always made her think about things that she'd never considered before.  (My classes focus heavily on the ethics of technology and how it impacts our society.)  \\n\\nShe had to go to practice eventually, and we parted ways again.

I've also had many of my colleagues talk to me about how other students complain that I don't give any As. \\n\\nIn any other situation, I would reassess my grading to see if I made a mistake. I know I didn't, though, because everything is graded on completion percentage. Students don't show up enough and don't have enough foundational skills for me to grade on anything else. For context, this is Eng 10. Students can't spell at all. They have no concept of punctuation. We've done grammar drills and vocab days, but they're getting it too late for the intervention to be effective, so I've accepted that I need to grade what they give me, not where they should be. So, I grade based on how much they turn in that's related to the assignment. For example, a 10 question assignment with 8 questions done gets an 80%. A 10 question assignment with 8 questions done, but 5 are just random words or do not answer the question (real life example: Q: \\\"What is the theme of \\\"The Raven?\\\"?\\\" A: \\\"A raven is a large, black bird, often found in the northern hemisphere\\\") gets a 30%. Most students live in the 90%-100% completion range and get that grade. The reason so many do not have As is because they only turn in around 50% of the work. They get upset that they have 100%s on multiple assignments but a 60% overall in the class as though the missing assignments don't factor in at all. \\n\\nApproximately 33% of my students have a C- or higher. I am not a hard grader. I give extra time and allow for makeups within reason. Not having an A has nothing to do with me and everything to do with effort. It's honestly so sad to me that I only have 5 As out of 132 students. I wish I could give more, but they are as behind as they are because of teachers who've given them unearned credit.

She is struggling in particular with one class, her CP Global Studies.  Her other classes are all honors, and she works VERY hard and gets As and Bs in those classes.  This year she\\u2019s gotten a low C for the first time, and it\\u2019s in her global studies class.\\n\\nWhen I first asked her about it, she said it was just a hard class, and she said she would work harder.  She\\u2019s not a great test-taker, so she really has to focus on studying and engage in class.  She is an auditory learner.  \\n\\nShe made an offhand comment about another kid in her class, and after a lot of questions I realized she\\u2019s, at least partially, struggling in this class because there is a special needs student in this class who constantly talks over the teacher.  For example, the teacher will be explaining something, the student will get excited and talk over the teacher, explaining as well, for most of the lecture.  The teacher usually ignores him.  She said she doesn\\u2019t hear what the teacher is saying during these periods.  \\n\\nThe child is also in a language and music class with my daughter.  The language class is better as far as her grades, but he has tantrums frequently and meltdowns at least once a month in this class.  The meltdowns are mostly verbal, and mostly non violent, as far as I know, but he has threatened violence towards the other students as a group verbally at least once.  My daughter said she\\u2019s not worried about the threat, but it does stress her out that he is always having these episodes during class.   Her other friends feel similarly to her.  One has even dropped the GS class in part because of this.  \\n\\nShe has no ill-will towards this student.  She said in the past, she has asked him politely if he would stop talking and singing during quiet study times, and he is amenable to that.  Most of the time, though,  she doesn\\u2019t feel like it\\u2019s her place to address the disruption.  This student has good grades in all of the classes he shares with my daughter.  \\n\\nI reached out to her guidance counselor. She said she\\u2019s looking into it and possibly switch where she is sitting.   I\\u2019m worried not much will change.  I\\u2019m not worried about \\u201cwinning\\u201d or punishing the kid, I just don\\u2019t want my daughter to have to struggle. I would appreciate any advice on how to proceed as diplomatically as possible.  \\n\\nFor reference, the school is proud of its academics (one of the highest rated in the state) and half the population of the district is fairly affluent.

It's a great place to work, but there are certainly issues. I'd list them all here, but they're pretty typical for the profession, I think. \\n\\nToday it was the English department's turn in a series of full-day vertical alignment meetings: it is myself and the three MS teachers that share the LA/Reading course-load for 6-8th grade. The principal was supposed to be there (he was at the previous math and science meetings), but informed us that he would be out of district until tomorrow afternoon. \\n\\nWhich...wasn't great. It meant that none of the decisions we made could be vetted by him, and we would essentially have to get the sign off on new curriculum, text sets, course offerings, etc. after the fact. Already, I'm not feeling confident about the meeting, but I rally. The counselor is there to oversee the meeting. \\n\\nWe spend the first hour talking about textbook options, even though no samples have been ordered. We discuss course sequencing and offerings, and we take this opportunity to share the issues we've been seeing and our solutions. We care about kids; we feel strongly about we need in order to do our jobs, but it seemed like we were having a productive, professional conversation about student needs while considering our own mortal limitations.\\n\\nThen, our phones all go off. Here is a transcript of what we received. \\n\\n**Principal:** I just resent the Agenda for today. So sorry, wish I was there. Let me know if you need anything else. \\n\\n**Counselor:** This is just a bitch fest. Giving them a few more minutes then we will move on\\n\\n**Principal:** Let's not do that \\\\*laugh cry emoji\\\\*\\n\\nNow...my first interpretation is that, perhaps, we weren't meant to see that text message. It certainly felt like I wasn't. Nobody mentions the text, and Counselor then leaves us alone for about an hour after that. Coworker sends following message:\\n\\n**Coworker:** Sorry about that. I don't think we meant to be bitchy, just got a little passionate...\\n\\n**Counselor:** lol. We all have to vent. It's good. Great ideas about how to add more ela time! \\n\\nCounselor pops back in for a tense half hour, then leaves to supervise lunch. She finally returns after lunch and apologizes. She says she didn't consider the tone of her message before sending it, and that many of the other meetings had similar concerns to ours. The implication was that she purposefully sent it, but didn't mean for it to be offensive to us. One of the coworkers admitted that morale was certainly low, and that, as a group of female teachers, we didn't appreciate the 'bitchy' moniker. I'll admit I stepped out for a couple minutes during that moment to recollect myself. \\n\\nThe rest of the afternoon continued with us working on personal work, and conversation stayed on pleasant topics without any more conflict, though I'll admit I wasn't very conversational with the counselor and kept my responses to a polite minimum. \\n\\nAm I tripping? I was so horrendously offended by her text message when I saw it, and I immediately felt like her explanation three hours later felt phony and contrived. But...I'll admit that I'm a Sensitive Sally who can overreact. What are your thoughts? \\n\\nTL;DR Counselor sent message to group text calling our meeting a 'bitch fest'.

I just came up with a term in my head to differentiate the students who don't know any English. In years past I could see which students were officially identified as ELL, their current goals regarding developing skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening, and a PAUSE score, which is a measurement for how proficient the student was in using and understanding English. A 0% meant a child with no understanding of English. \\nNow I've got a roster of, like, 10 students who I *know* are, by definition, ELL, but not label as such, and, as a result, not receiving any support. \\n\\nAlso, to me, \\\"illegal\\\" felt like the wrong term, but it is what I hear around me most often, hence why it's in the title. I've also been told \\\"undocumented\\\" is insensitive because it also has a negative, criminal connotation, yet at the time of writing the original post I couldn't think of a better label to separate documented and undocumented migrants when talking about my experience with them. Again, of course, I'm not calling little Carlos \\u201cillegal\\u201d. I call them by their name and friend or amigo.  Sincerest apologies if any of the terms I use come off as offensive, that is never my intention.\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\n\\nIn the past 10 years, I've had very few of what I'm very ignorantly calling \\\"0% ELL students\\\" for a total lack of a better term for students who knew no English at all. Any student that was labeled ELL had *some* understanding of English to the point that I could communicate well enough with them. In my class roster I'd have I'd maybe three students whose parents knew some English that they taught to their children, or maybe knew no Engish but sent their children to classes to learn English and then come back home to teach to their family. The majority of these families were legal citizens or in the process of becoming legal citizens (which the school assisted with), and they had pride in learning English. Hell, the district had a phenomenal ELL program considered one of the best, so much so that *other* towns sent their ELL students here. \\n\\nI took a two year hiatus, and now I've been subbing throughout my district in grades k-12, and ... the population has changed a *lot*.  Each class has at least one (and as many as 10) student(s) who *only* speak Spanish. The ELL program is in shambles, largely in part due to it losing its funding. Many of these families are illegal/undocumented immigrants too, which means their parents \\\"lay low\\\" (again, lack of a better term) and don't sign up for benifits (i.e., students come to school with only one piece of bread for lunch, and student does not have proper clothing, but the family won't sign the paperwork that would give him free lunch, breakfast, snacks, clothes, home internet, a computer, etc.). Nor do they complain when they are wronged (i.e., the family of an assaulted student didn't press for any \\\"justice\\\" because they're terrified of police involvement). Nor can I get any parental/guardian communication (no response from phone calls, letters, or emails (all translated into English and Spanish), very few attempt to communicate with me at drop off/pick up (even with a translator or Google Translate), and, even when I (attempt to) speak Spanish, wether it's for good news (\\\"trabaja bien con sus compa\\u00f1eros de clase en trabajos grupales\\\") or bad news (\\\"\\u00e9l se comport\\u00f3 como un poco amistoso\\\"), I'm met with only \\\"no ingl\\u00e9s\\\"). Similarly, when I attempt to communicate with students, they answer in a string of Spanish I feel terrible for not being able to understand, and when I speak English, they say \\\"no ingl\\u00e9s\\\" and, understandably so, get increasingly more frustrated. When I have other staff and students translate for them I hear a lot of \\\"I won't learn English\\\" and \\\"I don't need to learn English\\\" and \\\"why do I have to learn English if my mama and papa don't know English\\\", with older kids saying the likes of \\\"I'm from Mexico, not America, so don't expect me to learn English\\\" and \\\"I've gone 15 years not learning English, you can't make me learn it now\\\". Now, I understand this as child voicing their frustration with learning a foreign language and not a student swearing off never, ever learning English, but I've had so many teachers tell me don't waste my time of them, they won't ever learn English so don't burn yourself out on one ELL when you have 38 other students to work with, too \\u2026 and I get that, but I'm still having a hard time just giving up in that aspect, you know? \\n\\nIt's a difficult situation for me as a teacher and for the student themselves.

I spend hours translating and practicing the likes of \\\"abra su libro\\\" and \\\"no le pegues y no te lo pongas en la boca\\\" but I'm not good enough. For my big kids, a lot of them just ignore me entirely and lean into the \\\"no ingl\\u00e9s\\\" even when I have Spanish speaking teachers and peers try to talk to them. There's an apathy and disrespect for learning across many of the high school students as a whole, of course, but this language barrier just adds another layer of difficulty.\\n\\nI hope I don't come off as villanizing what boils down to a child who doesn't know the English required to be successful. District wide, teachers are at a loss for how to teach and reach these students, and we haven't been given any guidance. So *so* many teachers just resort to ignoring the students and telling them \\\"I don't understand you\\\" while not even bothering to give these students any class work or assignments. Some of these kids get away with doing nothing but play all day or just sit on their phones, distracting other learners in the process, and teachers around me shrug and say \\\"well, we can't communicate with them anyways, we just need to push them to the next grade\\\" . This all seems so wrong to me, and I'm trying to compensate and serve these students, but I'm struggling so, so, so much. I don't even know where to go from here other than try to teach myself Spanish and crying at night thinking about how I'm failing these students. Do you have any advice for what I can be doing to help these children get the education/services they deserve? \"", "title": "School population is changing \u2014 There are more and more students who are illegal immigrants that do not speak English and I feel so helpless.", "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bdgm8l/school_population_is_changing_there_are_more_and/"}, {"author": "Logical_Ad_9341", "created_utc": 1710124204.0, "link_flair_template_id": "fe0a214e-146a-11e9-893d-0e90c126802c", "link_flair_text": "Teacher Support &/or Advice", "num_comments": 123, "post_id": "1bbsdit", "score": 633, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"No advice needed, just upset and venting. \\n\\nI feel so dirty, gross, and alone.

I\\u2019m having a hard time figuring out what I want to do with my life. I\\u2019m 29 and really would have liked to have a career by now but it is what it is. \\n\\nThis is probably really long so TL;DR at the bottom.\\n\\nI have a bachelor\\u2019s in psych and am currently a \\u201cfull-time\\u201d substitute teacher (I\\u2019m still considered per diem but I work in two large districts with sub shortages so I work every day). I enjoy it but miss some aspects of my last job. \\n\\nSo I worked in the ABA field as a behavior therapist (BT) for about 6 years (basically behavioral therapy with mainly autistic kids). I loved many things about it. I loved the science, the process, the outcomes, etc. I didn\\u2019t expect to love it when I started I just wanted a relevant job in the field while getting my BA. I even started to pursue licensure and got my BCaBA (asst supervisor basically) and worked as a mid-level case manager which I loved even more. Designing my own programs, following up with parents, etc. the only thing I didn\\u2019t love was training new hires and performing monthly fidelity checks with every BT (important to do but not my fav). I even began to pursue masters/licensure. But I burnt out really really hard. \\n\\nThere were a lot of reasons why, and a lot of reasons why I wanted to tough it out but I ended up leaving my company and basically went back to being a full time BT except in school. During this time I came to love the classroom environment but behavioral therapy left such a bitter taste in my mouth so I decided to look into teaching. That was about two years ago now and I\\u2019ve been subbing for about 1.5 years. I enjoy a lot of it and I have been interested in seeking a teaching credential to go full time.\\n\\nBut the past year has been a lot of work figuring out who I am and what I want the rest of my life to look like. And regarding my career I am very interested in teaching but I realized something: I really miss helping people. I miss seeing my clients grow and change. I miss forging relationships with them. Honestly, I even miss managing crisis situations. They are tough and not fun but very rewarding, and honestly, I kinda of crave them in a way, I never WANT them to happen but stepping in and de escalating situations made me feel like\\u2026 idk like I was meant to be doing it? I\\u2019m not sure how to explain but I felt very in my element.\\n\\nI can definitely get some of those from teaching but possibly not to the degree I had before. I\\u2019ve had great moments subbing long term for the same classrooms. I love the creativity of making my own lessons and I love being with a student with learning challenges, because figuring out how to get them to understand and then seeing them do it is sooo rewarding for me. So here\\u2019s my dilemma. \\n\\nBasically I loved ABA but I burned out very hard on it. I like teaching but I am not sure if it\\u2019s exciting enough for me. I\\u2019m interested in other psychology fields or even special ed but I have no experience in the former and the latter has its own issues. \\n\\nSome things I enjoy: I like doing my own thing my own way, I like starting things by the book and finding creative ways to teach/help/solve a problem. But I also very much like collaboration. I like helping people. I like working with kids (big brother syndrome lol). I like a mix of both laid-back and challenging, otherwise too easy I\\u2019m bored, too challenging I burnout. I like forging a (professional) relationship with clients/students. Also, I like when I can be very fun while still being productive. Being too professional all the time is boring to me. \\n\\nThings I don\\u2019t want: too much oversight. Fields where it\\u2019s \\u201cexpected\\u201d of me to overwork. Lack of consistency with clients, hours, schedule (especially schedule that\\u2019s a big reason why working in schools interested me). Having to go back to school that will take more than 2 years at most.\\n\\nTL;DR I\\u2019m subbing in elem schools rn, and I have a psych/ABA background, but I\\u2019m unsure of whether to continue with teaching or go back to psych/behavioral health field.

I am a first year teacher and I am fairly young. I'm 22 and I am the first in my family to go to college and hold a job in this field, so I don't have anyone I can go to for advice. \\n \\nMy school is very divided and the environment seems toxic. I can't say much because I don't know much. I honestly keep away from it and just eat in my room etc. I am friendly with everyone I see, but I never stop to chat with anyone other than a hi, good morning, how are you etc. No one has been outly rude, but no one has made the effort to get to know me and the times I tried, I felt like I was bothering them so I've learned to keep my distance and just exchange pleasantries. \\n\\nAnyways, my site has an inclusion program where students with ieps/504s are pushed into a gen ed class. I have 12 student with high special needs and to say I am overwhelmed is an understatement. I do have a para in the room, but I still walk in eggshells around kids that are easily triggered. There is a specialist on campus but I get minimum support. \\n\\nThe incident / A few months ago I took my kids to the media room and the media teacher realized the high amount of kids with special needs and asked how I was managing. I made the mistake of over sharing and telling the teacher I was extremely overwhelmed and walking on eggshells around some of the students who are easily triggered. I did say that I did not understand why they would give a first year teacher a class with such high needs. My big mistake. This media teacher reached out to the specialist and asked if I was being supported. The specialist took this extremely wrong and forwarded that email to me. The email did not say anything rude, it was actually a very well written email and a kind gesture. But the specialist said \\\"this is coming from you? What's going on?\\\" I understand the concern should have came from me and not the media teacher. Second mistake. Anyways, it sounds like the media teacher and the specialist had an ill encounter (I do not know what happened other than what the specialist shared) the specialist pulled me into their office and said they had had an encounter with the media teacher and they wanted to know who that concern was coming from. The interaction was so tense and honestly I felt like crying bc I felt attacked. I froze and didn't know how to say that really all I was saying was that I felt lost and didn't know what I was doing, but they took it like I was saying they weren't doing their job. Which is not true. Since then, our interactions have been extremely awkward. \\n\\nFast forward, a particular student in that class continued having major behavior issues that disrupted the class. I reached out to the specialist for support and she held a meeting in which she said that the student only has issues in my class and no other teacher really complains. This isn't true because I've seen the student out of their other classes multiple times. Anyways the key word here is \\\"complains\\\" I feel like this specialist took this extremely personal and took this situation as a complaint. I eventually stopped reaching out when I needed support.\\n\\nThe para became a little frustrated with the student as well and he then began reaching out to the specialist. I don't think the specialist likes this particular para very much based on the interactions I've seen. But again, I try not to get involved. The para was out for a few days and I've since had a sub that is really good with the particular student. Now when the para returned, they were  asked to switch out of my class. The para took this personal and went to admin. The para said they felt like they were being switched bc they spoke out about the behaviors of the student and the specialist not agreeing. \\n\\nI am so so worried I will be dragged into this. The last thing I want is any confrontation or to be seen like I don't want to accommodate these students. I do struggle with them, and I really don't feel prepared to teach kids with their needs, BUT they are in my class and I will continue to try to do my best for them. For reference I teach 7th grade history. If I am approached by admin about the situation, how do you recommended I respond? I do feel like I cannot go to the specialist for support anymore and I do feel like they  see me in a negative light. Is this something to bring up if approached? \\n\\nThank you for reading! \"", "title": "Tension with another staff member / Advice?

I don\\u2019t want to do something that contradicts how she is learning math either.  Do I find worksheets for her? Games?

Since the change, the answer on Friday in ELA lab has been \\u201cFun Friday.\\u201d Cool. No problem. So\\u2026reading games? Nope. Uno and other card games. \\n\\nSo 20% of his remedial class time is Uno. Am I wrong to find this maddening? \\n\\nHe failed his ELA midterm. Since he\\u2019s 12 I\\u2019m trying to get him to take some ownership of his education so I asked him to ask his ELA teacher for activities we could do at home to help improve it. He did. He reported that she said something to the effect of \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry about it. I\\u2019ll get you there.\\u201d I was looking for something specific and actionable. \\n\\nFinally, he\\u2019s been invited to participate in an after school test prep session twice a week for 4 weeks in preparation for the end of year state test. This is something done by the whole ELA staff. Normally I\\u2019d be thrilled to have the extra help, but I can\\u2019t help but think that this wouldn\\u2019t be necessary if they spent their class time on class work. \\n\\nSo what should I do here? We do read every day. I read to him. He reads to me. He reads quietly. I put fun books in the bathroom and don\\u2019t allow screens there. I know he reads them because he shares random facts he learns. I don\\u2019t really know what to do at home beyond that and I was hoping for that kind of guidance when he failed his midterm. Is there a home phonics program that would be helpful for him?\\n\\nOn the school front: should I contact them about the fun Friday stuff? Should I let it go and just try to pick up the slack at home? My instinct is to contact the substitute ELA lab teacher directly.\\n\\nObviously I\\u2019m going to have him do the after school thing even though it quietly annoys me. \\n\\nAnything else?\\n\\nThanks so much for taking the time to help with this.  \"", "title": "Help me navigate this please?", "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bc9zvz/help_me_navigate_this_please/"}, {"author": "brishi0014", "created_utc": 1710202141.0, "link_flair_template_id": "11647d48-146b-11e9-8a20-0e7bce180cb8", "link_flair_text": "Career & Interview Advice", "num_comments": 2, "post_id": "1bciywy", "score": 1, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"I\\u2019ve been at my school for 7 years. 4th for 3 years, moved to 3rd for one year due to numbers, and 4th for 3 more.

I was drawn to this SCITT course as it offers time abroad in some schools that teach IB but I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m taking an excessively roundabout way and there\\u2019s a more direct route to becoming an IB teacher? In the UK we also have to do Early Career Teaching (ECT) for two years after receiving our QTS but I would like to go straight to an IB school if that is at all possible. Right now though it\\u2019s just looking like I need to start as an A-level school teacher and then transition which seems like a lot of steps, is there a more direct route that I\\u2019m missing?\\n\\nTL;DR: currently have my English BA, where do I go from here to become IBDP English LAL teacher?\"", "title": "Becoming an IBDP teacher?", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bceade/becoming_an_ibdp_teacher/"}, {"author": "Arbitrary-Fairy-777", "created_utc": 1710221215.0, "link_flair_template_id": "3e476a5c-db64-11ea-a983-0ee7daf6e7e9", "link_flair_text": "Student or Parent", "num_comments": 10, "post_id": "1bcpihn", "score": 0, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"To preface, I'm a comp sci student, so I mainly have experience with using ChatGPT as a debugging and learning tool. Before people lecture me in the comments, I don't use it to write my code for me, or to write my essays (I actually like writing essays).\\n\\nPersonally, I tend to turn to ChatGPT when my code isn't working and I just can't see why. Usually, there's faulty logic somewhere that ChatGPT can see while my tired brain can't. Of course, other times, I have to type back, \\\"No, that's not how pointers work in C. This is how they work.\\\" In my experience, ChatGPT is in no way a replacement for learning material, because you have to know the material in order to assess ChatGPT's responses for effectiveness. When it suggests a way to fix my code, I can evaluate the logic myself or modify my program and try some test cases to see if it works.\\n\\nThe other big thing I use it for is helping me with syntax, because syntax is very formulaic so it's hard for ChatGPT to mess up. Specifically, I like to give it code in a language I know and ask it to help me convert it to another language I'm not as familiar with.\\n\\nI also will sometimes take an example from my textbook or from my class notes and ask ChatGPT to explain part of it to me. Is it lazy? Yes, but it can help me wrap my head around something in a pinch!\\n\\nAll of that is to say, I think ChatGPT is a really neat tool. I do undergrad research in AI/ML, so I'm probably biased towards the benefits of AI, but I also know its limitations (especially when it straight up lies to me about computer science).

In one case, an entire grade level decided to leave the school.\\n\\nThe dean of students is also new this year, and was a principal in another district before coming to us.

We know that she has lied because 2 of our former principals are now up at the district level, one of whom is involved in new principal mentoring and has told us straight up that the new principal was told the exact opposite of what she is telling us.  In one case, she told the SPED team that she had called all the other principals in the district and asked them if they let the team cancel services 1 week a quarter to do their required progress monitoring of student IEP goals, then came back and said that every other principal said that was ridiculous and they never let their SPED team do that.  I've been at other schools in the district and this is the ONLY way I have ever seen it done.  When else are they supposed to PM?  \\n* Mandated lesson plan formats.  Previously, we have always been required to turn in weekly lesson plans, but were free to use whatever format we thought appropriate as long as it had several areas that had to be included.  Now, she is saying that Planbook, which many of us use, is too complicated and doesn't make sense, so she has created her own template we have to use.  (Spoiler alert: hers is terrible.) She also says that anyone who uses Planbook is only using it to copy lessons from previous years so that we don't have to do lesson planning this year, and are turning in lesson plans only as a compliance piece.  (Well, duh...you think I would be turning in lesson plans if I didn't have to, regardless of format? I know what I am teaching, and no, I am not going to sit and flip through my lesson plans section by section as I teach so that I leave dead space in the lesson and let the kids get ansty.  Also, why is it only Planbook users that she has accused of this?  I definitely know that both of my teammates who don't use Planbook have just been recycling lessons from last year.  This is my first year at this grade level and the lesson plans they are giving me to help me plan are the ones from last year that they just change the date on.)\\n* Let behaviors and office referrals run rampant and more or less unchecked.  In one case, we had a student physically attacking his 3rd grade teacher every day and it took her 6 months to get the kid placed in an appropriate setting.  We have 6th graders cussing out their teachers on the daily.  One teacher decided that instead of waiting until the end of the year to retire after his 30 years, he was leaving on the first day he was able, and not finishing the school year.\\n\\nI get giving grace, especially when someone is learning to do the job, but she has turned our very close, tight knit school community into a place where most of us dread coming in every day.\\n\\nHow can I/we approach her and tell her that while she is free to do whatever she thinks necessary, it is causing morale to sink through the floor AND is directly responsible for the outflux of staff?  I'm not trying to cause issues, but I'm at the point where I am wondering if it's even worth fighting to save the school community that we have been building for the past 15 years.  Do we go to her mentor and tell her about all the stuff?  (It might help to know that her mentor was a teacher at this school before becoming a principal at another school in the district.)  Do we go to our area superintendent and voice our concerns?  Should we talk to the 2 previous principals who moved to the district level and say something?\\n\\nI'm sitting here on hour 4 of lesson planning, with no end in sight because of her lesson plan format.  Previously, lesson plans would have taken an hour or so while I pulled up last years lessons and made adjustments for this years kids.  I don't know how many more weeks of this I can take, but I guarantee it's not the 10 weeks until the end of the school year.\\n\\n \"", "title": "How to Reach a New Principal", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bbfhu0/how_to_reach_a_new_principal/"}, {"author": "lastparty87", "created_utc": 1710115440.0, "link_flair_template_id": "fe0a214e-146a-11e9-893d-0e90c126802c", "link_flair_text": "Teacher Support &/or Advice", "num_comments": 5, "post_id": "1bbpau9", "score": 3, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"My violin instructor is a teacher.

I am in school in Ontario, Canada and am in the Intermediate / Senior stream to teach History and English. My first AT was a woman who taught a 7/8 split class, who had been teaching for around 4-5 years and started right before COVID. She was lovely, and taught completely opposite subjects to what I teach, but over all the experience was a learning curve. I felt like I had a routine and a purpose with her, she pushed me out of my comfort zone and asked specific things of me to give me a role (doing attendance after a few days to learn names, let me lead some routines, etc). While I enjoyed this experience I always envisioned myself teaching high school, so I was really looking forward to this placement. \\n\\nThe second I met my associate teacher this semester I knew it was going to be a slight challenge. He\\u2019s around 2-3 years older than me and has been teaching for around a year and a half. He teaches Grade 10 and 12 English and he gets all of his resources from other English teachers in the faculty\\u2026 he doesn\\u2019t know any of the materials he teaches. When he asked if I preferred to teach English or History, and I said History, he seemed disappointed. He gives me no role to participate in the class. While I am supposed to be observing during these first few days, I feel like that is all I do. When he does readings and discussions in his classes, I will try to chime in to add dialogue or help students with their thinking in group discussions, and he will look at me and completely ignore me when I speak. This has happened on two occasions and it is so embarrassing.  The students pick up on the fact that he ignores me, so they ignore me too when I talk to them. Any time he leaves the class quickly to grab something like printing, he will say \\u201c ___ (student) is in charge, ask them if you need anything\\u201d and all the students look at me like wtf is she here for then? It makes me feel so useless.\\n\\nHe told me he wanted to get me access to his materials and the online network to see students work and the lessons, be able to do attendance (it is called D2L in Ontario)\\u2026 this was over a month ago and I ask him consistently the progress on getting me that information and he says he asked me principal once on my first day (February 5) and hasn\\u2019t heard anything back, meanwhile my other peers who are student teaching at this school already have all this access. On my first day at the school, another associateteacher gave me a tour of the school and introduced me to the principal because he didn\\u2019t want to do it. \\n\\nIt gives me so much anxiety because I have no role in this classroom and in about 2 weeks I will be teaching full time. The students don\\u2019t know me (even though every time I have a placement day I walk around and try to talk to the students and see if they need help with their work, they just say no, and I would too if I were them, I have no rapport with these students because he has given me no active role when I am with them.. he gives me no feedback on what I should be working on or what I am doing well). He is responsible for me passing this placement and he hasn\\u2019t helped me whatsoever. I even asked him how important a principal reference is from my practicum, and he said it is super important and it helped him get a full time job\\u2026 when I asked him how I would go about getting a reference he said \\u201cjust talk to them\\u201d\\u2026 yeah that\\u2019s amazing advice! Another golden nugget from him was asking how he handles classroom management: he said he commands a classroom well because he\\u2019s an over 6ft male with tattoos, and I would have a hard time because I\\u2019m a woman and I\\u2019m really short. He literally said students respect him more because he is a man and he\\u2019s tall. \\n\\nI need advice on how to navigate this practicum. I dread it every day and it\\u2019s getting closer and closer. I love the high school environment, the classes, and I can envision myself doing this, by myself. But he has given me nothing. He gives me no jobs, no role, no feedback or advice. He actively asks ME for feedback on his lessons and how he teaches. \\n\\nHow do I build relationships with these students (i have 4 more full days with them until I am \\u201cteaching\\u201d)? How do I get a reference from a principal when my associate teacher expects me to just walk into his office and ask him for a reference (literally his words).

She can\\u2019t record the admins dismissing her because of what the ISD has officially stated about recording conversations with ***specifically administration***.

Over the summer, I wanted to practice my classroom management styles and make some money to help pay for my final year of uni. I managed to pick up a daycare job in my hometown that was willing to give me $12 an hour as a start because of my experience thanks to my uni\\u2019s education program. I fell in love with the students, and had multiple praises from parents because I was the first teacher to actually work with them. The parents and myself were working together with them trying to change the inappropriate behaviors before starting kindergarten. \\nWell, let\\u2019s just say that\\u2019s, unfortunately, going to be my downfall. \\n\\nI was working with 4-5years olds (most of them were about to start going to kindergarten), this will be important as I explain further more. \\n\\nThe daycare is in an old church, so the classrooms had to be split up on the same floor. The older students (6-10 years) were placed in the same area as my students, but kept them divided with a piece a tape on the floor. Yeah I know, not very effective, but the director never wanted to change it. I tried fighting it before, but it was a loosing battle. \\n\\nOf course there were some moments where the students moved in their wrong area, but I did not mind as long they are nice to the littles. Most of the time, I never had an issue with the older children, but there was one student that I was always concerned with, let\\u2019s call him Sonic (trust me it\\u2019ll make sense). \\nSonic was the cutest little child and was a social butterfly. Also, their mother also worked at the daycare, but she was mostly involved with the infants, this will be important. \\nI have to add that we went to same high school in my hometown, she was a grade above me, so we\\u2019ve known each other for a while.  We were in the same classes and clubs. I never had a problem with her, or at least I thought. \\n\\nBefore I start to get side track. \\n\\nIt\\u2019s now been over a month or two that I\\u2019ve been working at the daycare and my students were starting to get used to my routines and my teaching style. Since the older students are in the same area as me, their parents were starting to take notice and wanted to see if I can add their child into my area. \\nThis usually won\\u2019t happen because of the rules the daycare has a about adding older children to the younger students, but they had to make an expectation due to their situation. \\n\\nThe parents always brought up that their child is getting bullied/picked on by Sonic and sometimes it\\u2019ll be physical. This is true because I had personal seen it happened (there was one time that Sonic grabbed the back of another student\\u2019s neck and slammed it on the metal door knock, blocked the bathroom door using their body and trapping students in there, getting too \\u2018handy\\u2019 with the younger female students; even commenting about a female\\u2019s breasts, and would throw wood chips/toys, cussing them out, etc\\u2026). \\nI started to become nervous because these behaviors were concerning, the children were actually starting to get afraid of Sonic and would stay with me just to stay away from them. I tried to make sure I paid very close attention to Sonic and will take him them them to the office, write them up, take away privileges went they were doing these inappropriate behaviors. \\nWell I think their mother was starting to get upset with all the managements I\\u2019ve been doing to Sonic. Of course, he did not like that I was not changing my mind about timeouts and taking way privileges (I know because the other teachers just let him do whatever he wanted) \\nYes the mother has been told about all of things they have done but she just says \\u201cThey\\u2019re having a lot of energy and just needs to let it out.\\u201d And I\\u2019m pretty sure y\\u2019all know the rest of that. \\n\\nWell now let\\u2019s get to the main issue, I was doing a fun science lesson on why it is important to wash our hands and I was called to go to the infant room to talk to Sonic\\u2019s mother because she wanted to address something important. I got hopeful because maybe she is realizing that this is a serious issue and we need to come up with a game plan, well I was terribly wrong. She brought that sonic was having trouble sleeping because of nightmares about sonic.exe. \\n\\nFor those who don\\u2019t know, this is a creepypasta story about the video game character and even has their own computer game and it\\u2019s horrifying, I personal played it and still scared of it to this day. This game is not for younger children!\\n\\nWell Sonic brought up that I was showing this to everyone in the classroom because I love seeing them scared and use it as a punishment, especially with him. He told her that one of the older students showed me this on YouTube and thought this was the \\u201cperfect\\u201d way to punish him. \\nMy jaw dropped on the floor and literally had no words to say because I was absolutely speechless. Yes I had Sonic on but it\\u2019s was that show on Netflix and movement break videos, never sonic.exe. The older students  even wanted to watch it one time because a friend at school told them about it. Well, I said no because it was too scary and I was even scared of it. \\n\\nFast forward, my boss was blaming me for all of this and never let me and never let me let me explain my side of the story. She even took the TV away from my side and placed it with the older students (don\\u2019t ask why it was her idea). \\n\\nDuring my lunch break I was crying my eyes out and had my mother and my fianc\\u00e9 on the phone.  I wasn\\u2019t sure why I was being accused of these things. I was told over and over by my boss about the positive feedback from parents and everything! When I returned from my break, no one would look at me, since the mother was telling them how terrible I was and traumatized their child. (Remember it\\u2019s in a old church, so it echos a lot in this building) I\\u2019m not too sure if they wanted me to listen to it or not. \\n\\nThat was the final straw for me, the next day I sent an email to my boss saying that this is an immediate final notice and mail my my final check to my home. \\n\\nI\\u2019m studying to be a teacher and I cannot have lies ruin my passion even when I haven\\u2019t step into my own elementary classroom. Not a day goes by that I\\u2019m not missing my students, I even tried to get together with another coworker to send them personalized letter but they never got back to me. \\n\\nI\\u2019m also so scared about what could happen next when I\\u2019m not there. I really want to do something about it but I am not sure what to do, so I decided to come ask veteran teachers and see if you all have anything because I want to make sure that those students are in a safe environment. \\n\\nIs there anything that I can do? \\n\\nThank you to the ones who read this far if I miss anything I\\u2019ll make sure to add it later on.\"", "title": "I need some advice: Student Teacher", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bbdxis/i_need_some_advice_student_teacher/"}, {"author": "PossibleLocation3626", "created_utc": 1710086195.0, "link_flair_template_id": "fe0a214e-146a-11e9-893d-0e90c126802c", "link_flair_text": "Teacher Support &/or Advice", "num_comments": 13, "post_id": "1bbdlgb", "score": 1, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"I really need to pick up a part time job on the weekends to make some extra money.

I couldn't handle it. I spent my whole life wanting to be a teacher, only for it to destroy my mental health. I had no backups because I thought I would have a long teaching career (and for many, teaching IS the backup). I am in an amazing position to stay with my parents while I finish graduate school, and I count my blessings to have been able to do this. I am also proud to say I will be graduating this May. Here's the problem: I am earning an M.Ed. in Early Childhood Education. I chose this degree path in 2022, before I had officially decided to leave the profession, and at the urging of my parents who wanted me to take advantage of GI Bill benefits before I turned 26. I don't regret this, because my education is covered, but I wish I had more time to figure out what I wanted to do so I could pursue a more lucrative degree. Education was the only field that interested me at the time, and I planned to open a preschool or at-home childcare facility (I still might!) I chose ECE because I know how important those formative years are for building knowledge, and in my teaching experience, I've noticed a large disparity in the quality of education within my county. Ultimately my professional goal was/is to advocate for ECE equality, be the driving force for change--oh, the idealism of a newly-developed prefrontal cortex. I would like to do this without working directly with small children in a classroom. Throughout this program, I have learned that while I generally like ECE, I am terrified of being alone in a room with 12 toddlers.\\n\\nOther career options are:\\n\\nCorporate Training--I am a very engaging public speaker, and I have many transferrable skills from teaching. I haven't gotten any interviews or offers yet, but I haven't exactly been applying at maximum efficiency, nor is my resume up to par, in my opinion.\\n\\nExecutive Assistant or Legal Assistant-- My sister works in legal field, and administrative work in a quiet office sounds like a dream.\\n\\nCopywriter/Copy Editor-- I'll be honest, after a year of research, I still don't know what copywriters do. All I know is that I love to write and would be willing to write and research any prompt. I thought my passion for writing would be quenched by teaching, but the absurd \\\"literacy\\\" programs sweeping the nation sucked the fun out of that.\\n\\nLiterary Agent at Publishing Company--This is sorta my lofty one because I imagine just reading manuscripts and passing along the good ones.

I was young and unconfident, I took things personally, I wasn't organized, and I didn't set clear and high expectations, which led to behavior issues and many mistakes on my end. While I am still young, I have matured and I know what I would do differently now. However, I made such a big stink about leaving the profession, that I'll feel pretty embarrassed this fall walking into the school with my tail between my legs because I couldn't get hired outside of education.\\n\\nI feel I have unfinished business with teaching.

In effort to stay in my Admin\\u2019s good graces, I let my husband do drop offs for the rest of this year. Which isn\\u2019t ideal for his schedule, it worked better when we switched turns. \\n\\nHere are my options for next year:\\n\\n#1 -Keep my sort of cushy current position Teacher. Making $57k. Have Aug/Sept off for maternity leave. Just be annoyed that I am micromanaged about my in time and can never drop my child off at Kinder this coming year. \\n\\n#2- Take a position across the border, where I actually live, making $8k more per year. Unclear what the mat leave would be. So likely just FMLA for a few weeks. Would be able to drop child at Kinder and pickup. \\n\\n#3- Take a position at my child\\u2019s small private schools. Pay cut $6k. But be able to do drop offs/pick ups as we would be on the same campus. \\n\\n\\nIf you are an older Mom and have any wisdom to share with me, please do. The mom guilt is eating me alive. I already feel awful for going back to work a few months after baby #2 is born. I was fortunate enough to take 2.5 years off with my first child. Am I putting too big of a priority of being involved in dropping my child off at school? Or even considering teaching on the same campus? Or is this my gut telling me what is right for my family? Hiring someone to do drop off has also crossed my mind. But it\\u2019s just like WHY can\\u2019t work life and Mom duties coexist? \\ud83d\\ude24\"", "title": "What would you do?", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1baymjj/what_would_you_do/"}, {"author": "ermonda", "created_utc": 1710014167.0, "link_flair_template_id": "fe0a214e-146a-11e9-893d-0e90c126802c", "link_flair_text": "Teacher Support &/or Advice", "num_comments": 14, "post_id": "1baqjm7", "score": 3, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"I don\\u2019t think I am the asshole but I\\u2019m curious what other TEACHERS think and what you do about taking ALL your students on a field trip.\\n\\nI teach first grade. I have a student who was mostly okay for the first 5 months of school. He had an occasional outburst here and there and would refused to go to music class a few times but he was fairly easy to talk down and redirect. He was suspended for punching a kid at recess once and when his mom was called about it she came to school screaming and yelling, got in one of the counselor\\u2019s face and tried to start a fight. After that mom was no longer allowed past the front office.\\n\\nAnyway, this kid wasn\\u2019t great but he wasn\\u2019t that horrible either. Then in January his mom had her SIXTH baby and he has completely spiraled out of control since. He gets furious and starts screaming at students just for looking at him. He gets so angry if he runs out of time to finish his work (often bc he spent the first half of class angry about something else and didn\\u2019t start on time) even though he is told he can finish after lunch. Then he will be escorted to lunch by admin but will refuse to eat for the first 15 minutes and then have a full temper tantrum when lunch is over and he didn\\u2019t finish eating. He spends a lot of the day raging about things he can\\u2019t control and tries to manipulate ppl to get as much control as possible then gets really mad when his plan didn\\u2019t work. Fortunately, admin is supportive and I can easily send him out for them to deal with if needed.\\n\\nSo we have a field trip coming up and I told admin I absolutely refuse to be responsible for this kid in public. Obviously we can\\u2019t ask his mom to come. I told admin they can keep him back at school or send a school staff member who understands that they are 100% responsible for him on the trip and not to look for me to help if he starts screaming at ppl bc I\\u2019m not dealing with that bullshit in public. \\n\\nSo what do you all do with unpredictable students who lose their shit consistently on field trips? I know some states actually have laws where you can\\u2019t exclude kids from field trips so I\\u2019m sure many of you have dealt with this. \"", "title": "AITA if I refuse to deal with a certain student on a field trip?", "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1baqjm7/aita_if_i_refuse_to_deal_with_a_certain_student/"}]
