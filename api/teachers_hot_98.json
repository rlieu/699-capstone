But I need to process and unload with people who understand. I was out with my college age daughter today and had to stop at dr office that happens to be in a horrible part of town. She wants Starbucks but then remembers the dive burger place nearby. I jokingly told her, \\u201csure let\\u2019s get a burger and maybe shot today. I\\u2019m game!\\u201d And that is where some divine intervention happened. We go in and there is a homeless man that was so pitiful looking and smelling. Took my breath away. I also got that energy that something bad may go down. Then I\\u2019m telling myself to stop. But he was strung out on something. He keeps trying to get my attention. He finally makes eye contact and I said hi to him. Then\\u2026 he says to me \\u201cyou were my teacher, do you remember me?\\u201d I did! Couldn\\u2019t remember name because I\\u2019m 54 and been at this for over 3 decades. I had him in first grade and my daughter was one year ahead at same school. So we talk and bless him he was struggling. He is homeless and just got out of drug and mental rehab. At this point I\\u2019m just sick to my stomach. He walks outside and I ask the workers if he was causing any issues and if he had eaten. No, to both. So I go outside and ask him if I could buy his lunch. Next thing you know he is showing me his belongings and that is all he had. Sadly, some drugs were given to him by someone. He showed me he had no tracks on arms and I saw no needles. I went into teacher/mom mode and he told me what the pill number was. I told him he can\\u2019t be using meds someone on Street gave him. He showed me other things he had dug from trash cans. I then talked to him about a contact I have with homeless services in town. But he said he would rather be on streets. That\\u2019s when it hit me he was truly on something. I also found a kit that someone from an agency gave him to clean himself. I really just wanted to fix him right there but knew this is way bigger than the bandaid I had. So I took him inside the place and ordered him a meal and told him he had to be nice and respectful to everyone there. He thanked me over and over and then hugged me. I told him to be safe and take care of himself and find a safe place on the streets to sleep. I also told him to consider a shelter. When I walked away, kids sitting at another table asked who I was. As I was getting in my car I look up and he says, \\u201cthat was my first grade teacher.\\u201d He also had a huge smile on his face. I waved to him and told my daughter I was going to lose it when we pulled away. I ended up driving around the block a couple of times. My daughter said I did everything I could for him and not to feel guilty. But damn, he is only 19 and has been homeless awhile. It just sucks he was born into a shitty environment and was not able to climb out of it. But I always tell my kids on the last day of school they will always be one of my kids. So today, he is still my kid. And I got his belly full and he smiled. Hopefully when he lays down tonight he remembers I still care. Now I\\u2019m crying and just wish I could have done more.

It's horrifying but it does not surprise me.\\n\\nI teach high school. Age range 15-18 years old. I have seen students who can't do the following:\\n\\n* Read at grade level. Some come into my classroom at a 3rd/4th grade reading level. There are some students who cannot sound out words.\\n* Write a complete sentence. They don't capitalize the first letter of the sentence or the I's. They also don't add punctuation. I have seen a student write one whole page essay without a period.\\n* Spell simple words.\\n* Add or subtract double-digits. For example, they can't solve 27-13 in their head. They also cannot do it on paper. They need a calculator.\\n* Know their multiplication tables.\\n* Round\\n* Graph\\n* Understand the concept of negative.\\n* Understand percentages.\\n* Solve one-step variable equations. For example, if I tell them \\\"2x = 8. Solve for x,\\\" they can't solve it. They would subtract by 2 on both sides instead of dividing by 2.\\n* Take notes.\\n* Follow an example. They have a hard time transferring the patterns that they see in an example to a new problem.\\n* No research skills. The phrases they use to google are too vague when they search for information. For example, if I ask them to research the 5 types of chemical reactions, they only type in \\\"reactions\\\" in Google. When I explain that Google cannot read minds and they have to be very specific with their wording, they just stare at me confused. But even if their search phrases are good, they do not click on the links. They just read the excerpt Google provided them. If the answer is not in the excerpts, they give up.\\n* Just because they know how to use their phones does not mean they know how to use a computer. They are not familiar with common keyboard shortcuts. They also cannot type properly. Some students type using their index fingers.\\n\\nThese are just some things I can name at the top of my head. I'm sure there are a few that I missed here.\\n\\nNow, as a teacher, I try my best to fill in the gaps. **But I want the general public to understand that when the gap list is this big, it is nearly impossible to teach my curriculum efficiently.** This is part of the reason why teachers are quitting in droves. You ask teachers to do the impossible and then vilify them for not achieving it. You cannot expect us to teach our curriculum efficiently when students are grade levels behind. Without a good foundation, students cannot learn more complex concepts. I thought this was common sense, but I guess it is not (based on admin's expectations and school policies).\\n\\n***I want to add that there are high-performing students out there. However, from my experience, the gap between the \\\"gifted/honors\\\" population and the \\\"general\\\" population has widened significantly.

I have heard Facebook-spread talking points like \\\"It has a 99% survival rate\\\" or \\\"It's been around since last October. We have all probably had it already!\\\"\\n\\nI get that skepticism is alright. It's a good characteristic to have, but in the absence of any real evidence to support a claim...you should not be spreading misinformation and basing decisions off of that. A lack of evidence goes against the very crux of scientific investigation.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo if you are a science teacher and you spread this kind of crap I truly believe you need to leave. **YOU** are the problem with science education in the United States \\\\[and the world\\\\].\\n\\nAs a science teacher I look at the data and think \\\"That doesn't look great. Maybe schools should stay closed to students and we go virtual,\\\" or I just look at what the experts are saying. Because I am not an epidemiologist. But the way some of my colleagues talk you'd think they have their PhD's on the subject.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nGet out of science teaching and go be a Feng Shui expert. Spread your charlatanism elsewhere.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: 22 hours later....\\n\\nI wanted to address a few things here.\\n\\nFirst, the \\\"you must not be a scientist\\\" remarks--what exactly is unscientific about what I typed here? I specifically stated that I don't know the answer. I am not an expert on everything...no one is an expert on everything. You have to defer to other people that are. If you are a Physicist that wants to build a new kind of bridge then you will have to either go through years of school to become an engineer or you can find one and get their opinion on its structural soundness and utility.\\n\\nSecond, several times people think they are \\\"catching me\\\" because I state (in some replies) that the CDC put out the IRD (infectious rate of death) to be 0.65%. And so the 99% argument must be a valid one because I am saying it's actually 99.35%! Well, the difference between typing this over reddit and saying it in person is vast. Over reddit, I can at least assume that people understand what that means in terms of number of people dead. In person this is never put into context...you just use it as a point of contention and coldly move on. You use it to be intentionally misleading. 0.65% of 309,000,000 is not a small number let alone the population of the entire globe. And neither is 1% for that matter...\\n\\nThirdly, back to the \\\"scientists are curious\\\" remarks. And I must not be a scientist because I'm not curious or unwilling to be skeptical. I stated that skepticism is alright, but in the absence of real evidence to support a claim you should not be spreading misinformation. I state multiple times throughout replies that there is possibly something fishy going on with the numbers, but **I DONT KNOW** so I won't jump to any conclusions. It's like looking up and seeing an airplane configuration that you've never seen before and immediately jumping to \\\"That must have been aliens!\\\" even though that's obviously a silly thing to conclude without any evidence other than not knowing what it was.\\n\\nFinally, I want to be clear that this economic shutdown was a shit-show and I know. Of course I played no role in it. When I saw the numbers in Italy back in March it was *scary*. When the WHO was releasing conflicting information I scoffed at them and thought \\\"What the fuck is wrong with them?\\\" And then Trump started talking about Covid-19 never being a problem here and then injecting sunlight into our veins (??). And then the entire governmental structure seemingly failing to handle this thing properly. There's a difference between being skeptical of what is going on based on real, tangible evidence and being skeptical based on your political standing which is going to color your skepticism and deceive you.\\n\\nI hope that in 6 months time this is all behind us. That we have a vaccine that is being mass produced and everyone (including our black neighbors, our overweight/obese neighbors, our elderly neighbors, our neighbors with cancer, etc.) can start to feel safer going out into the world. I'm prepared for things to completely turn around because I'm not really taking a stance here. Do I think it will happen based on trends? No...not *quickly*, but I'm sure we will eventually be back to \\\"normal\\\" and look back at this clusterfuck and hopefully learn from it.\"", "title": "If you teach science and think Covid-19 is a \"hoax\" then please resign", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/i1t0ka/if_you_teach_science_and_think_covid19_is_a_hoax/"}, {"author": "ShirleyMcLoon", "created_utc": 1702256964.0, "link_flair_template_id": "fe0a214e-146a-11e9-893d-0e90c126802c", "link_flair_text": "Teacher Support &/or Advice", "num_comments": 806, "post_id": "18fijuw", "score": 11483, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"My student was killed in a car accident yesterday.

Every time I have to redirect a student, for any behavior, I add a tally next to their name. 5 tallies in one class = parent notification and office referral. At the end of every class, I put the total number of class tallies in a chart and at the end of every month the class with the fewest tallies will get a big prize (not bullshit school prizes they don\\u2019t care about). I\\u2019m talking chick fil a catered lunch, Dunkin\\u2019 Donuts\\u2026stuff they actually want. My students have started holding each other accountable because they really don\\u2019t want tallies.

The good students in every class have always been rewarded for their behavior through incentives in my class as well as school-wide ones.

While we all differed on for what length of time (one of my coworkers wanting him gone for the rest of the year), we decided on a month trial basis. Now we are not going to tell him it is only a month, but we think any less than that would not show us whether or not there is a true behavior change. We will draft a contract with all our signatures saying that he has to earn his way back into the classroom and if the behavior returns, he will be sent back to the behavior pod with no chance of return for the rest of the year. \\n\\nI do want to address some of the hate messages I got, as it is clear many people don't now what it is like to be a teacher in this current climate. \\n\\n1. For those saying I should have just \\\"called the security the first time,\\\" our school only has security once a week, on random days, and we are never notified when they are on campus. When a kid is being extremely bad, you just have to hope that either A) security is there, or B) the threat of calling them is enough to make the kid calm down. Schools are severely understaffed across the board - there is a lack of teachers, paraeducators, bus drivers, janitors, etc. Some of our classes have 36 kids in them at a time and that amount is already hard to juggle when they are al well-behaved. So for those of you criticizing me, or claiming that this could never happen because kids could not possibly be this bad, put your money where your mouth is and come volunteer at your local public school. \\n\\n2. For those asking me why I hadn't moved him to the behavior pod already, I think you are severely overestimating the amount of power teachers have. That decision is almost never left up to us. In this case, this student has had so many complaints of violence and disrespect documented that the school is finally able to do something. Teachers deal with verbal and mental abuse on a daily basis, and this last year is some of the worst I have seen when it comes to them actually facing physical violence. A kid told one of our teachers she hopes her baby has a miscarriage and dies, and another kid punched our PE teacher in the face when he tried to break up a physical altercation and was allowed back into the school a week later. \\n\\n3. For those of you telling me to take time out my day to \\\"mentor\\\" him. I know you mean well, but I genuinely ask you with what time am I supposed to do that? Teachers already work 20-40 extra unpaid hours a week. Most that I know dedicate 5 am to 8 pm doing lesson planning, grading, making parent phone calls, creating seating charts, etc. The only time would be after school, and I am not meeting one-on-one with a kid who threatened to punch me in the face. Nor, to be frank, should I have to. I have a lot of students who I have built personal connections with, who feel like they can trust me, who tell me my classroom is their safe space. These kids have overcome some crazy adversities, and yes, at the beginning of the year, some of them did not like me/talked back to me; but never did they threaten me, and that makes all the difference to how far I am willing to go for them. Sorry-not sorry. \\n\\n4. Lastly, for those who are claiming I actually did \\\"threaten\\\" the child, you are intentionally ignoring the fact that I stated I would never get into a physical fight with a minor. I meant it when I told him there is no point in trying to fight me, because I am not going to put my hands on a child; however, just because he is a kid does not mean he gets to make threats to my physical safety. Half of my students are way bigger than me, and their age does not preclude them from actually being able to hurt me. No one has the right to threaten to punch someone in the face because they didn't get their way and just because were adults doesn't mean we have to let them. In the real world, if a 13 year old walked up to an adult who wasn't a teacher and tried to fight them, that adult would have every right to fight them back. The kids should learn sooner or later, before they find themselves facing assault charges as adults.\\n\\nNow it is time for me to be a bit rude, but I feel I have to be a bit blunt with some of the parents in this sub. I hate to break it to some of you, but you have failed at your job. When teachers returned to the classroom after COVID lockdown, we dully expected their to be academic and maturity deficits, what we did not expect was for you to neglect your child for damn near two years and not teach them how to be good people. Some of you confuse the responsibilities of parenting and teaching. It is not up to us to teach your children how to be good people, they should be learning that at home, and if they aren't, chances are it is because you are not equipped to teach them because you yourself are not a good person. We have to stop using trauma as an excuse for kids being extremely disrespectful. There are people who spent their childhoods during great world wars, who spent their childhoods facing constant unfettered racism, who spent their childhoods unable to even think about being true to their identities because of the brutal time period they lived in, yet we are only seeing these off the wall behaviors emerge in the last ten years. That is telling.\"", "title": "Went into a meeting thinking I was going to get fired for a verbal exchange I had with a student, and the principal took my side!", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/sl7dw9/went_into_a_meeting_thinking_i_was_going_to_get/"}, {"author": "Head_Spirit_1490", "created_utc": 1706125260.0, "link_flair_template_id": "4433b45a-146b-11e9-a469-0ee696cc69a0", "link_flair_text": "Policy & Politics", "num_comments": 1234, "post_id": "19ep7ew", "score": 7681, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"I work at a high school in special education resource room.

Deadline is tomorrow and they are still working as we speak (12:00 AM EST). Your hard work is why it's worth it!\\n\\nI wrote this as a comment in a post today but I feel like it needs to stand on it's own as well. To start: I don't work for Treering, but this all came out of a post about potentially switching to Treering for yearbooks. I think it's really important to understand how Jostens did the smoke and mirrors routine for years until they finally got caught. Here it goes:\\n\\nAs technology teacher, I took over yearbook advising last year to raise funds for our tech department. Immediately upon taking over I was sent invoices from Jostens in the amount of ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. What? How do we OWE for a yearbook that costs $78 (price goes from $55 to $78 by the end)? Where is the money going? That question led me down the biggest and shadiest rabbit hole I have ever seen. \\n\\nFirst, when asked to send an itemized invoice, Jostens was hesitant. Finally, after persistence, I got it, and low and behold the numbers just didn't add up.\\n\\nWhy? Well first off I had nothing to go off of because they had not sent a contract IN THREE YEARS, so I could not even refute pieces of any agreement. Secondly, a line item showed up in the top right in small print on our invoice saying \\\"production fee\\\". What was this? After pressing again, Jostens was making us pay $100 FOR THE FIRST 50 BOOKS, AND WE WERE SELLING THEM FOR $55 a piece! That's right; our kids were buying books for negative fundraiser profit. No mention of this in any contract. No mention of this even on the line items in the itemized invoice. Nothing.\\n\\nSo I go down the lines and - oh hey! - we are getting charged ~~$1500~~ $860 for \\\"advertising materials\\\", . Sweet. I never asked for this, you just sent a box of posters. If we made them ourselves it would have cost us maybe $50. But tack on another ~~$1500~~$860, awesome.\\n\\nSo I'm already at our wits end by the time the books arrive, and things get even better. I count the books and while we ordered 320, we received ~~375~~365. Why do we have so many extras? JOSTENS SENT US THEM WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION, AND CHARGED US! They claimed it was for kids who forgot to order them so we could sell them, but if you look at the numbers of books it conveniently brought the small amount of profit we made to zero. They then want you to return the books by a certain date (usually in the summer) for a credit refund. JOSTENS ZEROS YOU OUT WITH EXTRA BOOKS AND HOPES YOU DON'T SEND THEM BACK.\\n\\nYou think that's the end? Oh boy, not even close.\\n\\nSo after months of being pushed around, I made it one of my absolute priorities to get these kids the most money I could back. I nit-picked every little detail, knowing full well that Jostens had no legal ground on things because no contract was signed and our students had paid a lot of money to this shady company. I argued about advertising, I contested them about the extra books, everything. In all, Jostens waived around $5000 in money owed. Think about that for a second. Jostened erased ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. at the wave of a wand. If you can magically erase ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34 out of nowhere, what does that mean for the charge to begin with?\\n\\nSo finally satisfied that I could be rid of the plague that is Jostens for ~~$1,400~~ $1,475.82, we sent paperwork to our downtown financials to pay our balance and move one. That should be the end of the story right?\\n\\nWrong. Downtown gets back to us and notices that JOSTENS IS CHARGING US TAX ON OUR YEARBOOKS. They collected taxes that never existed, to the tune of ~~$1600~~ $1,614.79. So, livid, I send an email to JOSTENS demanding our payment record for the entirety of our relationship with them and find THEY DID THIS FOR FOUR YEARS. They claimed that they needed a new tax exempt sheet from us but we never sent it in. They had the old one, which is THE SAME NUMBER as a new one, but that's what the problem was. They are supposed to be cutting a check to us now for around $6000 (5/11 update: they cut one for $2,737, trying to figure out that now). Now think about how many schools use Jostens and how many schools they potentially did that to. That's a class action lawsuit in the millions of dollars right there.\\n\\nMy blood pressure is up just writing this. They have basically robbed our students for years, and it happens all the time because advisors come and go and rarely have time like I did to catch them and call them on their crap.\\n\\nSo we went with Treering this year. First off, I came in with fangs and demands from the get go because I was so pissed off and jaded from Jostens. I started mentioning everything to the guy and listed all my needs in what I wanted contract wise and he was like \\\"yeah our contract is one page long.\\\" It's literally one page long (front and back). The next thing I asked was the base price, which came out to $35.62 (140 pages, estimated 300 books sold). JOSTENS BASE PRICE WITH ALL THE HIDDEN FEES WAS $58. They were going to bump it down to $40 (so generous!) when I told them we were firing them.\\n\\nSo our Jostens ones sold for $78, and now we sell them at $60. So that's $18 LESS per book and $25 MORE in fundraising money. We went from owing Jostens $3k last year to [raising over $7000 this year](http://imgur.com/a/WYUgM). I have learned that we can do discounts for students with free and reduced lunch, so our goal is to make the books equitable for all students. I think you can do this with Jostens as well, but I didn't have the time during my battle to find out.\\n\\nI love my students and defend them rabidly, and seeing how Jostens treated our school makes me sick. Go do the math on how much Jostens (or ANY yearbook company for that matter) is making on your school and you will be too. I would be upset about any swindling, but public school kids? Our free and reduced kids could never afford even discounted books because prices got out of hand, and all because of shifty tactics and corporate greed.\\n\\nSo on the technical side, Treering is not a big improvement from Jostens software, but I do like the linking with social media and especially Flickr. We post all of our pictures to Flickr for the kids to view, print and share during the year for free, then we can automatically grab from albums and place. The themes are good, a lot to choose from too.\\n\\nI could go on, and if you want to talk more please PM me, I try to tell anyone that will listen this story because it really is an injustice. \\n\\n*********\\nEdit: Admins banned post for \\\"self promotion\\\", so link removed. \\n*********\\n\\nOh man that felt therapeutic getting out!\\n\\nEdit #1: thank you to u/behemothpanzer for submitting to r/bestof , I have put so many hours into fighting this small battle that no one knew about or cared about and it really means a lot to me to see such support. I also wanted to add that I don't just have problems with Jostens, other yearbook companies have done shady things too and I don't even know them. This was from a post at the bottom of the comments about a yearbook company essentially trying to bribe me:\\n\\nAnother thing I didn't point out is that other companies try to lure you in with free gifts. A company told me they would [give me a free $50 gift card just for meeting with them.](http://imgur.com/dAwATtz) Like ME a gift card.

I tried to respond to everyone, and if I missed you I'm sorry I will try tomorrow. It's late hear but I was too pumped about your support!

You maybe (probably) won't remember this, but you suggested I go to see Crater Lake out in Oregon. I did, right after I graduated, when I was 18. It was absolutely beautiful, I loved it. Spent over a week there, hiking all the trails around that amazing park. Now that I'm an adult who's seen as much of the world as I could have seen, given where I'm from and the budget I've had to work with, can I make you a suggestion? B\\u00e2lea Lake in the F\\u0103g\\u0103ra\\u0219 Mountains, in Romania. It's one of the few places that has contended with the beauty I found in Crater Lake National Park that week. The road is practically treacherous, but it's so damn worth it. Absolute beauty. Seasonally dependent, there really wasn't anybody there. It's a pristine glacier lake up in the mountains above the clouds, what more is there to say? You had a gigantic impact on my life, and I truly wish nothing but the best for you moving forward. You deserve the type of story that has a thousand amazing endings. The timing never added up very well, but one of the only reasons I regret not having children sooner is that they will miss out on the opportunity of having \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* teaching them science.\\n\\nI hope you have a happy retirement,\\u00a0\\n\\n\\\\- \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nEdit: Their formatting was so much better, but the copy paste from email to here seems to have ruined it.\"", "title": "I just retired, and upon my retirement, got this email from one of my favorite students that I haven't spoken to since they graduated, 13-15 years ago.", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/145x1m0/i_just_retired_and_upon_my_retirement_got_this/"}, {"author": "None", "created_utc": 1685485105.0, "link_flair_template_id": "001e3cdc-6b46-11e8-83b1-0e104432f86c", "link_flair_text": "Humor", "num_comments": 681, "post_id": "13w3yle", "score": 6333, "subreddit": "teachers", "text": "\"I wish I was shitting you.

This just happened. I don\\u2019t know what to do.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s my first year teaching at an elementary school. Second grade. \\n\\nSo basically Im female and I have a wife, 3 year old, and 6 month old twins. I love my family. And when introducing myself to students, I said that I have a wife and kids to my students. And that\\u2019s it. I didn\\u2019t know that was so wrong, because every other teacher also does it. Right? I never mentioned it again or anything. It was just part of my introduction. \\n\\nEverything was normal for a while, just teaching. Until one day a parent requested a meeting and I of course said yes. In the meeting, the mom was angry at me saying I\\u2019m trying to indoctrinate her daughter. I told her that that was not my intention at all. But she kept going and going very angry. By the end she stormed out saying she\\u2019s reporting me to the district and getting me fired. I didn\\u2019t think she\\u2019d actually do it. I was just so nervous the entire time. But she did, and a little later, the superintendent wants a meeting with me without saying what about but I had a feeling. \\n\\nIn the meeting, he was saying that I should refrain from mentioning my family. I said I never said anything about it except introducing. He was being really annoying, shutting down everything I had to say. It felt so unfair. Like I was being targeted. Basically by the end, he threatened to fire me :) So fun. \\n\\nThe following week I was being watched by an admin. My classroom being observed from the start of school to the end. And he told me to take down my picture frame of a photo of me, my wife, and our children. Which was sitting on my desk. \\n\\nThis whole week kinda sucked. I just wanted to rant. That\\u2019s all. I don\\u2019t really know what to do but I\\u2019ll just listen. I love teaching a lot. It\\u2019s always been my dream. I could be in the wrong. I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019m just so nervous about the entire thing. Sorry for the long post\\n\\n\\nEDIT: I was going to make another post but I don\\u2019t have that much to say. So I\\u2019ll put it in here. Thank you guys for all the help. I didn\\u2019t think it would get this much. Today is Sunday and I talk with the union  on Wednesday. Also I\\u2019ve been looking for a lawyer with the help of my Mother in law because she used to work in law. And filing a discrimination lawsuit, maybe. Depending on what happens. Thank you guys for the help and I won\\u2019t take down the photo. I live in Texas but in a somewhat more liberal part. We\\u2019ve been wanting to move to California for a long while now.
