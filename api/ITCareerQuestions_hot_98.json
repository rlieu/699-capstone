No college education and only high school diploma.  Video gamer. Loved computers. Writing this not as a guide for what you need to do, but what worked and what was successful for me.  I hope it helps someone.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n2009-2010 Helpdesk Tech 18$/hr\\n\\nLoved what I was learning about AD and decided to dig in with Powershell.  Learned the ins and outs of powershell and started to write my own tools to make my job easier: Password reset software, account lookup, pulling information from SCCM, the works.  I'd ask the other guys on my team what they'd like to see or what would make their job easier and I'd find a way to make it happen.  \\nDid this for a year and promoted to helpdesk engineer.  When the engineer position opened up I scheduled a meeting with my manager to make my intent clear.  \\n\\n\\n2011-2012 Helpdesk Engineer 45k/yr\\n\\nHere I was escalation for the techs. Continued to find ways to reduce tickets: self service password reset software, spearheaded windows 7 deployment, reviewed ticket logs, found ways to better leverage existing management tools.  Lobbied for MSFT to come in and do some training with me on SCCM so I could learn the ins and outs of managing a larger userbase (\\\\~1000 employees).  Constantly made contacts with the sysadmins, learned as much as I could about storage, virtualization, linux, etc.  Asked for extra projects. Came in to work an hour early every day and left 1-2 hours after quitting time.  Brainstormed ways to make a difference to the company I worked at to further reduce tickets or workloads from other teams.  \\nScheduled a meeting with the sysadmin manager to make it clear to him that I was interested in being   a sysadmin on his team, and asked him what I could do to be the obvious choice for a promotion.  \\nWithin 2-3mo I was on the team.  Got hands on experience with NetApp, 3PAR, & Linux.  Originally they wanted me for storage and I was happy to oblige.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n2012-2015 Sysadmin 60k-85k/yr\\n\\nStarted out as storage admin at 60k as mentioned at the same company. Helped create volumes, raid groups, etc.  Called all of our vendors and asked them to teach me as much about storage as they were willing.  Went to a few classes for NetApp & 3PAR.  Got certified in NetApp (7mode at the time).  I started automating storage tasks with Powershell.  Got everything automated to where projects that would normally take several hours or days were done in minutes. (FC Storage zoning, for example).\\n\\nAfter a 6mo-year (my timelines are a little fuzzy, hard to remember) and getting this automated and refined, I started working more with the VMware team, learning as much as I could, worked with them on ways we could integrate with storage, I requested a few VMs with rights so I could learn more about VMware (note: this can be really hard in very large organizations where everything is highly controlled and silo'd).  Did the same as before, pushed on it.  One of the VMware guys quit.  I immediately scheduled a meeting with the VMware team manager.  I made it clear that I was interested in taking on the position, and that I had automated my previous role sufficiently to be able to handle both VMware and Storage tasks.  Stated I didn't want a pay raise, but instead requested a VMware VCP training course.  Did the same as before, find where things need to be efficient, find ways to save money for the company, find ways to learn more without your company needing to invest more.  Eventually I was handling Backups, VMware, Storage, Load Balancers (F5), & Physical Compute.  I did not take on or have interest in Network or Security.\\n\\nAfter another year and a half of doing this I scheduled a meeting with the CTO.  I explained that I was doing the job of five and that my salary was out of alignment, I kindly requested that he consider bringing my salary in to the ballpark of where a VMware/Storage administrator should be.  He offered me 75k. I said 85k was more than fair, especially considering what I was doing for the company.  He obliged.\\n\\nBecause I was handling so many different technologies on a day to day basis, I was also working with our vendors that sold us all of those projects.  I learned as much as I could about as many different technologies as possible.  Because I was responsible for what amounted to 5-10m of budget, because I had my hands in all parts of the org, had automated most of my tasks, I was involved in all technology purchases not related to Network or Security.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n2015-2017 Systems Engineer 110k/yr\\n\\n1 year after the salary increase I applied to one of those vendors, or VARs (value added reseller).  I gave the company I worked for a 3 month notice.  They were unable to fill the position and contracted me back for 3 additional months while they proceeded to hire 4 people to replace me, I helped them interview. The new company asked me to move and laid me off after a total of 6 months of employment.  I found a new job 3 days later and accepted.  I worked for a very small outfit doing UCS/SRM deployment for 6 months and got a job at a local var.\\n\\nContinued to learn and push. Learned as much as I could. Bought a home lab. Had my own VMware environment (with free licenses).  Sold, implemented, and supported hardware from all sorts of verticals.  Still managed to stay away from Networking & Security.  If a client bought VEEAM, I would go get the same software I would be deploying for them and do it at home 3-4x before meeting up with the client.  I looked like a pro to the client and I had only used the software the day prior.\\n\\nStarted bugging the AWS guy to teach me more.  You're probably starting to see the pattern by now.  He quit and we were going to lose our AWS partnership unless someone got a solutions architect associate certification within the next two weeks.   I let my boss know that I would handle it, but I needed two weeks off to do it.  Studied every day, 12 hours a day up until the test.  Made my own AWS account and used my own credit card to get things going.  Bought an online training course and pushed on it.  Saved the partnership with AWS and they started giving me AWS projects to work on with clients.  \\n\\n\\n2017-2020 Solutions Engineer/Architect 160k-190k\\n\\nManaged services & private cloud organization reached out to me to help them sell their cloud.  Note, this is all technical sales, NOT hard selling. My commission at the time was only about 20-30% of my pay.  Agreed to sign on. After 2 years of always learning, pushing, and going after more I scheduled a meeting with the Director for Solutions Architecture to make my intent known.  It was pretty funny actually, I've been doing so well (#1 across the company) that when I called him he said \\\"Ah man, I was hoping you'd call me\\\" and I said \\\"Ah good, I'm sure you've been wanting me as a Solutions Architect and I'd be happy to work for you.  Let me know when the first interview is.\\\"  (note: I already knew the guy pretty well, heh, wasn't a cold meeting). Acted as Solutions Architect at around 190k for a year before I started to get incredibly bored.  I was only helping to sell a single product.  Set up kubernetes at home because it was a huge gap for the company and held trainings on containers.  I did not like learning about products that I couldn't sell.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n2020 - Today Solutions Engineer 240k\\n\\nTurned down a job at AWS as a Solutions Architect to work at a large VAR as a Solutions Engineer at the same pay.  I did not want to be limited to only AWS.  Yes, I realize how crazy a statement that can seem to some.  The company I'm at is quite large, but not the behemoth that is AWS.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe path is there ladies & gentleman. You  have to want it so bad it hurts. So bad that you go home wondering how you can make a difference at work.  You go to sleep excited to learn the next new thing tomorrow.  So bad that you're not afraid to schedule a meeting with the CTO to tell him you want more out of your job.  That you'd be willing to make less to learn more.  That you want more pay because you have a track record showing that you've earned it.  That when you start to realize your value you recognize it and move to a new company, expecting a high salary as a result.  **You can't make salary jumps like this by staying at the same company.**\\n\\nI worked hard for this, and you can too.\\n\\nWhat's next? I'll keep pushing.  I think I want to be CTO at a company someday.  Not sure what that path looks like yet.\\n\\nIf this helps one person, it was worth the time to write it up.\"", "title": "My journey from 18$/hr helpdesk to 240k+ over 12 years.

I honestly can not thank you enough for helping me through this hard situation, the advice and kind words you gave me really helped me get through it when I was really overwhelmed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOn to the good stuff. I got a new job! Actually as a network engineer, a career move I was attempting to make but didn't have a lot of confidence. I want to thank everyone again for all the advice I've seen on the subreddit, I was able to get the necessary certs, learn a lot and got lucky enough to get an offer! I just started last week and I am overjoyed to learn something new and be tasked with a new challenge each day. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow for Jim. This was two days after the original confrontation and I was sitting at home looking for job postings, with my nose steadily healing and the cracked rib left me without much mobility. I could still move but it was incredibly painful. It still is fairly bad but it's steadily healing and I should be okay in a few more weeks. Regardless I was sitting in bed on my laptop and my wife told me that she saw a car outside. Guess who showed up to my home? I have literally no idea how he obtained my address but regardless here he was, storming up to my door. He began to bang on the door over and over yelling my name telling me to come outside with a number of other expletives thrown in there. Now I wasn't in much of a position to stand easily and I told my wife not to open the door and call the police. I ended up in an extremely lucky situation here as my neighbor, we'll call him Mike was outside and noticed the commotion. At this point Jim was kicking at the door, essentially attempting to kick it in. Mike ran over and they got into a verbal confrontation just before the police arrived. Jim ended up getting arrested, the police took everyones account of the situation and it even looks like he will be charged for the original assaults. Haven't heard much about it since then, I'm just excited to move on.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI did talk to a lawyer and they are pursuing legal action against the company at this time, I can't say too much about that right now but it looks like it's in my favor.\"", "title": "I was assaulted by our System Administrator [Update]", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/mnjkx5/i_was_assaulted_by_our_system_administrator_update/"}, {"author": "theitofficeidiot", "created_utc": 1616071602.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 324, "post_id": "m7q1g4", "score": 1501, "subreddit": "ITCareerQuestions", "text": "\"There is an update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/mnjkx5/i\\\\_was\\\\_assaulted\\\\_by\\\\_our\\\\_system\\\\_administrator\\\\_update/?utm\\\\_source=share&utm\\\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/mnjkx5/i_was_assaulted_by_our_system_administrator_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTensions have been high at my work place over the past few weeks. We were forced to come back even with Covid restrictions not lifted in the state I reside in. People don't seem to want to be here. I work as a Desktop Support Analyst Tier 2 with 2 tier 1 techs below me. We had a peculiar issue today, something that wasn't in our documentation that got escalated to me and then I escalated it to the proper support team(That the sys admin, we'll call him Jim, was in).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNot even 20 minutes passed before Jim came storming into our room, we have a weird office with the three of us in it, yelling at one of the tier 1s that they didn't list the documentation number correctly and it makes his job impossible. I apologized, told the tier 1 not to worry and that we would make a note and make sure to fix it for next time. I asked him what number he preferred to be added and he spit on me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow I get that this sounds like a rapid escalation but he has previously shown disdain to our team and I don't understand why. I am an extremely professional person who does not like to be involved in company politics and I'm fairly introverted so I keep to myself and do my work. I did swear when he spit on me, but nothing offensive to him. I mean it's Covid! You can't just walk around spitting on people. Apparently the swearing set him off and he was looking for a fight since he pushed me. My tier one that he had yelled at stood up and told him to stop and Jim spit on him. I got between them telling Jim to get out of the office, at this point I did put my hands on him and he punched me in the face. We got into a tustle at this point and are 30 seconds or so of beating on eachother a few coworkers ran in and pulled us off one another. I have a broken nose and needed to go to the hospital.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI receive a call from management that I shouldn't come into the office for the next few weeks while they work everything out. One of my techs told me that Jim is not being punished at all. I feel like I'm being treated unfairly what do I do? HR contacted me to cover themselves and tried to convince me to not press charges.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nShort Update:\\n\\nThank you for guiding me a bit, I'm sort of overwhelmed by the situation. Filed a police report and contacting lawyers in my area. Got away with a cracked rib too it appears. Definitely will be spending time on the resume in the coming weeks.\\n\\nUpdate 2:\\n\\nWow what a day. Got a call that I was terminated moments ago. The other tech who Jim spit on quit and filed his own police report. Thank you to the user who told me to copy the emails from HR and send them to a personal email.

Where do I go from here?", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/m7q1g4/i_got_into_a_fist_fight_with_our_system/"}, {"author": "Team503", "created_utc": 1621636929.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 371, "post_id": "ni4vnm", "score": 1495, "subreddit": "ITCareerQuestions", "text": "\"Here's a few things I posted in response to a question from someone who wanted to get into IT at 26 without any experience.  It's oriented towards people who want to be in infrastructure IT - sysadmins, DBAs, networks engineers, and so on.\\n\\n* **CERTS ARE NICE BUT NOT MANDATORY,** unless you're trying to be an SME. I view them more as something to differentiate you from similar candidates (it tells me you're willing to commit to the time, cost, and effort of passing to enhance your career, the same thing that a bachelor's tells me on a smaller scale)\\n* **WORK FOR AN MSP** for a couple of years; it sucks, they're a grind, but you'll be exposed to most segments of the industry, deal with environments from small to large, and get your feet under you. In my generation this was call centers, but now its MSPs.  I tend to treat years of experience at a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio when they're at an MSP (e.g., if you work two years at an MSP, I consider that the same experience as working 4-6 years at a traditional corporate IT job).\\n* Additionally, MSP jobs let you touch a lot of stuff, meaning you get to try doing stuff and see whether you actually like it. This is very useful - infosec sounds great, but you might actually HATE it (it's very detail oriented, reading piles of log files, and the like - I find it boring as hell).\\n* **GET A FRICKIN DEGREE**.  If you don't have an undergraduate degree (college degree), get back in school and get one. The IT industry is increasingly interested in degrees. Personally, I don't care if you have one or not when I'm hiring, but some companies won't touch you if you don't. It's VERY, VERY hard to get into management especially at the Director level or above without a degree.\\n* **BUILD AND USE A HOMELAB.** Build one and maintain it (I still have mine and use it regularly), and make sure to bring it up during interviews. Tell me about challenges you had with it, what it taught you, etc. If I ask you about your experience with hosted web sites, and you have no professional experience there, you can say \\\"I set up and maintain a requests website for my Plex at home, I have 45 users, and it's fully encrypted with SSL and blah blah blah).\\\" Especially in lower level roles, it's a HUGE plus.\\n* **SELL YOURSELF**. When you're just starting, you don't have much experience and education isn't very impactful. Sell me on your drive to learn, sell me on your intelligence, sell me on your willingness to work hard to earn your place.\\n* On that same vein, **ASK QUESTIONS IN THE INTERVIEW**. Ask about the company, ask about the team, ask about the people on it. Do your due diligence - look me up on LinkedIn if I'm the interviewer, look up the company, be familiar with what we do and what's been happening with us. Show me you care enough about the environment you're going to be in to do the research, and I'm VASTLY more inclined to hire you.\\n* **APPLY ANYWAY**. Even if you don't meet the requirements - most of my job reqs have to get filtered through HR and their idiocy, and people like to add buzzwords and other ridiculousness by the time they're posted. On top of that, I probably gave them a wish list of ten things and they listed all ten things as mandatory - if you can check off two or three boxes on that list, you're probably sufficiently skilled to do the role.\\n* **YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO KNOW EVERYTHING**. I expect people to have to learn new things in every role they take, no matter what level they are. For instance, my current role uses a lot of Hyper-V (dammit I hate it) and every other shop I've ever worked in or run has used VMware for virtualization. It wasn't a barrier for hiring - I simply told the interviewing manager \\\"My experience is in VMware, but the principles and concepts are all the same. I'll start brushing up on my Hyper-V before my start date.\\\"\\n* **THE TEAM FIT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING ELSE**. How you interact with me and my team members is VERY important to me. I'd rather have a good fit I have to train you up a bit than deal with someone who's difficult to interact with. Remember that you spend more time with your coworkers than you do with your SPOUSE, and take jobs accordingly. Spend time chatting about hobbies and interests when interviewing, don't hesitate to outright tell them you want to make sure you're a good fit on the team (it would impress me, even at a fairly senior level, if a candidate told me that)\\n* **IF YOU DON'T KNOW, DON'T LIE**.  I'll see through your lie in half a second - when interviewing, admit your ignorance.  \\\"I'm not familiar with THIS TECH, but it sounds like OTHER TECH and I'd approach that issue this way.\\\"\\n* **NOT ALL MONEY IS GOOD MONEY**. Some place may pay more, but they may also work you 90 hours a week on the regular and micromanage the fuck out of you. Factor work/life balance, your culture fit, growth potential, and everything else (benefits, PTO, etc) as much as you value money.\\n* **IF YOU STAY OUT OF MANAGEMENT, THE SKY IS THE LIMIT.** You can go all the way. My brother is a pretty big deal with Dell's infosec team, and he had minimal IT experience when he got started (like less than 5 years total) and he makes more than I do now. The only reason this isn't true in management is that not having a degree will be a large challenge, and these days, C-level positions almost *require* an MBA. $100k plus salaries are achievable within ten years of starting from scratch, if you make smart choices and work your ass off.\\n* **LINKEDIN IS YOUR FRIEND.**  Keep your LinkedIn up to date and accurate.\\n* **LEARN CLOUD.**  Your town is either an AWS town or an Azure town; figure out which and learn it.  FYI, Dallas is an Azure town.  This idea is based on the concept that certain places are strong in certain industries, and certain industries have a strong preference for a particular cloud provider.  Obviously, there will be plenty of exceptions.\\n* **RESUMES LIST ACCOMPLISHMENTS NOT DUTIES**.  How did you benefit the company?  What was the EFFECT of your change?  Did you improve your team's customer satisfaction rating at the call center?  Did you implement centralized logging and reduce time spent viewing log files 40%?  Did you make an architecture change an improve uptime from three nines to five?  Did you save the company money?  Your title tells me what you did.  I want to know what you \\\\*accomplished\\\\*.\\n* **SOFT SKILLS ARE HUGE**.  People with technical skills are a dime a dozen, but tech people with PEOPLE skills are surprisingly rare.\\n* **DRESS FOR THE JOB YOU WANT NOT THE JOB YOU HAVE**.  Self-explanatory, and remember that more 'important' doesn't necessarily mean more formal.  It doesn't.  Pay attention to how your leaders and peers dress and dress appropriately.\\n\\nI'm sure there's more, but this is what I thought up.\\n\\n**EDIT:** What an incredible response!  Thanks everyone!  I'll be passing this around to some colleagues and making a better list and I'll repost it in a month or so.\\n\\nAlso, some definitions:\\n\\n**MSP is managed service provider**.  It's a company that provides IT services to other companies.  Rosie's Florist Shops may make decent money and have three stores, but they can't afford to hired a skilled sysadmin, DBA, and network engineer to maintain their infrastructure, much less to create and maintain a website for them.  Instead of blowing money, they hire a company that has all those people at hand to do it for them on an ongoing basis.  Some bill per hour, some bill a flat rate, some do a bit of both.  Your MSP does everything from helpdesk and desktop support to planning, implementing, and maintaining your network and systems infrastructure for you.\\n\\n**SME means subject matter expert**.  They're highly specialized and focus their entire career on one tech stack.  They are generally only hired by consulting firms and large companies. My current role wouldn't hire an SME, but my last role had lots. That company is a billion dollar tech company with dedicated teams for MS Engineers, Linux Engineers, VMware engineers, storage engineers, etc.\\n\\nThey had an open spot for an SME last I looked - they needed an expert in Microsoft Systems Center (or whatever they're calling it this week). It's relatively rare skillset, because SCCM is chewy as fuck, expensive to license, and difficult to implement or maintain, but amazing when it's done right. They had a huge environment and needed someone who's entire job was to deal with SCCM.   \\n  That position had been open for over a year and they STILL couldn't find one. Last I heard, they still hadn't. That's an SME.\"", "title": "General advice from a hiring manager and 23 year industry veteran to newbies", "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ni4vnm/general_advice_from_a_hiring_manager_and_23_year/"}, {"author": "LottaCloudMoney", "created_utc": 1556234732.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 311, "post_id": "bhfegj", "score": 1253, "subreddit": "ITCareerQuestions", "text": "\"I started off living in the Midwest, I knew nothing about IT and made $14 an hour as a contractor doing armed security work.

First thing I did was self study and grab 3 certifications.\\n\\n1. AWS Solutions Architect Associate\\n2. AWS SysOps Administrator Associate \\n3. AWS Certified Developer Associate \\n\\n\\nIt took me 87 days to get all 3 of these certifications. After that, I needed to prove my knowledge in a real world way since I knocked the paper certifications out of the way. \\n\\n\\nI did 2 Cloud AWS projects, one was a chat bot integrated into Facebook messenger that has automatic responses I built using Amazon Lex.\\n\\nThe second project was more on the infrastructure side of things.\\n\\nBoth were pretty simple projects for the most part.\\n\\n\\nStep 2: Establish credibility. I started a YouTube channel where I created AWS Cloud tutorials and even showed how to do some things like building the chat bot, hosting websites using s3, explaining what route53 is and the differences between all the options, etc. \\n\\n\\nAfter this, I grabbed 1 more certification. I went ahead and passed the CompTIA Security+ certification so I could open the door to government jobs, though I didn\\u2019t end up at a government job. It only took 11 days, so it wasn\\u2019t too big of a deal.\\n\\n\\nAfter this I created a resume using one of the top formats posted on Reddit and updated all my LinkedIn information. I turned my status to searching for opportunities and started reaching out to recruiters and applying to jobs in cities across the United States. \\n\\n\\nFor specific areas I loved, I created a phone number using that area code and used it on that resume. At one point, I had 5 identical resumes but with different telephone numbers and used each one according to the city I was applying to.\\n\\n\\nAfter doing this, I started getting job offers.

Why is society like this? \\n\\nAll the fake-interested-in-each-other\\u2019s lives office talks, it all just feels so plastic to me. You don\\u2019t care what I did over the weekend. Let\\u2019s be real, nobody gives a fuck what our coworkers have done over the weekend.\\n\\nThen the fake smiles. The ass-kissing to try and get promotions, only to become the manager/staff/senior engineer they always hated. Ask me how many times I\\u2019ve seen this /s.\\n\\nI feel like society is just slowly crumbling in on itself. It\\u2019s just one slow, unsatisfied, black hole, that won\\u2019t stop. When do we stop working so much? When do we as people, focus on living life? When do we as people stop worrying about promotions, and spending time with family, and try to do meaningful things that matter? Why does it feel like time is flying by so excruciatingly fast? I was 24 yesterday. \\n\\nI feel like none of this stuff matters. We\\u2019ll all keep just working, working, working, burning ourselves out, while complaining about our work environments, without doing anything to change it. Everybody loves to complain, but I feel like no one actually wants to change this stuff.

And thank fuck you have the cognizance to recognize that being an asshole is generally regarded as a bad career choice. But I've now dealt with the fourth personnel-related instance of an IT professional being inexcusably rude, callous, or outright confrontational in the last several months. IT has a particular seems to have a problem with asshole senior members, and if I want to impart any wisdom to people entering the industry, it's this:\\n\\n**At no point will being an asshole benefit you. At all. Soft skills are singlehandedly more valuable than any technical skill will ever be, and if you think being the grumpy IT guy that no one wants to deal with will somehow benefit you or your career, then I hope you enjoy being paid 40k a year for the rest of your life.**\\n\\nSo, let's get into why I'm saying this. A little background on me: I've been pentesting for about 10 years now and manage a Red Team for a very, very large and public company. I'm involved in a lot of hiring efforts across our org's technical departments and mentorship efforts.\\n\\nWe're hiring for a new network engineer, and we had two candidates we had narrowed it down to. One candidate was extremely qualified, to the point of amazement from our tech-aligned C-Suite. But when we held our interview with him, it was far and away the worst performance I've ever seen in my life by a herculean margin. We had asked him what he would do in assisting a non-IT person with an IT problem, and his response was, and I quote:\\n\\n>\\\"Nothing. I'm not a fucking babysitter. They can figure it out themselves.\\\"\\n\\nWhen we asked him how he would respond to a specific problem related to.\\n\\n>\\\"Tell them they're a moron. I don't really give a shit about how they feel, if they can't get the job done then I'll make it clear they don't deserve to be in it.\\\"\\n\\nAnd finally, when we said that that would ruffle a lot of feathers, he simply shrugged.\\n\\n>\\\"Not really my problem. This is a company, and I'm here to do a job.\\\"\\n\\nIt amazed me that this man got hired for any positions at all, let alone 20 years worth. Needless to say, we ended the interview immediately, and sent him a rejection email within the hour. There is absolutely no world in which these are the correct answers to any sort of interview question you'll get.\\n\\n**As a Senior member of any team, it is** ***always*** **your obligation to assist and teach those less experienced than you.**\\n\\nA week later, I sat in on an interview for a help desk position. It was well separated from what I was usually involved in, but I was helping out one of the team leads with interviewing, as they were relatively new to it.\\n\\nDuring the interview, one of the steps for the candidate is to replicate a series of calls from \\\"employees\\\" (other IT leads) to gauge how effectively the candidate can walk through basic troubleshooting steps. We don't especially care for technical prowess, that can be taught, but this part is to see entirely how effective they are at working with other people.\\n\\nOne of the call scenarios involved a lady who couldn't get her internet working and was minimally technically inclined, more designed to test soft skills than anything else. But it was clear that the candidate was getting very frustrated very quickly. The call was going incredibly long, and we usually try to cap it at 15 minutes. At one point, the \\\"caller\\\" said:\\n\\n>\\\"I don't really know what's going on here...I'm sorry, but can you just get your manager for me?\\\"\\n\\nAfter a few seconds, he exploded.\\n\\n>\\\"Look bi--\\\"\\n\\nHe caught himself and the rest of the team leads sat in silence on the other end of the call. After several seconds of silence, he slammed his desk with his fist.\\n\\n>\\\"Look, I don't know what to tell ya, if you don't know how to use Google then you should probably find another job lady. Anything else?\\\"\\n\\nThis is so outstandingly not how you get a job. I don't know where this kid learned his interview skills but it's clear it wasn't from any practical experience. Don't be like this.\\n\\n**Do not, under any circumstances, take your frustration out on anyone in the work place, especially someone for whom** ***it is your literal job to help them.*** **You'll find many cases wherein you'll work with non-IT people. It's your job to know IT, not theirs, and knowing how to teach someone is one of the most valuable skills you'll learn in your entire career.**\\n\\nA few weeks ago, we had an incident our blue team was addressing. We had just hired a new kid to train into incident response as a junior member, and he was training under one of the senior members. Being Red Team, I don't get especially involved in IR efforts, but on a whim I decided to check in and see how things were going. I then had to listen to this new kid literally cry to me because the senior member had cheweed him out for not knowing extremely advanced digital forensics concepts. He sent me some of the chat logs between him and the senior member, and I was amazed that this kid didn't quit on the spot. Some of them included:\\n\\n>\\\"You have the CISSP! How do you not know how to dump the RAM of an infected machine? Are you serious?\\\"  \\n>  \\n>\\\"This is a waste of my time.\\\"  \\n>  \\n>\\\"It's amazing that you got hired.\\\"\\n\\nAside from the fact that the CISSP has next to nothing to do with the nitty-gritty of digital forensics, the fact that a seniormost member had this kind of behavior towards a junior he was explicitly told to train, it astounded me that this happened at all. I told the new kid we would go to HR together and make sure this was resolved. I can't even begin to describe how much I cannot stand this kind of behavior in the workplace. If you're a grown-ass adult, you have no excuse to behave like this to a junior member at all, especially one you were specifically instructed to take under your wing and build up into a senior member.\\n\\nAs this particular senior member was not under my jurisdiction, I was in no position to be telling him off for his behavior. But I had a very strong conversation with his team lead about the kind of behaviors he was fostering on his team. Thankfully, HR had already given him a heads up on what happened. Behaviors like this are cultivated from the top down, and at no point should you ever make someone's job more difficult because of your ego. Yes, there are going to be hard days, but that is absolutely no reason to take your anger and frustration out on anyone in the workplace. Absolutely no exceptions.\\n\\n**As you grow in your respective industry, it will be incredibly easy for you to forget what it was like to be a beginner, and to assume that what you know is baseline knowledge in your industry. The more you keep this in mind, the more it will make working with your colleges and subordinates significantly more positive. A little empathy can go a very, very long way.**\\n\\n**tl;dr: Don't be an asshole.**\"", "title": "I can't believe I have to say this: Being the \"asshole IT guy\" isn't nearly the steadfast character trait you think it is.", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/lzx2su/i_cant_believe_i_have_to_say_this_being_the/"}, {"author": "Derangedteddy", "created_utc": 1643900254.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 232, "post_id": "sjl9h7", "score": 1067, "subreddit": "ITCareerQuestions", "text": "\"I have had multiple run-ins with people giving phenomenally bad advice that could land people in the unemployment line and/or keep them there.

I've divided this post into three sections: Foundational Tier, Advanced Tier, and Expert Tier. If you already have knowledge from a previous tier, start at the tier after. After discussing the tiers and what knowledge to obtain, I\\u2019ll have a bonus \\u201cextra tips\\u201d section that will discuss resumes, websites for learning tech, and job hunting.\\n\\n**Disclaimer before I begin:** This is just my opinion on how to get started or skill-up in this industry. I'm obsessed with IT hiring/job data, and I scour several job sites and look at financial salary reports based on what skills are in high demand, and I read a lot of job posts. Just to give you a sense of where I'm at in my own career at the moment, I'm currently a Sys Admin in the fin-tech industry. Sites I analyze data/job posts from: Dice, Robert Half, Indeed, Linkedin, Glassdoor, Zip Recruiter, Medium, and select subreddits pertaining to IT/Tech.\\n\\n**Foundational Tier:** For those just starting their IT career journey, this is where you start. A good way I like to gain new knowledge is to study for specific certifications, so I\\u2019ll be recommending certs to study for as we go. You don\\u2019t necessarily need to obtain the certs, but having them on your resume will make it look good and with certain certs demonstrate practical knowledge.\\n\\n* If you\\u2019re completely new to computer hardware/software/IT, I recommend glancing over an A+ certification study guide, it will teach you the basics of hardware and desktop/laptop/printer administration.\\n* Two skills I recommend every IT professional to have it **Networking** and **Linux**. As a bonus, many companies also have Windows Server operating systems, so studying for the **MCSA Server 2016 (or relevant Azure cert)** certification wouldn\\u2019t be a bad idea.\\n   * For networking knowledge, study for the **Network+ or CCNA** certifications. Net+ is more beginner friendly, and CCNA goes into more depth and focuses on Cisco specific networking equipment (you can also choose a Juniper cert as well, because it\\u2019s a popular networking equipment vendor too).\\n   * For Linux knowledge, study for the **Linux+, LPIC-1, or RHCSA** certs (I recommend RHCSA because the exam is performance based and it will show employers that you have hands-on experience with Red Hat Linux).\\n* **Update:** The **Google IT Support** Course path on Coursera is a great set of courses that teaches a broad range of systems administration, linux, and security, check it out!\\n\\n**Advanced Tier:** For the Advanced Tier we\\u2019re going to focus on programmatic/command line skills. Here are four items that are super good to learn, and if you have knowledge in these areas you will open up your career opportunities: **Python, Powershell, Bash, SQL/Databases**. Now I advise you pick two of these and get good at them, but if you want to be super cool learn a little about all of them. \\\\*\\\\* As a bonus for the Advanced Tier, I recommend learning some **Configuration Management**. Configuration Management options include: **Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Salt Stack.**\\n\\n* **Python** is a programming language, but can also be used by system administrators as a scripting languages to automate manual tasks. For learning Python there are tons of resources, but a good one I\\u2019ve found is a book/Udemy course called: **\\u201cAutomate The Boring Stuff With Python\\u201d**. There\\u2019s a website for it where you can read the book for free online, you can buy the paperback version, and there\\u2019s a cheap Udemy course that follows along with the book as well.\\n   * **Update:** Google has come out with a new course path on Coursera called: **IT Automation W/Python**, I enrolled in it right now and it's really good!\\n* **PowerShell** is the windows command line on steroids, and learning it will make people think you\\u2019re a wizard on any Windows computer/server. A good way to learn PowerShell is the **\\u201cLearn Powershell In A Month Of Lunches\\u201d** book.\\n* **Bash** is the command line equivalent of the Linux/Unix world. Bash is used to give Linux commands and to use as a scripting language like PowerShell to administer Linux systems. A good resource for learning Bash are books like **\\u201cThe Bash CookBook\\u201d** or **\\u201cLearning Bash\\u201d**. Studying for the above mentioned Linux certs will also teach you bash.\\n* **SQL** stands for Structured Query Language, and is used to manipulate and gather data from databases. People that know SQL definitely do not have issues finding jobs, so I thought I\\u2019d include it on the list. There are several SQL courses on the **Udemy** website that are good for learning SQL and database skills (at the end of this reddit post I will share other sites that are great for IT/Tech learning, so stay tuned). Alternatively, you can study for the **MTA Database Fundamentals** certification. **Edit:** It's been pointed out in the comments that another great resource for learning SQL are the **T-SQL Fundamentals and T-SQL querying books by Itzik Ben-Gan**.\\n* For learning **Configuration Management**, **Linux Academy** has videos that cover these pieces of software. You get a free trial when you sign up with them, plus they have videos in a \\u201cfree tier\\u201d that cover the basics of a variety of different topics.\\n* **Edit - Security:** Someone brought up the fact that I left out information security, so I will add a bit about that. The **Security+** cert is a good place to start with security, as is working with **SELinux**. After the basics of the Security+ there are a plethora of certs that teach more advanced security knowledge, companies such as **ISACA, SANS, ISC2, and CompTia** (to less of an extend than the formers but still worth mentioning) offer such certs. Information Security practices are also taught in specialty certs for many of the Orgs listed in this post such as Cisco, Aws, Azure, etc (Example: AWS Security Specialty).\\n* For additional coding/programming knowledge, you can visit the following sites: FreeCodeCamp, Codeacademy, TeamTreeHouse, TheOdinProject\\n\\n**Expert Tier:** For the Expert Tier I\\u2019m going to recommend Cloud, and Containerization technology. The Tech world is heavily shifting to use these two awesome technologies, and knowing them will get you some pretty awesome and unique jobs.\\n\\n* For **Cloud** knowledge, you\\u2019ll want to pick one of the three big providers **(AWS/Azure/Google Cloud)**, and study for their certs. AWS has the **Solutions Architect/Developer/SysOps** certs (or the **Cloud Practitioner** at the very beginner level), Google has its **Associate Cloud Engineer** cert, and Azure has certs as well but their names escape me.\\n* **Containers** are really super cool. There\\u2019s a few big players in this arena: Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift (this one is for Red Hat Linux). Docker has the **DCA** cert you can study for, Kubernetes has the **CKA** cert (they have a developer cert as well), and OpenShift has specific Red Hat certs hat cover its material.\\n\\n**Extra Tips/Info**\\n\\n**Websites with good learning resources**:\\n\\n* **Free:** Youtube, EdX, Coursera, Udacity (some), Udemy (some)\\n* **Pay for:** Udemy, Linux Academy, ACloudGuru, Linkedin Learning, PluralSight\\n\\n**Resume:** Make sure your resume is spiffy and shows off all of your talents. Make sure it markets you in a great way. Get the help of a resume professional if you have to. Once that is done make sure you make a profile (make it look nice and spiffy) on big job sites **(LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Dice, Indeed)** and post your resume on all of them.\\n\\n**Labbing:** This is a huge one. Practicing new technologies/software at home is a great way to level up your skills and show employers you have the drive to learn new things and become better. You can do this in two ways:\\n\\n* **Physical machines:** You can buy new or get old/junker computers/servers and put Linux and other operating systems on them, network them together, and use this setup to practice system administration skills.\\n* **Virtual Labbing:** Or you can use software like **Virtual Box/VMWare** to create virtual servers and practice system administration that way.\\n* **Cloud Labbing:** Same as above, but making virtual machines and entire enterprise environments in the cloud. When you sign up for an account with any of the big cloud providers, they give you introductory credit to experiment with the cloud and understand how it works.\\n\\n**Location Matters:** When hunting for IT/Tech jobs, location matters. Remote jobs are possible, but good ones can be hard to find. If you\\u2019re in a small/rural city, I recommend looking for jobs near bigger cities/capital cities/tech hubs. **Indeed and Glassdoor** are great websites to scope out jobs in other cities, and see how salaries are in those cities. Now I know that not everyone is in a situation to move, but I will tell you that it\\u2019s worth it. I lived in a small southern town, moved to a capital city for work, and it was amazing. Perhaps I\\u2019m biased because I made the move and it turned out good for me, but I recommend considering moving if you\\u2019re in an area that does not have a good tech market.\\n\\n**Edit Feb, 2020** Time for some updates! Google came out with am amazing course path on coursera, on how to do IT automation with python, so I'm adding that to the list. I'm also adding the Google IT Support course path to the beginner tier.\\n\\n**Edit May 2022** I've since made another post similar to this one, check it out here: \\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/szrxz6/my_advice_on_how_to_level_up_your_it_career_cloud/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\"", "title": "Want to start/level-up your IT career?

I wanted to share my experience going from unemployed to making $85K in IT in case it helped anyone.\\n\\n# My background:\\n\\n  \\nI went to college and I studied business. The program at my school was really weak and it was difficult for me to get hired at jobs right out of school.\\n\\n  \\n\\u00a0I was decent at writing and got hired to write for an online publication but the pay was very low and the job prospects in the field we're pretty weak.\\u00a0 The online publication was related to technology and it gave me an interest in software cloud computing and other cool things that were happening in the world that I wanted to explore further.\\n\\n  \\n\\u00a0During the pandemic I had been laid off.\\u00a0 I had been reading about CompTIA and other IT certificates to get into the field and I decided to take the A+.\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\nI spent basically all my free time watching Professor Messer videos and also doing as many technical tasks.\\n\\n  \\nI started off by setting up my emails on my phone or setting up Zoom calls for my family members during Thanksgiving.\\u00a0 I would go to Micro Center and buy computer parts and try to build my own PC and then take it apart so I knew how it all worked. \\u00a0I would put Windows on a flash drive and learn how to boot up the OS myself.\\n\\n  \\n\\u00a0I took free online classes on coding that really helped me stand out during my interviews.\\u00a0 I don't code at all during my job but for whatever reason people seemed impressed when they know that you can code.\\n\\nThese were simple things but I felt much more prepared and technical after doing them.\\n\\n  \\n\\u00a0After I passed the A+  I started applying to jobs on indeed.\\u00a0 Within a few weeks I landed an interview for a Help Desk position and it was very basic I was able to answer most of the questions as they related to my A+ studies and some had been from the simple technical tasks I was doing.\\n\\n  \\n\\u00a0I landed a job as a level one technician making $40,000 a year.\\u00a0 The work was hard and low paying but I did have an income and I was grateful for that.\\u00a0 In my free time I tried to learn as much as I could on the job I also started working on the Security Plus certificate after I passed this I was able to start taking on some cybersecurity work at my company and got a slight pay bump to $45,000 a year.\\n\\n  \\nAt some point I felt that I learned everything I could at my help desk job and I couldn't progress any further. I started applying to as many jobs as I could for better paying positions. This job search was much more difficult than the first one it took me almost 6 months.\\u00a0 I finally landed an offer for a junior systems administrator position that paid $85,000 a year.\\n\\n  \\n\\u00a0I was ecstatic as my goal salary I was shooting for was $65,000. The job that I got was in a major urban center so the salary was very high. The downside is that I have a very long commute almost 3 hours a day.\\n\\n# My advice:\\n\\n* Don\\u2019t sit around and wait for the perfect job to come to you. If you're not hearing back from entry level jobs keep applying but also look into other areas. Explore your local tutoring center and see if you can teach kids to code. Check out Geek Squad at best buy or your local PC repair shop. Also look at customer service jobs. Many of the customer service skills you will learn will translate over to your entry-level IT jobs and also your higher level IT jobs were you may be in a lot of meetings with people.\\n* Create a list of technical exercises to work on in your free time and take as many free online courses as possible. There are now free online IT certificates from Microsoft and Google you can work on. This will help you build up that sense of familiarity with technology.\\u00a0\\n* Reflect on how far you've come not how far you have left to go. There are some really technical people at my company and it's kind of crazy how much they know. When you feel like this just reflect on the progress you've made. Just 2 years ago pinging a server was the most advanced IT task I knew how to do. Now I manage and maintain 50 virtual machines on Azure, handle cloud backups on AWS, and have migrated our company to a new cloud based ticketing system.As you get more advanced I advise signing up for a online program like CBT Nuggets because they will give you access to virtual labs to do more complex IT tasks.\\u00a0\\n* Set small manageable goals that you can actually achieve. Check out the SMART goal setting framework. \\n* Set aside one day a week to just chill. You don't always want to be learning and hustling to get ahead. Hang out with friends, watch movies, or spend time in nature on this day.\\n\\n  \\nI will be staying around to advise people in r/CompTIA, r/GetAJobInIT, and r/ITCareerQuestions so feel free to ask me for advice.\"", "title": "I entered the IT field unemployed and with no experience. 2 years later I'm making $85K.

Browsing this subreddit wondering, how to break into IT. I wanted to write this up for all you guys doing the same thing. You are wondering how long it will take, how long until you make X amount of money. What certs you need, etc. Everyone's story will be different. I am 1000% confident there are people much smarter than myself who aren't making this money, or it took them longer than five years. A lot of it is timing, lucky breaks, etc. This is just the story of how I prepared myself to take advantage of my lucky breaks. You can do it too. It might take you ten years. You might do it in 3 years. Life is random, but you can control you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI was stuck a retail sales job I hated. But I was making 60k per year with no degree, so I felt hopelessly stuck. Money was the best I could hope for, for someone with my skillset and qualifications. I was interviewing for assistant store manager jobs in the company at the time and kept getting rejected. This sales job also happened to be a for a major cellular provider so I started to realize I was very good at troubleshooting phones, apps, etc. I also developed very good people skills due to the nature of sales. This was my foundation. I had a very close relative that worked in IT, who threw the ladder down to me so to speak. They encouraged me to get certifications and get started on a helpdesk at some point. \\\"Pay my dues on the help desk for around a year.\\\" he would tell me. I would frequently dream about getting out retail and working in IT. I was very good at troubleshooting these mobile phones, and I was discovering I was a nerd who was good with people. I ended up building a computer and that made a light bulb really click with myself. The first time it booted I felt like a caveman who made fire.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOne day in the summer/fall of 2017 I had a customer come in. I was very professional and kind. As we talked about life, it turned out they were the Senior director for HR at a very large nationally recognized company with a HQ in our town. Several times I saw they posted help desk jobs, but I never was brave enough to apply. I didn't have the experience. I mentioned that to her. She immediately encouraged me to apply and said I'm positive they could use someone like you on the helpdesk.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI interviewed with three managers and was hired shortly after. My income dropped from 60k down to 37k, but I knew it wasn't forever either. My work life balance improved dramatically as well. I had escaped retail hell. I busted my ass on the help desk. It was a combo of being thankful to have the opportunity, but also wanting to learn as much as I could. While other co-workers griped and complained about endless BS we dealt with (which we did deal with BS for sure) I just kept grinding.  I obtained my A+, Net+, Sec+ and CCNA R&S while working there for a year and some change.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn late 2018 early 2019 I started working at an ISP, because of my newfound CCNA knowledge and networking skills I acquired. I was making about 47k. The job was a nightmare, the company was a shitshow and completely unstable. In spring of 2019 I knew I needed to bail for my family and my own sanity. I was desperately applying to any and everything I could and hearing nothing back even from lesser helpdesk jobs. One night I scrolled past a job posting for a job with an Engineer level title. I looked at it, they were asking for tons of Windows Server experience, experience with Linux and Red hat, and some other things I didn't have much experience with. I initially closed the page and kept moving. I then remembered how much I hated my current job. I went back and threw in a Hail Mary application.\\n\\nSure, enough I got the job. Nobody matches everything on all job postings. But what I had were fundamental networking skills. This job was basically a solo IT person for a region of a pretty large privately owned company. They needed a blend of people skills and tech skill. I had a main campus that was mine, and multiple industrial locations as well. The pay was in the range of 50-70k depending on how you looked at it and went up over time. This was the best mid-level job I could have asked for. The experience I got was insane. Sure, there was lots of end user BS being the only IT person around. But everything was mine. I was basically cut loose to make things happen. When we had new locations to bring online. I designed, ordered, configured, installed the networks. When we would change firewall vendors, I would handle that as well. Anything you could think of. I got my hands on. Occasionally I'd have to reach out to some senior guys elsewhere in the country for help. But my region was mine, and it was up to me to keep business operations going especially on the network side and maintaining the hardware and servers that ran our critical applications.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI became very comfortable realizing I don't know a lot of shit. Imposter syndrome is a normal feeling for me. What I do know, is that if you understand networking, know the OSI model, and can google stuff well. There's really not a ton of stuff you can't figure out. Nobody remembers or knows everything in every area of IT. It's about fundamental skills that allow you to understand new technology quickly.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nRemember my close relative from earlier? Well, they had their CISSP for several years, and I watched their income basically go parabolic since that point. So, I made that my next step. I had just over five years in IT and my roles all along the way had at least two of the domains covered the entire five years. So, I obtained my CISSP certification in January of 2023. The CISSP ***DID NOT make me a cyber security guru***. It changed my thinking from tech first, to business first. I think about risk and business impact first and foremost at this point. This is extremely valuable to the market. Tech is cool and all but companies want to make money. If they don't, you don't have a job. If you can speak that language, they will want to hire you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI recently accepted a position making north of 130k annually for a very large corporation in network security. The whole thing doesn't feel real to me, and just like everyone else my inner imposter is still there. But once again, I'm just going to keep busting my ass and embracing what I don't know, so I can grow even more skills. This isn't a brag. Trust me I'm just a dude, who is quite unimpressive. If I can do it, anyone can do it. Learn networking fundamentals at all costs, work hard as hell, and embrace being uncomfortable learning new stuff.\"", "title": "My story of going from 0 experience to 130k in 5 years", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/11a7um0/my_story_of_going_from_0_experience_to_130k_in_5/"}, {"author": "it-throwaway-lol", "created_utc": 1645156405.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 183, "post_id": "sv8734", "score": 850, "subreddit": "ITCareerQuestions", "text": "\"Edit: wow, I posted this last night before I went to bed, thanks for all the kind words, im going through and answering some questions now.\\n\\nIt can be done!

Worked like a dog to impress higher ups.  Always took the initiative, especially to learn.\\n\\nWhat I did wrong: It could've easily not worked.  Luck played a really big part.\\n\\nHow I got lucky: I got noticed and moved to deskside support almost immediately.  I won't deny how lucky this was.  I'm not going to downplay my part in this, though; if I had not been on the ball, I would not have been moved up.  I just recognize that I got lucky here.\\n\\n**Very Big Company 1** - Deskside Support ~40-50k USD, 2.5 Years\\n\\nWhat I got right: Worked hard, learned a lot.  After a slump a year in, got back on and continued learning.  For the last year, pressured my team lead into allowing me to work evenings, used quiet hours to learn Powershell, Python, C#.\\n\\nWhat I did wrong: Stayed for waaaaaay too long.  I was still a contractor at Very Big Company 1 after nearly 3 years, hoping to get hired on.  Don't rely on verbal promises, folks.  Don't be like me here.  I should've stopped contract work after a year and found a full time position.  I didn't realize the scope of IT and how far down the ladder I was.\\n\\nHow I got lucky: Dodged a few toxic coworkers, for the most part.\\n\\n**Midsize Company 1** - Deskside Support ~60-65k USD, 1 Year\\n\\nWhat I got right: Started trying to automate everything using scripting and programming skills learned from personal study time.  That's where everything changed.  I completed well over 5x the work of my coworkers in this environment, immediately bringing me into the spotlight for higher-ups.  Volunteered for a big job that was well out of my pay grade, immediately followed up with superiors about how this meant I deserved a promotion.\\n\\nWhat I did wrong: I was pretty patient and probably could've achieved the next promotion sooner by being more aggressive.  It could also be argued that working a project well above my pay grade could've led to me being taken advantage of.  I'm not sure if I would change that if I could do it over again, though.  I learned a lot, and it ended up paying off.\\n\\nHow I got lucky: Manager was great, company recognized talent and promoted from within.  I could've gotten used, instead I got promoted.  I also was placed in an environment that desperately needed automation, so my skills were perfectly timed.\\n\\n**Midsize Company 1** - Systems Engineer ~100k USD, 1 Year\\n\\nWhat I got right: Didn't stop automating and learning.  Grabbed projects and worked hard to become an expert at the systems I owned.  Put myself in a cupcake situation by setting up working systems and thinking toward the future.  Started working from home full time.\\n\\nWhat I did wrong: I wasn't a hawk for my own benefit.  I was seeing stars from the 100k number, so I didn't realize that I was actually getting underpaid compared to others who did the same job.  (Previous guy in my position was sitting on 125 with just as much experience)\\n\\nHow I got lucky: Coworkers and company loved me.  Never ended up on-call, never ended up getting trapped in office politics.\\n\\n**Midsize Company 2** - Sr. Systems Engineer ~125-135k USD, 1 Year\\n\\nWhat I got right: Recognized my worth and started becoming a hawk for my own benefit.  Started negotiating salary.  Put up a working Github that highlighted my skills, updated LinkedIn with current resume and skills.  Stayed working from home, despite slightly better offers from other companies who were in office.\\n\\nWhat I did wrong: Still kind of went the safe route, following a previous manager.  He knew how much I made at Midsize Company 1, so he knew a 'reasonable' amount to pay me.  This probably cut my potential pay by 5-10k.\\n\\nHow I got lucky: Still no on-call, little stress, work from home, basically one of the easiest jobs I could imagine, while still being engaging and fairly enjoyable.\\n\\n**Very Big Company 2** - Sr. Staff Collaboration Tools Engineer ~170k USD, 6 Months (current)\\n\\nWhat I got right: Kept my ears open and pushed recruiters for higher and higher pay.  Leveraged 2 different recruiters against each other and my previous company to get a better situation.  Demanded no on-call and the ability to work remotely.\\n\\nWhat I did wrong: May have taken the slightly worse job; the pay was comparable but the benefits were oversold for this job.  Nothing major here, just nitpicking.\\n\\nHow I got lucky:  2 recruiters came to me at the same time, allowing me to leverage them against each other.

They think computers are cool, they love the newest phones and game systems. They\\u2019re just fascinated by technology. 90% of you are probably the \\u201cIT guy\\u201d for your family. You\\u2019re coming here thinking \\u201cI\\u2019m good with computers!\\u201d\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n**No, no you are not.**\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nNow hold on, before you burn me at the stake for trying to insult your intelligence and capabilities. Let me tell you, the thing about IT is that being able to build a computer, or google your answers doesn\\u2019t make you good with computers. The knowledge behind IT doesn\\u2019t \\u201ccome naturally.\\u201d These are COMPLEX systems.\\u00a0 There is so much to technology that you haven\\u2019t scratched the surface on.\\u00a0 There\\u2019s networks, servers, coding, engineering, VPN\\u2019s, TCP/IP, WAN, PKI\\u2019s etc. There\\u2019s so much more to a computer that a lot of people underestimate/overlook. You need to educate yourself one way or another.\\u00a0 If you\\u2019re thinking \\u201cI can\\u2019t afford college!\\u201d or \\u201cCollege isn\\u2019t for me.\\u201d **Then get your certifications.** They\\u2019re not necessarily cheap, but they are affordable and trust me, you\\u2019re not going anywhere without one or the other.\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nSo where do you start?\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nFirst, what do you want to do?\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n* Software Development\\n\\n* Network Engineering\\n\\n* Cyber Security\\n\\n* System Administration\\u00a0\\n\\n* DevOps\\u00a0\\n\\n* I.T Consultant\\n\\n* Programmer\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nSee, there are tons of different fields that follow \\u201ccomputers.\\u201d Once you decide on which field you want to go into, you need to educate yourself on the field. Grab your CompTIA A+ Certificate. All that says is you know how computers work. It\\u2019s the absolute basics, but it will help you get into a Help Desk/Service Desk position. This position is the starting ground for 98% of the individuals who get into IT. You can\\u2019t just jump in as a Sys Admin, even with a degree. While you\\u2019re at help desk, LEARN. Please, for the love of God, **LEARN**. When you get a call to fix something, and you can\\u2019t figure out how to fix it, so you transfer it to another employee, go back and ask them what they did and *why*. Do not accept the answer \\u201cit just works that way.\\u201d That is the worst approach. You need to know how to fix it next time and why it broke in the first place. This little knowledge will go a long way for you.\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nAlso, while you\\u2019re at a help desk position, continue getting your certificates.\\u00a0 Want to go into network security? Get yourself your Network+, Security+ and your CCNA/CCNP. Want to go into Hardware and Infrastructure? Get your Server+ and CWNA. Software development? You can get your Microsoft Specialist and OCPJP. You\\u2019ll need those certificates to keep moving if you\\u2019re not going to go to college. You need to show your employer initiative and that you know more than just the basics. Now I know what you\\u2019re thinking\\u2026\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u201cHow do I know what certifications will go towards my career?\\u201d\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nWell, here\\u2019s a [PDF](https://certification.comptia.org/docs/default-source/downloadablefiles/it-certification-roadmap.pdf) that shows a general road map of what certifications lead to which careers. Have you noticed that every road on that map starts with a CompTIA A+ certification? That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m telling you to get. You can skip it if you already have a CCNA or something, but if you\\u2019re here and you don\\u2019t have any skills, you have to start at the A+. And you\\u2019ll learn things you didn\\u2019t think you were missing.\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nNow I would always advise to continue your education and also have the certifications behind you to really stand out, but college isn\\u2019t for everyone. Some people are solo learners, some don\\u2019t like tests. Whatever the reason, there are other options.\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nNow, here is where we lose everyone\\u2026\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nYou will not get called back on most, yes **MOST**, of your applications. Anyone here can tell you, most people spend months filling out help desk applications. This field is competitive. Do not be discouraged if you fill out 100 applications and only get 10 call backs. A lot of people feel like they\\u2019ll never get called back, but it will happen. It takes time. You have to just keep filling them out. And be okay with walking away if it\\u2019s a bad fit. Also know that help desk can be, and most likely will be **STRESSFUL.** You\\u2019re not going to just breeze by and relax every day. No, people will call you only when something is wrong. You will be frustrated when things don\\u2019t go your way or you can\\u2019t figure things out. You will not just be building computers all day. You will deal with people who know nothing about what you do, but blame you for everything.\\u00a0 It\\u2019s a thankless job. But if you work at it, and keep your head high and work the best you can, you can move up. Only you can make your career successful. Good luck to anyone reading this, I hope everything goes well for you. You got this!\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0\\nTl;Dr \\u2013 There is none. Read the passage.\\n\\nEdit: Also **PLEASE DO NOT JOIN THIS FIELD JUST FOR MONEY!!!**\\n\\u00a0\\nIn the IT field you have to continue learning. Every day learn something different. You have to love what you do. This isn't a gig just for the big bucks. You gotta love what you do and keep trying to get better if you want to make that 6 figure salary.\"", "title": "How do I get into IT with no degree and no experience?", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/baypxo/how_do_i_get_into_it_with_no_degree_and_no/"}, {"author": "feelingoodwednesday", "created_utc": 1598376804.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 281, "post_id": "iggunt", "score": 801, "subreddit": "ITCareerQuestions", "text": "\"Just a rant.

If you go into an interview explaining yourself the entire time (why you don't have this cert or 'x' amount of experience) you're probably not getting the job. No one wants to work with someone in constant need of approval. The only managers hiring those types of personalities are either desperate to fill the position or are looking for someone they can control, usually in the form of ridiculous hours.  In these interviews simply state what you know and don't know.  That's it. And if you don't know something, I  want to know HOW you would find the answer, NOT a reason for why you don't know.\\n\\nThere are so many posts in this sub-reddit asking where you might land job wise based on experience, certs, education, etc. You need to BREAK OUT of this mentality or else you're going to get bottle necked into shittier roles. If you base your ceiling off of mere education and experience, quit doing that NOW. You need to learn to MARKET YOURSELF. Sell your communication skills, customer service experience, work ethic, ambition, troubleshooting finesse, and so on. What can you tell me about yourself that would drive home the idea that you grind on and off the clock, to better yourself as a professional? What can you tell me to prove that you take pride in your work? If you want to be a linux admin do you troubleshoot your own Linux server? If you want to get into cyber security, have you taken the time to spin up Kali and other virtual environments? If you want to be a network engineer, do you have a subscription to Cisco VIRL? What have you built there? I'm sure you get the point.\\n\\nStop begging for a job and go into your interview with your head held high.  This doesn't mean be an egotistical asshole, but if you're looking for a new job, swing for the fences! Whats the worst that can happen?  Shoot above your experience. If all you have is an A+ and Net+ cert, but you want to be a network administrator or engineer, fuck it! Apply. All they can say is no.  Worst case you never hear back from them, best case you get into an interview.  For years people told me the ONLY way to become a network engineer was by getting a CCNP. Bullshit. They told me I'd have to work 10 years in the industry to get into cyber. Bullshit. They told me I would need AWS certs to get into cloud. Again, bullshit. Once you learn that HR creates bogus job descriptions because they're tech illiterate, you will realize these aren't hard rules, just road maps.\\n\\nIf you're trying to get into cloud, but are constantly being rejected, maybe its not your resume. Maybe it's your inability to sell yourself.  If I look at someones resume who has minimal experience in IT, but can show in the interview that they're hungry, I'll at least bring them in for a 1st round tech interview. If they suck at the tech interview, but are grinding in their free time doing labs, it shows me consistency. It shows you're trying to be better at this vocation.\\n\\nHere's a small secret - as hiring managers, we know you're not where you need to be technically, but we still brought you into the interview. We've seen your resume and know that you're trying to fluff things up a bit to make it seem like you know more than you do. It's OK, we've all been there. The question is, can on the job training get you where need to be and HOW MUCH TIME will it take to bring you up to speed? We KNOW you're going to struggle for the first 6 months, but you're cheaper than hiring a senior or more established engineer. What we want to know, is are you going to be willing to figure things out on your own. When you ask for my help, can I be certain you're doing your own due diligence prior to asking? Will you put in the extra hours to get to where you're useful to the team?\\n\\nFor example, if someone asks you about routing protocols in an interview, you need to put in the time to KNOW THE BASICS. But If you don't know the answer, then tell someone how you would find the answer. Give them the approach to how you would work to drive home a solution that's unknown to you. I've literally been in interviews where a candidate told me how they would use google to search for an answer, down to the wording in the search bar. Nice, I like that! It tells me that you can cover the first step of research instead of hounding me every time you get stuck on an issue. It tells me that you're willing to do the hard stuff.\\n\\nI speak from experience when I tell you that I've never gone into an interview with all of the qualifications posted for a job, NEVER. Not once have I ever thought to myself that my skills were sufficient for jobs that asked for 5-10 years experience. I didn't give a shit.  Sure, I've been turned down many many times, but I've also landed some big wins just based on the fact that I was willing to put myself out there.\\n\\nI am begging you all to just believe in yourself. You're already studying for certifications. You're already on Reddit asking questions about this career path and its future. Perhaps, you're putting in the work at school to complete your degree. Take pride in how hard you're already working for the opportunity and then express that to a hiring manager. As someone who's sat though many interviews, I can tell you that confidence, communication, and customer focus can put you leaps and bounds ahead of the competition. The technical aspect can be taught to those who are willing to put in the hours. However, if you walk into an interview and can stress the importance of what we do from the end users (customers) perspective, I'm interested.\\n\\nBe calm, confident, and shoot for the position/salary you want, NOT what you think a company is willing to pay. Of course be reasonable in your expectations, but don't sell yourself short. If the median salary for someone with a CCNA is $70k/year, but you don't have one, submit for $60k and go from there. If a company can get you at a discount AND believes you're trainable then perfect! If a candidate is 20% over the salary expectations, that doesn't automatically rule them out. If that candidate counter offers, it tells me they value their time. And IF I can swing paying 20% extra to make you that much more happy, motivated, and productive, you can bet I will.\\n\\nDon't be afraid to be disagreeable and negotiate, especially when you've put in the work to land a higher paying job. When you go into an interview, go with the mindset that you have something of great value to offer via time and effort. Go in believing that any company would be LUCKY  to have you on their team. If you don't believe in yourself, how can you expect a company to?\\n\\nGood luck\"", "title": "RANT: For the sake of all things holy, have some freaking confidence", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/nlnvp3/rant_for_the_sake_of_all_things_holy_have_some/"}, {"author": "rbtechtalks", "created_utc": 1614965935.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 111, "post_id": "lyhava", "score": 783, "subreddit": "ITCareerQuestions", "text": "\"I just had my CIO call me out of the blue, on a Friday morning to \\\"chat\\\" that is just the call you want to get Friday morning right? \\n\\nwell, today is employee appreciation day, and he called me to have a video call so he could tell me face to face that he appreciates what I am doing. \\n\\nIf your employer does not appreciate you, someone else will.\"", "title": "I just had my CIO call me out of the blue, on a Friday morning to \"chat\" that is just the call you want to get", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/lyhava/i_just_had_my_cio_call_me_out_of_the_blue_on_a/"}, {"author": "None", "created_utc": 1637179704.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 364, "post_id": "qw7rsi", "score": 775, "subreddit": "ITCareerQuestions", "text": "\"I don\\u2019t think McDonald\\u2019s employees should be paid less, I just think IT should pay more, right?

I started my first IT job at 23. My beginning is probably different than most because I learned IT in the Marines and that\\u2019s what I did as my job. I\\u2019m leaving out a lot of detail and other things that may be relevant but I\\u2019m typing this up on my phone so whatever. If you have any questions or want me to elaborate more let me know! Anyways here we go.\\n\\n2016, $23/hour - Desktop Support Technician: I did all the basic things a desktop support tech would do. Active directory password resets, unlocks, security groups, home directory configurations and adding new computer objects to the domain. Also did hardware repairs and installed new desktops, laptops, tablets, IP iPhones, printers and scanners. The job was fun and unique because I was a contractor on a naval base. Got to see a lot of cool things and everybody I interacted with was nice and respectful. I never had an issue with someone yelling at me or freaking out about their problem. It was a requirement for me to have a Security+ certification and clearance. \\n\\n2018, $60k - Information Systems Security Officer: I learned so much in this job and was in way over my head and barely had half the experience or skills they were looking for. I didn\\u2019t have experience with Linux, auditing, SIEM, group policy, firewalls, database servers, license servers or any of the policy requirements, regulations or laws set forth by the various government agencies. I was apart of a team of about 7-8 who were completely responsible for nearly a dozen air-gapped networks. Each environment had specific software, operating systems and tools they had to use. Some things overlapped but learning the general layout of each network was difficult at first. The networks varied in size from 10 systems to over a 100. I had to do weekly audits of systems, brief new users on policies, responsibilities and procedures. Do system hardening and configuration using STIGs and SCAP scans. I used Ansible for Linux system configuration changes and updates. Patched and updated Windows and Linux. We had to evaluate system changes and how it effected the security of our networks. This job was a lot of googling, troubleshooting and reading on my own before I asked for help. Team members were helpful and I got along well with all of them. This was also when I was going to school for a degree in IT which I do have now. \\n\\n2019, $63k same job but just got a raise. I was becoming dependable and a solid member of the team. But I was becoming overtasked and there never seemed to be enough time to focus on a specific project because I was running around from lab to lab helping people with other problems and other projects. I could\\u2019ve stayed and worked later hours but I enjoy a work life balance. Although there was some times l would stay late or work on weekends for system upgrades and updates. \\n\\n2020, $66k - Got a a raise in December late in the year because of COVID. I came into work like normal during the entire pandemic. Most guys on my team had kids so they maybe came to work 2-3 days out of the week. I also lived the closest to the office too and was not particularly worried about catching it. This was also when I decided I wanted to leave this job because it was getting repetitive and I didn\\u2019t enjoy going to work anymore. Applied to new jobs to anything cybersecurity related. \\n\\n2021, $95k - Cybersecurity Analyst: This is a new job I started last month. I moved across the country for it. I\\u2019m still getting settled in here but I will be running vulnerability and SCAP scans, applying STIGs, patching and updating systems, creating new system baselines and generating  reports. \\n\\nI\\u2019m honestly surprised I have come this far so soon. I work hard but only when it\\u2019s required. Like I said before, I need the balance with work and other things in my life that I enjoy. I want to avoid the mental burnout of constantly learning and working nonstop. I\\u2019m not the smartest or most knowledgeable person about any topic but I\\u2019m a problem solver. I research and troubleshoot until I figure it out just like everybody else does.\\n\\nUPDATE: Thanks the support everyone! Here are some answers to questions that I have seen.\\n1. The first two jobs were in San Diego county. As you can guess, there are a lot of opportunities there because of the massive military presence. Only downside is the Cost of living. \\n2. The baseline requirement for working as a contractor is having an active secret clearance and a Sec+ this is probably the most important factor in my progression. I\\u2019m very fortunate to have obtained clearances. Needless to say I was the youngest contractor on my desktop support team which surprised a lot of them. \\n3. I only have two Certs and a degree. Network+ Security + and a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. Working on a Linux+ now.\\n4. My personal tip to getting a higher paying job is to find a new job every 2-3 years. If you stay at a company and don\\u2019t get a raise that outpaces the rate of inflation you\\u2019re losing money. Even if it\\u2019s the same job title and responsibilities.

It should take you at least 5-10 years to reach this goal, and it's OK if it changes over time.  If your goals stop after you get your first entry-level role, then that's where you'll stall until you decide what to do next.\\n\\nMost people who get stuck at helpdesk are there because they just don't know what to do next.  Networking?  Security?  Systems administration?  I don't know - someone tell me what to do!  But no one will - that's a decision that only you can make.  And your boss likely won't do it for you.\\n\\nThere's no defined path upward in the vast majority of IT roles - this is something you just have to do yourself.  \\n\\nAs an example - let's say your goal is to be a cloud architect.  Your plan to move forward might look like:\\n\\n- Get a CS degree\\n- Internship with a big company\\n- Entry-level role after graduation doing cloud admin work\\n- Look at Google/Azure certs to decide on a direction\\n- Cloud-centered position at an MSP or at a cloud provider\\n- Move to more advanced roles\\n- etc.\\n\\nThe further out you go the less well-defined the goals need to be since they could change along the way.  But as long as you have a defined path in your head, then **what you're doing today should be preparing you for what your next step should be**.  And if you don't know that next step, you're going to stall.  No one will tell you what to do if you can't decide for yourself. And you should ALWAYS have a \\\"next step\\\" until that next step is retirement.  \\n\\nAnd maybe your goal is, \\\"decide what specialty to do\\\" - that's completely valid, since that'll force you to focus on making that decision.  You'll pay attention to what's available, cross off things you don't like, make a short list of the ones you do, etc.  So it's still OK if you don't know exactly what you want to do, as long as your goal is to make that decision.

I went back to college after getting divorced in my late 30s and having to figure my life out again. Here are some of the reasons my co-workers who interviewed me decided I was the one to hire:\\n\\n\\\\- I admitted when I didn't know something during the interview. But then I went home, googled what they'd asked and wrote back with an e-mail what they wanted to know. This impressed both the IT team as well as HR.\\n\\n\\\\- I was pleasant to EVERYONE, even the assistant who was scheduling the interviews. She later told me that I was the only one who'd treated her with respect and she was so thrilled I was hired. This should be a no-brainer, but I guess not.\\n\\n\\\\- On my LinkedIn profile I leaned into my time as a stay at home mom, focusing on the soft skills I learned while at home with the kids: Planning, organizing, communicating, etc. The network engineer I took over from, who was also part of the interview process told me that he LOVED this on my resume and even called his wife over to read it. It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but you're not going to be working for everyone. Just one company.\\n\\n\\\\- I acknowledged that I still needed to learn a lot even though I had my CCNA and Associate's degree. I hadn't touched Palo Alto or Solarwinds. I showed that I was open to learning everything.\\n\\nBecause of this the company rewrote the position to fit me, acknowledging that I was still in training and they were happy for me to continue training while working for them. To quote my boss: \\\"They could train me the way they wanted me to be trained and I didn't come with any bad habits from previous jobs.\\\"\\n\\nI realize my company is one in a million, and I'm so thankful I found them.

Started in help desk in 2020, got into DevOps role in 2021, now the lead Infrastructure person at a SaaS Provider\\n\\n  \\n\\n- **Background:** Typical gamer story in which I built my own computers and am a tech enthusiast so \\u201ctech-savvy\\u201d, random major in Econ, random career in manufacturing for 5 years, wasn\\u2019t happy, thought about IT \\n- **Transition:** Finally took the dive to study in my evenings and get the A+,Net+,Sec+ between 2018-2020 (had major life things going on then too) while working full time \\n- **Career jump:** Took a paycut to start MSP as an L1, really uncomfortable early on since I never worked customer support or tech support for that matter. I grew really fast, learned a lot about Linux, networking, and VMs, got lots of commendations. I got bored, learned some Python, and after half a year, since they weren\\u2019t moving me up, I went looking for new opportunities and got some lateral move offers that I wasn\\u2019t happy with. So, I paused the search, got a minor promotion, and continued to pursue cloud certs AZ-900, AZ-104, AWS CCP in about 1.5 months time. I also familiarized myself with Ansible, Terraform, and Git as they were popular tools in the job hunt descriptions for Cloud Engineer/DevOps Engineer roles. \\n  \\n\\n### Current Company:\\n\\n- Through luck and perseverance, DevOps Engineer role at startup landed. I learned later on that I scored really high on the take-home assessment (I usually do, and probably why I landed my previous offers too, high CCAT tests), and they liked my personality and willingness to learn, despite my lack of experience. \\n- I thrive in the role, learning many DevOps tools more formally. Our director has been the mastermind behind most of the infrastructure, and I did a lot of the day to day work. Shorthanded (we\\u2019ve been looking to hire more, but struggling to find a good candidate), and having people again applauding me, so I took an opportunity to ask for a raise at half a year in and got 12% pretty easily. (I also went into the job market again and got offers so it gave me confidence) \\n- Due to unforeseen circumstances, my boss had to go so it\\u2019s been left up to me. We\\u2019re on good terms, but sad to see him go as he was someone I looked up to a lot. The CEO offered me a good bonus to stay on so sure, why not. New CTO has also been more hands on with me now \\n\\nIn my solo time, I have shown leadership that I am capable of and have taken a lot of ownership for the department and the future growth of it. While I am not the most technically adept person, I am very mindful of internal customers and the needs of the business. I am making changes to help with the onboarding process of others. I\\u2019m doing more than I ever was previously when I had my old director as a crutch, because I relied on seniority and authority to make decisions, now it\\u2019s mostly up to me so I\\u2019m forced to make those decisions. I still have a lot to learn, and I\\u2019m still at a toss up whether I\\u2019m better off as a lead/manager type or the technical person. I still prefer for my current stage to have a mentor but, nonetheless, the current opportunity granted to me is a way to improve my resume and continue growing during uncomfortable periods.\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\nAnd to those out there feeling that imposter syndrome, I feel ya. But honestly, that\\u2019s a good thing, we should feel like we\\u2019re the dumbest in the room so we can aspire to improve ourselves. If you\\u2019re like me as well, I've had both metrics showing me far above my peers and verbal praise from others so that reassures me.\\n\\nMy plans for now are to stabilize, minimize new projects and just keep the system going. I\\u2019m likely to stay on for the bonus but I am not sure where I\\u2019ll be come 2023. As far as technical learning topics for projects when I have more free time, I want to get to know more Git version control, containers, docker, kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, FOSS monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki).\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\n\\n#Tech Skill Advice\\n  \\n\\nIf you haven\\u2019t been able to tell, I\\u2019m just figuring things out as I go. I advocate for habit setting (I suggest reading the book Atomic Habits!) to keep improving through life (like setting aside time for studying, exercise, etc) but I also go through periods of high motivation and other times of giving myself the okay to relax. That means, in my free time, sometimes I work a lot for months, and other times, like recently, I was playing a LOT of Elden Ring (400 hours in 2 months).We\\u2019re all human and have different things to manage in our lives, so look out for yourself and set yourself reasonable expectations that keeps you going, that\\u2019s key, making things reasonably sustainable.\\n\\nOn the career focused subject, if you are still early into your career, certs are highly recommended as you have to make up for your lack of experience to make yourself look more appealing to employers. Find what seems like a reasonable next step in your career, and look for certs for that. Just starting? CompTIA Trifecta. Network/System Admin/Engineer? CCNA. Cloud? AWS SAA, GCP ACE, Azure Administrator. Etc. I would recommend setting a habit of daily studying 1-2 hours a day, maybe more during your non-work days. These certs will give you more opportunities to interview as you get through resume filters, and, if you\\u2019re able to practice and lab, will be useful if you do end up using it. Iin honesty, the most useful cert for me has been Network+ just because in my entirety as a tech enthusiast, I never exposed myself much to basic networking.\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\n\\nAt this point for myself, everything I learn is on the job training, but I do want to pursue the CKA as I do use Kubernetes and need a better idea on how to implement things. For the most part though, I think certs aren\\u2019t as important as you skill up.\\u00a0\\n\\n#Job Hunt Tips\\n\\n###Resumes\\n\\nI looked at job descriptions and what tools they were looking for, then tailor my resume to that. Even with no experience and my first job into IT, I sprinkled a lot of those tools and terms into my resume to get past automated filters. I practiced them a little bit to be able to speak to them, so like VMs, Ansible, Terraform, I knew very basic things from a few hours of labbing and had them on my resume.\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\n\\nLess important in IT I think, but work in metrics if you\\u2019ve got them.\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\n\\nHere\\u2019s some examples from my help desk role:\\n\\n  \\n\\n- Technical Skills: IPv4 addresses, subnets, LAN, VLANs, WAN, firewalls access controls, packet inspection, DNS, DHCP, VPN; VSS backups, CHKDSK, SFC; ACL, user permissions; virsh, VMs, VMware, Hyper-V; iSCSI, SMB, NFS, NAS shares; ZFS, zpool; Ubuntu; SSH, CLI/CMD troubleshooting; Linux, Windows, VMware logs; hardware troubleshooting, diagnostics, migrations, & deployment; Salesforce Service Cloud \\n- Record actions thoroughly, summarize, and provide guided next steps, using formatting such as code blocks and images to improve coworker parsing, warranting commendation from peers on case ownership. Effectively improving time to case close by 50% and increasing personal case bandwidth by 69%.\\u00a0 \\n- Maintain service level agreements (SLA) by handling 200% increase over average tech workflow while maintaining over 80% scheduled call volume adherence\\u00a0 \\n  \\n  \\n\\n### Applying to Opportunities\\nI\\u2019d say don\\u2019t be afraid to do different things depending on the roles. I did some of the numbers games and just had a general IT resume that I mass applied with LinkedIn or Indeed\\u2019s easy apply options. I threw in a general enough cover letter as well.\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\n\\nThat said, if I found a position I really think I fit well with, I took more time to modify my resume and cover letter. In fact, most of those I got through multiple interviews came from these local companies that I catered my resume more towards as there was likely a smaller pool of applicants, I made myself to surely stand out.\\n\\n  \\n\\n###Interviews\\nPractice STAR and also work on confidence (yes, tell yourself *I'VE GOT THIS*). Don\\u2019t be afraid to say you don\\u2019t know, or to ask for clarification. I conduct interviews now, and I\\u2019ll say, we\\u2019re not looking for gotchas. I understand you\\u2019re probably nervous and you don\\u2019t know a lot about our platform, so I will try to start with a more easy and relaxed conversation before diving into anything too technical. I want you to be able to convey your personal career experiences well and to see if that matches well with what my company needs. I personally am looking more for someone who knows how to look into things than any specific skill, even if I do ask some technical questions, I\\u2019m trying to gauge a person\\u2019s thought process and communication skills most of the time.\\u00a0\\n\\n  \\n#Hope that helps everyone! \\nI am so grateful that I took this career leap. I find so much more identity in IT and am very fortunate to be where I am today in such a short time frame, but there\\u2019s been a good amount of work put into that to make me eligible for those opportunities that have been out there.\\u00a0\"", "title": "In less than 2 years, from 40k/year help desk to 125k/year DevOps Team Lead", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/v0gnip/in_less_than_2_years_from_40kyear_help_desk_to/"}, {"author": "Rob_Aught", "created_utc": 1685976414.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 188, "post_id": "141gwmp", "score": 669, "subreddit": "ITCareerQuestions", "text": "\"First, my bona fides. I've been working in technology since the dotcom boom and bust. That means I was around for the financial crash as well. I've seen this industry get hit twice specifically and also caught up with the general downturn that hit during the 2008 Financial Crash and the initial 2020 COVID downturn. Most of my career has been spent in some sort of leadership capacity.\\n\\nI graduated college with a Liberal Arts degree. Make your jokes. I taught myself how to code back when there wasn't a ton of websites, training programs or boot camps. A big change from when I started to today is that at least when people tell me they want to learn how to code there are plenty of resources to help get them started.\\n\\nI've led teams across the US and the Globe. If it is an emerging tech market in the world I've probably had a team there. I've also led almost every kind of team from development, testing, project managers, support, business analysis, and some I'm probably forgetting. I've done and seen just about every angle of this industry.\\n\\nI've been reading through some of the threads and what I see are a lot of symptoms of the over-hiring craze of the last few years. People flocked to social media and fed everyone a bunch of lies about tech. They made FAANG's seem like the norm but FAANG's are NOT the tech industry. They don't represent normal pay (which is still good, but not the crazy rates of \\\"Big Tech\\\") They made it seem like you could do remote work forever. Fun fact: Since I started working this is the 3rd time we've done \\\"Remote work is great and we're never going back to the office\\\". This is cyclical.\\n\\nTruth is you can find a good paying job that is entry level, that will pay the US median salary or better at ENTRY LEVEL. I don't think people appreciate what that means. Plenty of jobs in the US pay less than 6 figures even if you work it for 20 years! If you can get into programming you'll be making 6 figures in 5 years even if you live in Podunk, Alabama. Some places will pay you that much at entry level though usually in places where the cost of living will eat your paycheck so fast it will feel like poverty.\\n\\nI see a lot of people toiling away at help desk complaining about not being able to move up. Here's something everyone needs to know whether you are help desk, a coder, a tester, or whatever.\\n\\nThis industry has a ton of gatekeeping and the people who get \\\"tapped on the shoulder\\\" to do something else are exceedingly rare. The people who tend to move up the fastest study and practice on their own, research on their own, find mentors, network, and take every opportunity to practice and learn new skills.\\n\\nYou can be a success and you can move up but you have to put in the work, you have to build a support system, and you absolutely must be excited about continuous learning.\\n\\nThe truth is this industry is not for everyone. I never tell people to learn to code because it pays well. It pays well because it's so hard to find people with the aptitude for it. You have to be able to look at the world a certain way, to figure out complex puzzles in your head and then translate that into code. This is damn hard to learn if you're not already an abstract thinker, which is why we see so many math degrees in this industry.\\n\\nWe're also flooded with boot camp grads who learned mostly front-end languages sold a lie about their marketability because, once again, people thought it was what FAANG's wanted while we have an ongoing shortage of Java, C#, and C++ developers. There's actually a COBOL shortage but I wouldn't advise anyone to learn that right now.\\n\\nThings are bad now but they will get better. Tech is not going away. We went a little nuts.

Anything from side-channel attacks to large-scale DDoS\\u2019 - stuff is insecure because stuff communicates with other stuff. Communication can be hard understand and even harder to define (let alone secure). I know this is a very vague statement, but it\\u2019s one of the core, fundamental concepts of cybersecurity. \\n\\nThe second most basic thing about cybersecurity you need to understand - \\u201chacking\\u201d (I hate that word) as it\\u2019s known is not some bond-villain type activity. It\\u2019s intentionally mis-using something that already exists in a way that introduces a security flaw into the environment. Sometimes the right circumstances line up and this flaw can be leveraged into something, but sometimes it can\\u2019t.  \\n\\nI split up my resources into offensive-based and defensive-based because it\\u2019s important for you to understand that while each of these groups are individually important, each knowledge area is not as effective without the an understanding of the other one. \\n\\nOne other thing to note -  Certifications are great, but you need to de-couple the idea that certifications=knowledge/skills in this field. There are certainly certifications that break out of that mold, but for the most part, this holds true. I\\u2019ve ordered them in the order in which I used/learned with these resources, so you can follow-along directly in order (if you want to). I learned offense first, so that\\u2019s the way I\\u2019m laying it out here.\\n\\n\\nOffensive-Based: \\n\\t\\n\\nI started my career in InfoSec by studying for the most basic, foundational certification: The Security+. This is the best beginner-level cert that says \\u201cI know something about security.\\u201d \\n\\nI learned by going through Professor Messer\\u2019s entire course, and I felt pretty ready after I went through it all. Here\\u2019s the [link to his Sec+ course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnVhoAaL4B6aMFDQ8_gdxAy)\\n\\nNow, lets get into some practical stuff. OverTheWire. These are war-games, or CTF\\u2019s - challenges designed to test your practical ability in security, but also designed to help you learn new things. CTF\\u2019s are the *absolute best* way I\\u2019ve found to learn security. Here\\u2019s the [link to OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames) in case Google is down. If you get stuck, here are some [helpful write-up\\u2019s](https://github.com/USCGA/writeups/tree/master/overthewire). \\n\\nDo them in this order: \\n\\n* Bandit\\n* Leviathan \\n* Natas\\n* Narnia. \\n\\nAt this point, you should be set to start with the books and Hacking Labs. \\n\\n* [Penetration Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Penetration-Testing-Hands-Introduction-Hacking/dp/1593275641/ref=pd_sbs_14_5/146-0067845-2391459?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1593275641&pd_rd_r=8f4e9a76-4772-4fea-8bef-3ba03a919d0c&pd_rd_w=aScZ0&pd_rd_wg=ZjfLp&pf_rd_p=52b7592c-2dc9-4ac6-84d4-4bda6360045e&pf_rd_r=A8M77QGHZ4RP6REKNX7M&psc=1&refRID=A8M77QGHZ4RP6REKNX7M) (Book, Follow-along labs)\\n\\n\\n* [Hacking, the Art of Exploitation](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1QLA6PNP0LK7S&keywords=hacking+the+art+of+exploitation&qid=1573663911&sprefix=hacking+the+art%2Caps%2C212&sr=8-3) (2nd Edition, Book, follow-along labs)\\n\\n\\nAt this point, I\\u2019d recommend going for another certification - CEH. Once you have the CEH, you\\u2019re ready to move into more practical-based certifications. [Here's what I used to learn and practice the CEH:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNvNZOT1rEc&list=PLYmNa3dW770L7qLx5vINs6O19NNf9DTWE)\\n\\nNow, lets get into some more practical exploitation. PentesterLabs focuses a bit more on WebApp stuff, but I\\u2019ve found its the best intro-environment (as it is relatively scripted scenarios, and you don\\u2019t have to do as much recon). They're fairly explanatory, and will walk you through the solution if you get stuck. \\n\\n* [PentesterLabs](https://pentesterlab.com)\\n\\n\\nNext, lets get into HackTheBox (Exploitable virtual machines, ranging in difficulty. You\\u2019re going in mostly blind here, so you have to do your own recon and enumeration): [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu) \\n\\nHere are some helpful write-ups (Written Explanations): \\n\\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/Hackplayers/hackthebox-writeups)\\n\\n* [0xRick Webiste](https://0xrick.github.io/)\\n\\nAlso, there\\u2019s some super awesome [video explanations by IppSec](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA)\\n\\n\\nAfter you get through most of these, you should be set to start on your OSCP. The OSCP contains a course (Penetration Testing with Kali), a lab environment (~50-60 vulnerable boxes), and a practical lab test at the end. [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp)\\n\\nAfter you\\u2019ve completed the OSCP, then you have enough knowledge to continue directly down the cert path, and the courses (in combination with the certs) put out by Offensive Security contain enough good content to where you don\\u2019t have to study other resources. The certification path from here on out splits into two different areas: Technical, and management. \\n\\n* Technical: \\n\\t  * OSCE (OSCP 2, basically)\\n\\t  * OSWE (OSCP but for web exploitation)\\n\\t  * OSEE (OSCP 3, really fucking hard). \\n\\nIf you\\u2019re at this point, getting past the OSEE, you can pretty much walk into any offensive-based job, slap you\\u2019re cert on the table, and they\\u2019ll hire you. You don\\u2019t need my help anymore here. \\n\\nNow, here's the management path: \\n\\n* Management: \\n\\t  * CISSP\\n\\t  * PMP\\n\\t  * MBA\\n\\nHaving the technical background of the OSCP, plus a CISSP, PMP, and MBA would create an extremely potent executive - one who can understand the technical details and risk, and who then could translate that into verbiage that other executives could understand. \\n\\n\\nSo, you\\u2019re overall standard security offensive certification path should look something like: \\n\\n* Security+\\n* CEH\\n* OSCP\\n* OSCE\\n* OSWE\\n* OSEE\\n\\nOR\\n\\n* Security+\\n* CEH\\n* OSCP\\n* CISSP\\n* PMP\\n* MBA\\n\\nNow, for the Defensive-based side. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are a ton of different things you can do on the defensive side. The path here is a bit less defined because you can specialize in each of these areas with out ever really touching the other ones. But I think these are the most important skills as a defender, so I\\u2019ll break it up into three smaller chunks. For the most part, defender/Blue-team concepts draw from these skills, I\\u2019ve setup the courses in order, as some of these skills may feed into other areas. \\n\\n\\nIR: \\n\\n* [Computer Forensics and IR](https://www.amazon.com/Incident-Response-Computer-Forensics-Third/dp/0071798684/ref=pd_sbs_14_39?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0071798684&pd_rd_r=3ce06c82-341d-46ce-91ca-f6348bca322a&pd_rd_w=yp3kd&pd_rd_wg=Yn9m9&pf_rd_p=52b7592c-2dc9-4ac6-84d4-4bda6360045e&pf_rd_r=ZDS354HAG0FG8PG1EP8Z&psc=1&refRID=ZDS354HAG0FG8PG1EP8Z) - This is the hole grail of IR.

Although, after reading some stories that others have gone through before finally landing a job, I consider myself fortunate. It wasn't until I changed my resume that I began to receive responses back from employers. I went in thinking I had a fantastic resume, and it was...for retail management. My resume showed that I had years of management experience, special projects, and metrics that highlighted my strengths as a leader. The problem was it wasn't geared towards an IT position.\\n\\nOver the course of applying for all these positions I was also studying for my A+ exam. While watching Professor Messer I stumbled on a youtube channel called KevtechIT. He has a ton of content, but what helped me the most was his 14 part video series that walks you through basic IT job functions; Downloading virtualbox to mess around with Server 2016, Active Directory, Group Policy, RDP, etc...all of which can be done in a single weekend. He also shows you an IT resume template, which if you follow his videos you can technically use and send to prospective employers.

It is mainly intended for people trying to start an IT career with mostly free or very cheap resources available on the internet. It's inspired by a good friend of mine who dropped out of high school to go to work in IT.  He never attended any college but now works as a cloud architect for NASA. \\n\\nEDIT: Many people have asked for a pathway to **cloud engineering**. The best one I've found is detailed here in [this post explaining what to do to get a cloud job](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/xa87x9/sys_admin_to_cloud_possible/).\\n\\nTo start a career in cybersecurity you should be aiming to eventually get hired into a position as a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst. [A SOC analyst position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5bIhaZOSys&ab_channel=EyeonTech) gives you some insight into a whole range of different information security problems and practices. You'll see incoming recon and attacks, your organization's defenses and responses, and the attacker's counter responses. You'll get experience using a Security Information and Event Management system AKA [SIEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAaRA4ctRL4&ab_channel=CyberGrayMatter). You'll become familiar with all of the security tools in place and start to figure out what works and what doesn't. You'll learn the workflow of a security team and what the more senior engineers do to protect the enterprise. SOC analyst jobs are not entry level [(see this discussion)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityCareerAdvice/comments/s319l5/entry_level_cyber_security_jobs_are_not_entry/) but rather a mid-level career goal. After a couple of years in the SOC, you'll probably have a much better idea about your own interests and the path you want to pursue in your career.\\n\\nHere's how you get there:\\n\\n**Step 0** (optional): If you have absolutely no tech experience whatsoever you may first have to try to get a job in retail or the service industry that is technology adjacent. Such jobs would include GeekSquad at Best Buy, cell phone sales or technician at a provider like Verizon or T-mobile, or cabling and rack and stack at a commercial data center (smart hands).  My first job after college was in data processing for a cell phone billing company. I did QA for huge stacks of paper cell phone bills, it really sucked. I got fired when they caught me using company resources to look for a better job. It was good enough to help me get my second job which was helpdesk at a large ISP.  \\n\\nIf this is where you're starting, getting the [CompTia A+ certification](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) might be really helpful for you.  This is considered to be one of the best introductory certifications a new technical track IT worker can obtain.  Thanks to redditor u/Average_Down, who put together a really thorough [study guide for CompTia A+.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/16gsgek/how_i_passed_the_a_2201101/?share_id=vGac3lPruy2sUkhTDZw7i&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) \\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\n**Step 1:** Get the CompTia A+ (optional) and Network+ certifications. You MUST understand IPv4 networking inside and out, I can't stress that enough. Professor Messer videos are great and free: [Professor Messer A+ series,](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnOmvg5UGVenB_qQgsh01uC) [Professor Messer Network+ series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnlCJiCrOYuRYb6cne864a7G)\\n\\nSubnetting is a topic that gives a lot of people trouble but can be important in understanding network architecture.  Berry Smith's video series on subnetting:\\n- [IPv4 basic overview (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moXYJ1gU47A)\\n- [IP addresses vs. phone numbers (Part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2be4QfdgNKg)\\n- [Classes of IP addresses (Part 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBjZs4FajhA)\\n- [Public/Private IP addresses and subnet masks (Part 4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peRsC0lZpUU)\\n- [What is subnetting and why to subnet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yz3FV8WliU)\\n- [How to Subnet a Network Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOOPP-ceToc)\\n- [How to Subnet a Network Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMmW3dE8160)\\n\\nMike Meyers has about the best all in one Network + book out right now, you can get that from [Amazon for about $40](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Network-Certification-N10-008-Comptia/dp/1264269056). You can also check out Mike Meyers' channel on Youtube, he has a lot of Network+ videos as well.\\n\\nHere is a great post [with a comprehensive list of study resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/i7hx4t/master_list_i_compiled_and_ranked_every_major/) for CompTia exams, thanks to u/canadian_sysadmin for this great compilation!\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n\\n**Step 2:** Start learning some basic Linux. The majority of non-desktop business computing is done on a UNIX type platform, this will not change anytime soon.  This is by far one of the best investments of your time you can make, very solid 4/5 Linux skills can make an IT worker millions of dollars over the course of an IT career, no exaggeration.  People, that is life changing money. \\n\\nThe [Bandit wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is an excellent exercise to start learning concepts and commands.\\n\\nThe free online version of the book [The Linux Command Line](https://linuxcommand.org/index.php) by William Shotts is also a great resource for Linux newcomers. \\n\\nFor those looking for a good Linux systems administration book, I'd highly recommend \\\"Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook\\\" by Evi Nemeth, et al. The information is presented in a way that is comprehensible to regular people. You can get a [used copy of the fourth edition for about $10.00](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Linux-System-Administration-Handbook/dp/0131480057/ref=sr_1_3?crid=O6HE618TLM8X&keywords=evi+nemeth&qid=1661595001&s=books&sprefix=evi+nemeth%2Cstripbooks%2C49&sr=1-3). The second edition got me through my first three jobs back in the day.\\n\\nIf you're more of an audio or visual learner freecodecamp.org has some high quality free intro Linux courses on Youtube:\\n\\n[Linux Operating System - Crash Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROjZy1WbCIA&t=73s)\\n\\n[Introduction to Linux \\u2013 Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWbUDq4S6Y8) \\n\\nThe websites [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com/), \\n [Tecmint.com](https://www.tecmint.com/free-online-linux-learning-guide-for-beginners/), and [Linuxpath.org](https://linuxpath.org/) are all exceptional online resources for learning Linux.\\n\\nFor the DIY crowd this post has some great instructions for buildout of a Linux SA homelab.  The instructions are sound and there are helpful hints in the comments.  \\n[Learn to be a Linux Sysadmin task list by u/IConrad](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/h16i0j/how_do_i_learn_to_be_a_linux_sysadmin/)\\n\\nFinally, [Linux From Scratch (LFS)](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own customized Linux system entirely from source.\\n\\n&nbsp;  \\n  \\n**Step 3:** Start looking for [helpdesk or tech support jobs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4jgQJG6eMDMRl8zfCJUfMSP1tMAcTD-N) online. You have to do a year or two here to get some hands-on experience on your resume and begin to build your confidence with your technical skills. If you've had great student internships from a degree program or you have experience from military service there's a good chance you'll be able to skip this step.  If you don't have that or any other previous IT experience then starting at the bottom is pretty much unavoidable. \\n\\nIf you can, use your local community college career center to get some help with a job search or maybe an internship.  Many community colleges maintain relationships with local employers and can act as a potential pipeline to an IT job.  The career center people often know who's hiring and when and they can help you with your resume as well. This is also a good time to consider taking a programming class or two, preferably in python. Community colleges can be great for that, Mark Zuckerberg learned to program at one before enrolling at Harvard and he ended up doing pretty well for himself.  If you can't take a class at community college there are a few free reputable self-paced python classes out there:\\n- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python free online book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc)\\n- [Harvard CS50\\u2019s Intro to Python \\u2013 Full Free University Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4)\\n- [Free Python Programming Course - University of Helsinki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/vm78c0/python_mooc_helsinki_is_an_excellent_free/)\\n\\nThe helpdesk job may only pay $20 - $25 an hour or perhaps a bit less but it's only for a year or maybe two years at most, then up and out.  Unless you are completely satisfied with mid-level wages you have to continue to improve your skills and embrace greater job responsibilities.  A lot of people get stuck at this helpdesk stage for six, seven, eight years and it's a career killer.  Why is that?  \\n\\nTwo reasons.  First, when hiring managers see 3 - 4 years of helpdesk on your resume they begin to assume you have no professional ambition or drive to embrace greater industry responsibility.  Once you cross the 5 year mark that assumption increases and you may not be considered for higher level positions at all by people that think all you're good for is entry-level helpdesk work.  \\n\\nThe second reason is that you risk becoming a Lotus Eater.  In Greek mythology, the Lotus Eaters were a race of people living on an island dominated by the lotus tree.  The lotus fruits and flowers were the primary food of the island and acted as a narcotic, causing the inhabitants to sleep in peaceful apathy.  Sometimes visitors would find the island. After they ate the lotus fruit they would forget their home and loved ones and long only to stay with their fellow Lotus Eaters. Those who ate the plant never cared to return home or move on with their lives.  \\n\\nSmall and medium business owners love to bring on inexperienced new IT hires for $20 an hour and then work them like dogs.  In a year or so, they give a raise of a dollar or two an hour.  But something unusual happens.  For the first time, the IT worker can pay all (or almost all) of their bills in the same month.  Then when they get home every night they're too tired to study for certs or work on upskilling.  Instead they play COD or Fortnite for a while, then fall asleep.  Then at work the boss decides to improve morale with a pizza party or a smartphone raffle.  Everyone feels loved and keeps working hard to make the company owner rich.  And oh my gosh, it's just so much effort to look for another job.  These helpdeskers have become trapped in complacency, content to work as hard as they can to enrich others while ignoring the potential of their own futures.        \\n\\nOne of the things I did right in my career was to minimize my time on helpdesk, I was only there for nine months.  Come up with a game-plan for your own career.  Don't become a Lotus Eater and stay out of the IT version of quicksand.\\n**DON'T GET STUCK ON HELPDESK.**  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n  \\n**Step 4:** Get the [CompTia Security+ certification](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnjucQ18QzbCrv-er2zH7d9) while you're looking for your first tech support job or shortly after. Every IT job has a security component now so think of it like basic training in the military.  Everyone needs to go through it.  You should be able to do the cert in just a couple months if you focus and use a [good Security+ study plan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/13vovka/resources_that_helped_me_passed_security/)  \\n\\nThis is also a good time to start building increased awareness of contemporary information security issues.  Some top resources:\\n\\n- [Top 10 learning and practice platforms to build up confidence in cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/14q7jhn/top_10_learning_and_practice_platforms_to_build/)\\n- [Archived webcasts from the SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/webcasts/)\\n- [Archived webcasts from Black Hills Information Security](https://www.youtube.com/@BlackHillsInformationSecurity/videos)\\n- [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/)\\n- [Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/)\\n- [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/)\\n- [Social Media Recommendations in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/zc9iaq/im_looking_for_some_recommendations_of_who_to/)\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n  \\n**Step 5:** Once you get that helpdesk job, try to do every security related task you can. Ask the senior engineers questions when you get a chance and if they are working maintenance windows ask to shadow them as they work. Eventually they may start giving you some of the more routine tasks and you can add those to your resume.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Step 6:** Attend [**Bsides conferences**](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage) (very cheap), there is almost certainly one within a couple hours of you.  Live cybersecurity conferences are making a comeback in the post-pandemic world and they can be very helpful for raising your profile and learning about contemporary issues in security.  More importantly these conferences often have sessions dedicated to resume reviews and cybersecurity career counseling where you can get real industry professionals to help you.  Go with a friend or a classmate and split expenses, it's worth your time. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Step 7:** Try to join a local hackers group similar to [NoVA Hackers](https://novahackers.com/) or [Dallas Hackers](https://www.meetup.com/dallas-hackers-association/).\\n\\nIt's possible to get your first security job from contacts made at a local hacker meetup.  Physical pentester [Jek Hyde](https://www.scmagazine.com/news/sophie-pingor-breaking-into-walmart-for-the-sake-of-security) got their first pentest engagement from a Dallas Hackers associate and never looked back.  [Hacker groups like these](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Ftechnology%2Fa24676415%2Fdallas-hackers%2Fa) are for knowledge enrichment and community building, not illegal activity.  As long as you check your ego at the door there's no reason to be intimidated.  \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Step 8:** Network with everyone you can at security conferences and in your hackers group. Professional networking is extremely important and if you want to be a Red Teamer (and that's most of you, right?) it's absolutely necessary. Pentesters are a tight-knit bunch where everyone knows everyone. The best way in to this highly selective group is to know your shit, then act like [Case in Neuromancer](https://williamgibson.fandom.com/wiki/Case), find yourself a [Dixie Flatline](https://williamgibson.fandom.com/wiki/Dixie_Flatline) and impress the hell out of them.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Step 9:** After you get those certs and some technical work experience, apply for every SOC analyst position you can. It might be difficult to move, but you might have to consider moving to a city that's a tech hub because that's where the jobs are. Seattle, San Francisco and NYC are all outrageously expensive so consider some up and coming tech cities like Dallas, Raleigh NC, Nashville or Austin. Mastercard's infosec dept. is out of St. Louis now. KPMG has a huge facility in Orlando. \\n\\nPost-pandemic there are more WFH jobs available so if you don't want to move you could concentrate on those, though it might take a bit longer.  Competition for WFH jobs can be insane with openings often getting flooded with hundreds of low-merit applications.  If WFH is your goal you will likely need to be very patient, especially if you're just getting into cybersecurity.  You're probably better off getting an office based job first to build your familiarity with security operations, then looking for WFH once you're an experienced infosec worker.  To check on the geographical availability of cybersecurity jobs take a look at the [CyberSeek Heat Map](https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html) for open cybersecurity positions.    \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Step 10:** Keep applying until you get that SOC analyst job. Make sure your resume has lots of keywords on it that reference your certs, technical skills, hardware and software you've used, etc. This is to beat automated scanners and ensure that your resume is actually seen by a person.  Use lots of details in your work experience on your resume.  It's not enough to say you used a technology, you have to say what you did with it and what it did for the business.  Try to use [STAR format](https://resumegenius.com/blog/resume-help/star-method-resume) when revising your resume, that will also help with talking points during interviews.   Competition for SOC jobs can be fierce so use your resume to try to stand out and make sure you get noticed and become a candidate for interviews.  When you start applying for SOC jobs you might also want to do [some homelab exercises](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/10cnk8h/need_to_gain_cybersecurity_experience_for_an/) to improve your chances of getting interviewed and/or landing the job.\\n\\nBack in 2015 when I was hired for my first security role most candidates only needed a year or two of helpdesk experience and the Security+ to make them legit contenders for SOC roles.  In 2024 competition has become very stiff for these jobs with many people applying to them from cybersecurity degree programs and bootcamps.  Hiring managers for SOC positions often have their pick of dozens of applicants.  It still might be possible to land a SOC analyst role with a year or two of industry experience and just the CompTia Network+ and Security+ certs.  However, an applicant that wants to be a very strong candidate for SOC might also want to consider obtaining Cisco's [CCNA certification](https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/) to demonstrate additional IP networking expertise as well as the [CompTia CySA+](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/search/?q=CySA%2B&restrict_sr=1&t=all) certification.  These credentials can help generate the interviews necessary to obtain a SOC job by helping a candidate stand out from the competition.  Some good learning resources that might be worth checking out:\\n- [David Bombal's free CCNA course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxZpopqhKk8&list=PLhfrWIlLOoKPc2RecyiM_A9nf3fUU3e6g)\\n- [An excellent CCNA study plan from r/CCNA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/14ohsa8/comment/jqdjk04/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\n- [Andrei Ciorba's free CySA+ course](https://youtu.be/IGihuL5clDs?list=PLMYSjEaGLw_vGxGsAIUgmkbEm52QR02tx&t=48)       \\n\\nOnce you start landing interviews it's a good idea to start practicing for them. \\nThanks to u/bcjh for posting this [guide to interviewing for cybersecurity jobs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberSecurityJobs/comments/11uzvay/dummies_full_guide_and_tips_on_getting_interviews/)\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n  \\n**Step 11:** When you finally get that SOC job go out and celebrate.  Guess what, you're an information security professional!\\n\\nA SOC analyst job should pay from $60K - $80K. You'll stay there for a year or two and get a couple more advanced certs like CISSP, CCSP, OSCP, or eCPPT and then leave for a new job making $80 to $100K.  After 5 or 6 years in the IT/cybersecurity industry with some focus and hard work you should be at $100K+. From there you should be able to map out your own path to $200K, $300K, whatever.\\n\\nSomething to keep in mind is the salary level you're shooting for. $100K still puts you in the top 20% of salaried workers in the US and the top 10% of workers on the planet. Companies do not give these jobs away. You have to prove yourself over and over. It's tough, but probably not nearly as tough as being a first responder, ER nurse, long haul trucker, or inner city fifth grade teacher. You can do it if you simply refuse to quit. Good luck!\\n\\nThe program above is mainly for people that are starting from absolute scratch and using no resources beyond the Internet. If you're actually in some sort of formal degree program I'd also highly recommend at least one programming class, preferably in python. Being able to automate tasks is an invaluable skill as a SOC analyst and will set you apart from those that can't.  \\n\\nAnd since we're on the subject, allow me to give a word of advice to those of you actually enrolled in a degree program.  It's great that you're putting effort into getting your associate degree or bachelor's degree or whatever it is you're getting but you should understand that on its own, a degree will not guarantee a job offer.  In fact, doing the minimum necessary to graduate like showing up for class and turning in homework assignments will almost guarantee that you will be waiting for a job after graduation for quite some time.  It's 2024 and the entry level of the IT market is fiercely competitive now.  You have to distinguish yourself outside of the classroom as much as possible to have a reasonable expectation of getting a job once you complete all your coursework.  How to do this?  What matters most to hiring managers is that you can demonstrate IT skills and problem solving abilities.  What are the best ways to demonstrate such skills?\\n- Internships.  By far the best way to demonstrate problem solving skills and talents is to use them in a professional atmosphere and internships are the main way to do this.  Make getting an internship a very high priority from your first day of school.\\n- Presenting technical topics at a conference like B-sides, students do this all the time.\\n- Earning professional IT certs like Network+, Sec+, CCNA, even OSCP\\n- Volunteer for an [open-source project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects/)\\n- Join a CTF team\\n- Attend one or more [hackathons](https://tips.hackathon.com/article/how-to-find-the-best-hackathons-right-now)\\n- Create, join, or attend a Leetcode club\\n- Bug bounties or vuln hunting, this can make your reputation and get you paid\\n- Pick up some 1099 work on Upwork or Fiverr\\n- Do the cloud resume challenge (see below)\\n- Use your university career center to help you with your jobs search\\n\\nMost of all, work on your google-fu.  If any of the above sound appealing, start googling away.    \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Step 12:**  For people who are interested in focusing more on cloud engineering or DevOps than cybersecurity [this post has a lot of good info](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/xa87x9/sys_admin_to_cloud_possible/) on how to plan a transition.\\n\\n[The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/w4jvb2/build_something_real_the_cloud_resume_challenge/) could be a really good way for people trying to get cloud jobs to acquire and show off cloud skills to potential employers.  A lot of people seem to have used it successfully for this purpose, including u/rishabkumar7 who documented his progress in a [series of Youtube videos.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/130a439/finally_documented_my_attempt_at_the_aws_cloud/)    \\n\\nOne excellent option for beginners learning AWS is this [cloud training class by Adrian Cantrill.](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03) At $40 for the class the financial risk is minimal and learning a lot about cloud is becoming essential for technical IT workers.  The course is 75 hours and assumes pretty much no prior technical knowledge beyond basic computer literacy.

People that have had significant previous technical IT experience could probably get there in six months.  Most people that may only have a bachelors degree or a year or less of IT work experience will probably need closer to nine months to a year to complete it.\\n  \\nThere are a lot of roadmaps to DevOps and SRE jobs out there but I think this one is pretty comprehensive: [Step by step guide for DevOps, SRE or any other Operations Role in 2023](https://roadmap.sh/devops)\\n\\nIn a now classic post from 2019, u/lottacloudmoney recounts his initial foray into Cloud Engineering.

It's been a road with ups and downs but as of last week it has culminated in the biggest salary of my life and the way for my wife and I to dig out of debt and start putting down roots. This is my story and, I hope, an inspiration for others who might need reassurance that you can make it, regardless of your location or experience.\\n\\nAs I said above, IT and computers were a hobby for me in between various directionless retail and call center jobs. After my first child was born in 2015, my wife and I decided that we could live on a single income if I agreed to go back to school. I researched WGU, figured it was the cheapest and fastest way to a degree, and enrolled in June of 2016 in their Bachelors of IT program. A lot of people don't take to remote learning - but I did, and I was able to graduate in the summer of 2018, figuring the degree (nd my A+, Net+, Sec+, and other CompTIA certs gained in the process) would open up a lot of opportunities.\\n\\nIt... really didn't. My first few interviews went nowhere and I ended up starting off with contract work, imaging and cleaning laptops for a school system for $10 an hour. It was a 5 week contract and I had to cut it short because my second child was born. But I kept applying, and in September of 2018 I had my first full-time job in IT:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**September 2018: Level 1 Help Desk, MSP, $12/hour, eventually $17/hour.** This was a real trial-by-fire position: I was hired on alongside 3 other techs, all of which either quit or were fired by the end of October. It involved a lot of travel and a lot more of the physical aspect of IT - in my first week I was underneath a county courthouse pulling cable and hauling a network closet worth of equipment up a five story walk-up. It also exposed me to a lot of varied office setups, hardware and software systems, and doing vendor management. I cannot recommend more strongly spending at least 6 months in a high-volume MSP. It will teach you a lot and help you immensely in your time management and troubleshooting skills.\\n\\nBut don't stay long. The pay is low ($12 starting, $14 after 90 days, $17 after a year), the ability to advance is probably limited, and you *will* burn out. If you aren't the owner or one of the most senior techs, you're going to be overworked and underpaid. I did begin work on my Master's at WGU - first in Data Analytics (stopped after a semester because I realized it wasn't for me) and then in the Managment track (Edit: Masters in IT Management) starting in November 2019. After about 18 months at the MSP, I was recruited by a staffing agency and left for...\\n\\n**February 2020: Level 3 Help Desk, Construction Firm, $50,000/year.** I and three other techs were responsible for the Southeast region of the construction company, covering a seven state region. The first week or two were uneventful - and then COVID hit. We had to scramble to prep the entire firm to work from home and spin up our new Zoom culture. This was a real trial by fire for me in terms of project management and it inspired me to accelerate my degree and finish in October of 2020. COVID also helped my family reprioritize and begin to more tightly budget and reign in our debt.\\n\\nThis degree, I think was the real key to my advancement. I immediately started to see upticks in my recruitment calls and interview requests. Just 3 months after completing the degree, I accepted another new position...\\n\\n**January 2021: IT Manager, Non-Profit Organization, $65,000/year.** The pay increase was the main draw of this job change, especially as in our area the median *household* income is around $33,000 a year - this job put us at over triple that amount with our combined salaries.  It did involve a 45 (and on some days, 120) minute commute, but this is something you end up having to do when you live in an area with under 100,000 people in it and the towns are spread apart.\\n\\nHowever, this position was not what I expected. What was sold as a basic management position very quickly ran into scope creep, and I was tasked (without an internal staff, simply overseeing an outsourced crew) with multiple major projects that were clearly put on hold for years while they looked for someone in this position. It was difficult work, without anyone to really bounce ideas off of or others in the office that understood the logistics and complications of these updates - but over the first nine months or so I had finished all of the initial projects on the roadmap I laid out with senior management when I arrived. So in January I had a meeting with the directors and was told to expect both a raise and a permanent hybrid work environment going forward. I was told to expect about $80k/year.\\n\\n3 weeks later, 'plans had changed' and not only would remote work be pulled off the table, but due to 'budget constraints' my salary would need to remain as-is until at least August. No COLA, no inflation adjustment... nothing.\\n\\nI took a week off right after that and started putting my resume back out there. In March, I began a month-long interview process that has resulted in...\\n\\n**May 2022: IT Operations Lead, Multinational Corporation, $120,000/year.** I let my (former) boss know about the position and told them that if they could find $95k/year in the budget, I'd stay because I believed in the mission.\\n\\nThey told me to turn in my equipment at the end of the day.\\n\\nThe new position is a combination of working with the on-site technology as well as spinning up new projects at their job sites, and while it's yet another sea change from my previous positions, I feel like I'm getting my feet under me and continue to learn and grow. We've also been able to pay off $75,000 in debt since April 2020 and are now going to be able to use this new income to quickly save up for a down payment on a forever home for us.\\n\\n**So, what have I learned?**\\n\\n**- Certifications are good, but so are degrees.** If you plan to stay as a tech/engineer your whole career, certifications are by and large all you're going to need and I would never suggest not working on certs and education. However, if you want to move to a management role, get those degrees. They'll get you through the resume screening filters and, at places like WGU, you can often get the certs and the degree in parallel.\\n\\n**- Upskill, upskill, upskill.** Do home labs. Get a Pluralsight trial and watch some courses (or get your work to pay for it.) If you want to get into management, start reading about and looking at PM certs.\\n\\n**- Work at an MSP early in your career.** You're going to learn a ton of environments, a ton of scenarios, you'll get better at your personal/client service skills, and you'll expand your network...\\n\\n**- But get out of MSP work after a year or two.** Outside of some unicorn MSPs, you will not be paid what you're worth most of the time. You'll also want to settle down into a place that has more standardized setups so you can go tall on your knowledge instead of broad.\\n\\n**- Raises will probably come from job hops instead of merit/time raises until you hit your ceiling.** My offered raises have never been more than a few dollars an hour, at most a $5k or $6k bump after a year. My raises from job hopping?\\n\\n\\\\+$16k, +$15k, and now +$55k annually. Unless you're working at a startup that just got a massive angel investment or went public, you aren't getting an 80%+ raise without job hopping. It rarely hurts to update your resume and put your name out there. Someone out there will recognize your worth and pay you accordingly and fairly.\\n\\n**- Avoid lifestyle creep and manage your debt.** When I got the $50k job, we lived like I was still making $34k and worked on debt payoffs, saving, and investing. This has continued with the $65k job and to my newest job. To be fair, we'll be letting a *little* lifestyle creep happen - we're using part of the first check to replace our 15-year-old washer and dryer - but knowing that most of our money is going to what we want instead of sending payments for things we bought years ago has given us a real sense of peace and tranquility in our household. Allow yourself to enjoy your new wage, but make sure you're also setting yourself up to be OK in a situation where you need to change positions (and take a pay cut) or need to live on savings for an extended period of time.\\n\\nFinally, thank you to this subreddit for the others that have told their stories and given advice.

I did it, so can you. \\n\\n**My Background (Skip to college if you want to see my career path)**\\n\\nWhen I was 18 I started community college, and like many others I didn't know what I wanted to do. I took classes here and there and then dropped out to work after 2 semesters. I loved school, but life happened and without family support, it was just not happening financially. I started working full time in a warehouse, and that was it for education at the time. When I started to take it seriously again, I asked a counselor to lay out what classes I needed to get the hell out of there with any AA possible. I had continued to take classes on and off for years. this meant i had 80 credits and needed 4 more GE classes to graduate with an AA is sociology. Welp, that's what I did. I skated by and my 2.51GPA barely made it above the 2.50 GPA needed fro a cal grant (for those of you outside of CA this pays your tuition at any state school)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**College**\\n\\nWhen I was choosing my major, I knew i wanted to do tech. It was my passion and something that always interested me. But i knew i didn't want to do programming or coding. So i immediately ruled out Computer Science. Then I learned about Computer Infromation Systems. But still, it had classes with C+ and Linux. So I looked at the next, less technical program and found Management Information Systems. \\\\[[https://www.csuchico.edu/cob/about/departments/bsis/option-in-mins.shtml](https://www.csuchico.edu/cob/about/departments/bsis/option-in-mins.shtml)\\\\]\\n\\nWhen I read it, I knew that's what i wanted. I'm a people person so i love interacting. I didn't want to be stuck in a room somewhere googling javascript comile errors \\\\[programmers ily but i hate coding\\\\]. When I knew i wanted to be in Management Information Systems, I looked for state schools that had that exact major. I wanted it written on the degree. I didnt want a Business admin: MINS. I wanted it to say MINS. And thats how i landed at Chico State, Arguably the biggest party school on the westcoast.\\n\\nI didnt know it at the time, but at 26, I was about to embark on the best and worst part of my life. Because the cal grant was capped at 4 semesters, I had to complete 22 upper division courses in 2 years. At the University Level. This included:\\n\\n* Database Modeling (Both SMSS and MySQL)\\n* Database Administration\\n* SAP Linux Administration (what's sudo?)\\n* SAP Business Simultaion\\n* SAP/4Hana Troubleshooting and Documentation\\n* Mobile application development (ios)\\n* Java (Curse you netbeans)\\n* Agile and Waterfall development (SCRUM anyone?)\\n* Cisco Networking (I swear if someone ever comes near me with packet tracers or asks me about VLANS or subnets I'm throwing moist gummy bears at them)\\n\\nI didn't know it at the time, but this coursework, the toughest I ever had to learn would become the cornerstone for my career. Chico State is often seen as a last choice school, but this program prepared me better than many of my peers at more prestigious UC's and state schools. It is an SAP Center meaning they have a direct path after graduation to become SAP certified at a discounted rate. This relationship with SAP means Chevron, Salesforce, Workday recruit heavily in the MINS and CIS departments. My class had 30 graduating students. We were a tiny niche of a program if you will. \\n\\n**Graduation**\\n\\nAfter graduation I landed a kushy 75,000 job.... \\\\*record scratch\\\\* yeah, no. I don't know who those people are but it didn't work out for me that way. When i graduated and moved back to Los Angeles in 2018, I knew i wanted to be some type of analyst. But i didn't really know what kind, and it didn't help that every company uses the word analyst to mean something different. At one point i remember stumbling upon a Dave & Busters job posting for a 'Fun Analyst'. I was not amused. Around month 6 of my job search when I started to get desperate, I started expanding my search to these roles:\\n\\n* Information Systems Analyst\\n* Business Analyst\\n* SQL Analyst\\n* ERP Analyst\\n* Business Systems Analyst\\n* IT Analyst\\n* Database Analyst\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**1st Role**\\n\\n**Information Systems Coordinator**\\n\\n$22/hr + 6 days vacation + 5 sick days \\n\\nI finally got a call for information systems coordinator, and I landed an offer. To my dismay and horror they wanted to hire at $17-$20 an hour, American dollars, in Los Angeles. I told them $20-$25 is more my range. I ended up taking $22/hr, because at this point I was desperate and wanted to start working. While I knew i was taking a lowball I had 0 experience so I saw it as an exchange. I would get experience at a small company, and they would get me for the cheap. I was the only person in my department, and they misrepresented the position. They told me I would be involved with infrastructure projects. What it really was, was Help desk Tier 1,2,3 + Sysadmin + ERP Admin + Database Admin + SQL Report Writer +  Remote Support (IN SPANISH) + License Auditing + Hardware auditing. Basically not what i had signed up for. But an insane amount of experience. On top of this i met my first GateKeeper. An older IT consultant that was friend with the CEO. He had no business getting paid as much as he did and he never (in my full time there) cared to share any infromation on how anything worked. My skills and talent were a threat to his job security. So any project I had, he would immediately try to shut it down or run circles around it to spin it as negatively as possible. One highlight was me pitching an idea to him, we entered a meeting and he pitched it as if he had thought of it himself. He explained an idea to me that I came up with. After that our relationship deteriorated and I went around him to get things done. He was our consultant, but because of his personal relationship to the CEO, his weights held more gravity. All of these issues combined with the low pay pushed me to start job searching within 8 months of this job. Then COVID happened. My Project highlights at this company include:\\n\\n* Deployment of labor tracking software including documentation and user training\\n* Creating a physical VPN tunnel to Mexico (to on prem servers)\\n* Slack deployment (pre covid props to me)\\n* Visitor Management software system\\n* Several Custom SQL Reports (yeah i can write. So a SQL statement walks into a bar and looks at two tables and says, 'hey, may i join you?')\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**2nd Role**\\n\\nWhen I interviewed with my current Position. I killed the interview. It was a bilingual position for Business Analyst. They required 4 years of experience on the job post but i decided to go for it. They wanted someone who had:\\n\\n* Manufacturing/Production experience (remember that 5 year warehouse hiatus?)\\n* Experience with an ERP - SAP Preferred (check)\\n* Understanding of databases (check)\\n* Windows Administration (I was help desk in two separate countries at the same time lol)\\n* Willing to travel (no kids, Im packing my bags right now)\\n\\nNeedless to say at the end of the interview, but I always ask 'Whats stopping you from hiring me right now?' Their response: \\\"um, well... this is going to sound weird... but honestly you're everything we want. You have experience supporting users, negotiating with vendors, SAP, the sales process, you even worked in a warehouse so you've seen the process from the inside'. I knew at that moment I was getting an offer. Their first offer was 70k, I politely declined. I held my guns and said, give me $75k and we can work together. and here I am. Business Systems Analyst. This position entails I route tickets to the support team that needs to see them, I administer 5 different applications/systems, and I am *finally* focused on infrastructure projects. I will be doing 6 ERP migrations to SAP, as well as multiple networking projects at every plant (Im responsbile for 2 locally, but the projects entail 6 nationwide plants). I work with a team of about 12 people, and we have the full support of an IT help desk to handle small day to day issues (hey my printer wont work!!!).

I had the foresight to save money while i was working full time and bought my car outright. I own my 2015 optima. Having a room mate helps a lot with expenses, and I\\u2019m fortunate enough to have learned how to invest and be good at it. It\\u2019s been a side source of income since I graduated from college (I started out with $50/week and currently at 20k /240% return... invested in tech of course) but that a story for another post. Additionally the WFH helps immensely with expenses. \\n\\nI have 2 raises a year written into my current contract, and I believe my bonus is $4k/year starting at completion of my first year.

Thought I\\u2019d share some wisdom from my journey and help others avoid wasted time, wasted money and spare a few others the discouragement so common when starting out \\n\\n1) Be extremely wary of expensive instructors and boot camps. There are no shortcuts. There are so many trainers out there who have never worked in IT, selling courses promising six figures in 6 months. They are predators. Stay away. They will take your money and offer little support. Network and interact with people who do the job you want. The amount of money required to pass these exams and learn these skills is very little. Udemy is really *almost all you need. \\n\\n2) What you want to look out for when starting to study for a certification or going down a certification path are the fundamental concepts that will shorten your learning curve. What do I mean by that? What I mean is that there are certain skill sets that are ubiquitous across almost every aspect of IT. For example: networking, Linux, automation/scripting, cloud. If you build solid knowledge in these core areas, you can branch off easily into any branch of IT. CompTia may not like me saying this but, I do not think that the A+ is a good certification unless you\\u2019re young and a teenager looking for their first part-time tech job at Best Buy. You\\u2019re much better served to jump right into the network+ and Linux+ certifications. Those two right there will get you your first job. If you really feel like you want to do the A+, just take an online course but skip taking the exams it\\u2019s expensive and most of the things you learn on that are not going to provide you with the depth of knowledge that you need to do well in an actual job.\\n\\n3) Cyber security is regarded as the sexiest job in IT, but just know there is no such thing as an entry-level cyber security role regardless of what all the LinkedIn influencers tell you (they\\u2019re probably making money off people like you). There are some rare exceptions but they usually require a degree and end with defense contractors. Private sector has even fewer opportunities for this kind of career leap. Cyber security is a very complex multifaceted career that requires a large amount of experience managing, architecting, maintaining critical enterprise infrastructure. Nobody in their right mind is going to hire somebody who doesn\\u2019t have experience touching that enterprise infrastructure. Security is a great career path but you need to give yourself time to learn the necessary skills to get there. And you can make plenty of money and do just as well before you get to that point. So don\\u2019t sell yourself short by trying to skip steps just because you wanna play Mr. robot. Focus on getting those fundamentals down and getting into a job where you can build out projects that correspond to security objectives. If you can do that, you will absolutely land a security job. \\n\\n4) In your early studies and early certifications, you do not need to build out extensive PHYSICAL labs but you should include plenty of virtual labs and hands on exercises. Your job right now is to learn the theory of IT fundamentals so you can get that first job. Chances are any physical labs you build will be insufficient as a reference point to the infrastructure you will manage on the job. That infrastructure costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. You just can\\u2019t build something like that at home. You can practice things in the cloud or using virtual box, and that makes sense a lot of the time but as far as on premise infrastructure goes with switches and expensive servers, skip that. Focus on passing those initial exams of network+ and Linux+ then learn python or go and code a few projects. Once you get one or two years of experience under your belt, you will have a really good idea of the skills that you need to develop to take the next step in your career. That\\u2019s when it makes the most sense to start to invest in a physical home lab. What you should be doing is practical hands-on exercises. There are so many platforms out there that will walk you through setting up cheap virtualized instances of the infrastructure that you\\u2019re going to be learning. Places like a cloud guru or kodecloud. \\n\\n5) When you land that first IT job, identify the most competent person on your team and emulate that person. Be their friend. Watch how they perform their job duties: what is their process, how do they go through an investigation, how do they take notes or how do they track complex issues? But a big caveat in the following point\\u2026 \\n\\n6) IT is filled with know it all jerks. Be the nice guy/girl. Be kind and genuinely interested in others. Besides the moral value of being a good person, your success will be largely predicated on your ability to connect with others (yes, even the jerks) and express complex ideas while driving solutions with people who are having an emotional response to a stressful situation. Being a jerk or arrogant destroys your ability to do those things\\u2014people won\\u2019t listen to you. However, building political capital and rapport will serve you just as much as your technical expertise. \\n\\nWho am I? I\\u2019m a cloud engineer who started in support and worked my way up to where I am now. I code all day, manage multi-million dollar infra and build out observability tooling in addition to my other responsibilities. I touch containers, serverless/cloud native, security, virtualization, some networking, IaaS, and mostly work in AWS. I have worked in storage and security. \\n\\nA bit long but I hope it\\u2019s helpful. \\n\\nFeel free to ask any questions. :)\\n\\n***may edit periodically for typos or other mistakes.

Share what you want to learn. Share the errors you are dealing with. Share your study resources and why they are useful. Share your preparation journey. Share your questions and your opinions.

Jeremy Cioara shared this advice, I do not know him, but I will be thankful for the rest of my life because this thing worked for me without even noticing what I was accomplishing. \\n\\nNowadays, when people have a question here, on Reddit, I try to bring something to the table. When I learn something, I create a post on Linkedin right away. Of course, my life is not turning around social media. I keep a balance. However, you guys lose nothing trying to follow this advice.

I knew a bit about computers, at the time I was a pretty big MMO player, and knew my way around hacking together bits to make my PC work to play games. I see these posts all the time, and thought I would share my experience. This is a semi-throwaway account. \\n\\n**Pre-IT 2013 - 2017:**  \\nI worked retail. Big box store, for the Americans here, think Red and Khaki. This was my biggest learning experience, though I actually didn't know that at the time. I took this job to have a job. I ended up working there longer than I thought I would. I bounced around different departments of the store, started as a cashier, moved onto the grocery department, electronics department, and then customer service associate. The biggest thing this job taught me, was soft skills, and how to defuse tense situations. At this point, I had worked there for nearly 4 years, and I ran into an acquaintance at the store, who exclaimed, \\\"Wow, you still work here?\\\" Which had me feeling pretty low, and over the four years I'd worked my way up from $7.25 to about $9.50 an hour. \\n\\nI didn't know where to go or what to do. I didn't know what my life looked like. I really lived in the moment. So, in an unwise moment I quit my job on the spot and spent the next few weeks looking for jobs. \\n\\nI focused and changed my mentality. I spent my now free days behind my taped together laptop searching Indeed, applying for jobs. I applied for Government jobs as a permitting associate, a parks and recreation technician, and just about anything. I spent about 40 hours a week applying for jobs just to see what would stick. \\n\\nI spoke with a friend of mine, and he recommended getting my CompTIA A+ certification and learning how to fix computers. So, in after applying for jobs all day I began to study for my A+ by using Professor Messer as my main resource. \\n\\nI had applied and interviewed for a PC Repair technician at a local screwdriver shop, but was turned away due to my lack of experience. I had applied for a job as Help Desk technician at a school. About 10 minutes after applying, I got a phone call for an interview request. I was super nervous, but researched the interview, and asked my friend for relative interview questions. \\n\\nDuring the interview I remained very humble, honest, and transparent. I let them know that I didn't have a degree, or any relevant IT certifications, and much to my amazement after about an hour in the interview, and a call the next day I got the job. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**IT Career Job 1, School Helpdesk Tech $35k per year:**   \\n*Good resource:* /r/k12sysadmin*/*   \\n*2017-2019*\\n\\nThis job was like drinking from a firehose. My role was to be a part-time tech for two different schools. I learned about the helpdesk, windows operating systems, print servers, networking, Microsoft Azure, and MS INtune. I took the opportunity to volunteer myself for any available project, would work tickets with blazing efficacy. I eventually got a raise and a full time move to one of my schools, where I shared and office with a Project Manager for the district at large. He was initially present during my interview. Him and I became friends, and when I asked why he had hired me, he said it was for my soft skills, humbleness, and that I was extremely teachable. In his words, which echo in my head still to this day, \\\"I can teach you how to computer, but I can't teach you how to people.\\\"\\n\\n**What I learned from this job:**  \\nLight technical skills, repairing laptops, projectors, smart boards, printers.  \\nBasics of working a helpdesk, tickets, customer service, delegating tasks to the correct people.  \\nProject Management: learning what it means to be on a project team, defining and identifying stakeholders.\\n\\n**IT Career Job 2: MSP Technician: $48k per year.**   \\n*Good resource:* /r/msp*/*   \\n*2019-2020*\\n\\nIn 2019 I was looking for a bit more lucrative opportunity, and got in touch with a recruiter that got me a job at an MSP. This was a double-edged sword, because MSPs, or Managed Service providers are notorious for overworking their staff. This was true, but I also learned so much. I learned so much about Microsoft 365, Windows Server, VMWare, Hyper-V, networking and so much more. But after a while the deliverables became too unrealistic. 24/7 on-call, 55+ hour work weeks, and professional development. With burnout being real, I got laid off because of a \\\"Reduction in force\\\" due to covid. \\n\\n**What I learned from this job:**  \\nSoft Skills: Really being able to understand and defuse a situation, providing great customer service, and keeping somebody engage/distracted while solving an issue.  \\nTechnical skills: Systems Administration, and Network administration. Really being able to solve things, perform root cause analysis, etc. \\n\\n**IT Career Job 3: Corporate IT Support Lead: $75k**  \\n*Good resource:* /r/sysadmin  \\n*2020 - 2023*\\n\\nThis really was a different world that I was used to. The IT Department at this company was larger than most of the companies I worked for previously. The job officially was managing tickets and being an escalation point, but it was more about business analysis, and continuous improvement. I became the lead technical contact for the visual marketing department, and I was able to make the job I wanted out of it.   \\n\\n\\n**What I learned from this job:**  \\nBusiness Analysis: Observing parts of a business that could use technological improvements, identifying stakeholders and opportunities.   \\nCorporate Politics: Understanding who the players are in specific departments, how to get things done while going through red tape and making a name for yourself and maintaining a reputation. \\n\\n**IT Career Job 4 Business Systems Analyst: $100k**  \\n*Good Resource:* /r/sysadmin  \\n*2023 - Present.*  \\n\\n\\nEarlier this year, my girlfriend and I moved states, and I was able to take this opportunity. It is the culmination of all of the work I've put in over the years and is really everything I want out of a role. It's focusing on project management, systems building an architecture, and relationship building. \\n\\n**Closing points:**\\n\\nMy biggest takeaway, and biggest piece of advice for anyone who wants to start a career in IT is to start at the helpdesk. Learn the basics, learn how to interact with others. People come to you in a moment of need and you can ease their concerns. You read a lot of things about \\\"How to make 12 figures with no degree in cybersecurity.\\\" Though, if you don't know the basics, you won't get there. It doesn't happen overnight. \\n\\nLearn how to play well with others, learn everything you can. Most importantly? Leave your ego at the door. Don't be the smartest person in the room, learn something from every situation, and don't be afraid to admit that you're wrong.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\"", "title": "$9 an hour to $100k over 6 years without a degree.", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/163tzso/9_an_hour_to_100k_over_6_years_without_a_degree/"}, {"author": "CavaHS", "created_utc": 1683509052.0, "link_flair_template_id": null, "link_flair_text": null, "num_comments": 158, "post_id": "13b9hmb", "score": 596, "subreddit": "ITCareerQuestions", "text": "\"I quit my 1st IT job after 1 year and then used chatGPT to help me rewrite my resume and cover letter.

I don\\u2019t post on here much but whenever I mention in comments that I went from 42k a year to six figures in less than 3 years usually a few people message me wanting to find out what I did and if I had any advice. I made a few poor career decisions during this time and some good ones, for this reason I thought this post might help some people.\\n\\n**Job History Timeline:**\\n\\nMay 2019: Graduated college with a B.S in Information Technology. I had an IT internship during my last semester which I don\\u2019t count as experience anymore, but it helped me land my first real IT position post-graduation. \\n\\nMay 2019 - September 2019 (Service Desk Analyst, contract to hire, $23/h): Worked as a service desk analyst for a large hospital chain as a contract to hire. The contracting company was TekSystems. The position was absolutely awful, it was basically a glorified call center job where all I would do is reset passwords and install the same 3 software everyday. The floor manager would publicly humiliate you if you made a mistake, he would yell at people and shit talk them in front of everyone else. There was no room for growth and eventually I got so sick of it I called my recruiter and told him I\\u2019m about to quit this position without having anything lined up. He talked me out of doing that and ended up finding me my next position.\\n\\nSeptember 2019 - September 2019 (Windows Migration Technician, contract, $23/h): The same TekSystems recruiter found me a position at a military equipment manufacturer as a Windows Migration Technician. Basically I was just there to help them migrate their laptop and desktops from Windows 7 to 10. Unfortunately after 4 days I was fired from this position for \\u201cAsking too many questions\\u201d. I later found out that this company hired 10 contractors and after 4 days fired 5 of them on the same day. The recruiter told me he didn\\u2019t have anything else lined up, so I was fucked in that regards.\\n\\nOctober 2019 - December 2019 (Windows Migration Technician, contract, $25/h): About a week after I got fired a recruiter from Apex Systems contacted me about an opening for the exact same type of contact that I was just fired from, only at a different company. This time it was a telecommunications company. I didn\\u2019t tell the recruiter that I was just fired from the same position, and I got the contract. The work was pretty chaotic, the inhouse IT staff\\u2019s asset management software was completely disorganized, they did know how many devices were Windows 7 or Windows 10, we literally had walk to every cubicle and ask the user what their operating system was. Nobody was keeping track of what the contractors were doing, one of the other contractors who was hired with me would show up to work in the morning, pretend to work for about a hour, then would disappear for the whole day only to come back at the last hour of the work day and pretend to work. I found out on the last day of the contact that he was working as an Uber driver simultaneously while \\u201cworking\\u201d at this contact. The inhouse IT staff never found out about this, they thought the reason they never saw him was because he was somewhere else in the office working. I could go on and on about how mismanaged this project was, but overall I liked my boss and coworkers, so I didn\\u2019t hate the position. The contact ended Dec 31st and I was unemployed again.\\n\\nFebruary 2020 - May 2020 (Windows Migration Technician, contract, $20/h): I moved to a new state and found another contact position doing Windows migrations. At this point I absolutely did not want to do another short term contact, but I had no choice because it was either that or being unemployed. This contact was actually well managed compared to the previous one, everything was organized and we got a lot of stuff done. I knew this contract would end eventually so I decided to start actually applying to full time positions instead of waiting for my contract to end. \\n\\nMay 2020 - September 2020 (IT Consultant at MSP, permanent, 50k/y): The way I got this job was actually pretty unusual. I previously interviewed for this position before I started working at my last Window Migration job, the MSP owner chose to go with another candidate, but I later found out that he fired that guy for some unknown reason. While I was working at my last position the recruiter who set up this initial interview called me to ask if I was still looking for a job, she then told me I should contact the owner of the MSP because he doesn\\u2019t work with this recruitment company anymore. So the next day I found the owner\\u2019s LinkedIn page and sent him a message basically asking if he had any positions available. He wasn\\u2019t planning on hiring anybody else but for some reason he decided on the spot that he wanted to create a position for me, two weeks later I was working for him. The position was essentially desktop support for an MSP, I worked from home and would travel to client\\u2019s offices. Unfortunately I was laid off from this job due to Covid-19, the MSP lost a few of their big clients who went bankrupt, my position had to be eliminated because there was very little work to assign me. The MSP owner apologized to me, said it was his fault not mine that I am being let go, and he left me a recommendation on my LinkedIn page.\\n\\nOctober 2020 - January 2022(Help Desk Technician, permanent, 42k/y: A few weeks after my lay off I was offered a position as an IT Tech/help desk at an engineering company. The company was paying me less than what I was making at my previous position, but I was unemployed so I took it. The position was alright for a help desk job, I like my boss and coworkers. We were understaffed and that made the workload pretty bad, but it kept me busy and they let me work from home 4 days a week, which was pretty cool. This position was also cool because they invested in career development for their staff and let me get basic hands-on experience with Windows Server, Azure, Nutanix, Proofpoint, etc. This helped me a lot in getting my next and current position. After I got one full year of experience at this place I got really burnt out and knew I really wanted to get out of entry level support, so I started applying to cybersecurity positions.\\n\\nFebruary 2022 - Present (Technical Account Manager - Security, permanent, 105k/y): After months of applying, 30+ interviews, lots and lots of rejections, I finally got offered my current position. The company is actually paying me more than what I asked for. I asked for like 80k during my initial screening with HR, after I got offered the position the recruiter told me that 80k was to low for this position and they don\\u2019t want me to go looking for a new job when I discover I\\u2019m being paid less than what I potentially could make elsewhere, so they increased it to more than 100k. So far I am loving the job, it's fully remote and I genuinely enjoy what I do. I don\\u2019t dread going into work like I did at all my previous jobs. \\n\\n\\n\\n**Key things that got me the cyber security job:**\\n\\n-While I was a helpdesk tech I tried to get involved in anything related to cybersecurity so I could put it on my resume. Our security guy sent us a message asking if anybody wanted to help him run our phishing/user training platform knowbe4, I immediately volunteered. After that, I built a relationship with our security engineer and he would give me simple tasks to do that he didn't feel like doing or didn't have time to do. I would then put that experience on my resume. A lot of the experience I built during this time was because I asked for it, nobody intended to give me access to Azure, after I bugged the sysadmin for long enough he finally let in and did it.\\n \\n-The company that I work for currently is a vendor that sells a cyber security product. By coincidence the help desk position I had was with a company that used this product and gave me admin access to it. Because of this I became semi familiar with the product and was able to leverage that when interviewing for this company.\\n \\n-Studied as much as possible about security. Everytime I went to an interview and they would give me technical questions, I would write down the questions I didn\\u2019t know and look up the answer later. I noticed that a lot of interviewers were asking the same questions, it was almost like they all googled \\u201cbest entry level infosec questions to ask on an interview\\u201d and were reading off this list. After a while I became very comfortable answering questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**Mistakes I made/things I learned:**\\n\\n-Avoid short term contracts at all costs unless you are desperate. Having a bunch of short contracts on my resume sucked, employers don\\u2019t like to see a resume with 3 years of experience with 5 different companies. I make it as clear as possible on my resume that these were short term temp contacts, but most don\\u2019t care. I don\\u2019t even list my contacts on my resume anymore, if anyone asks why there is 7 month gap from the time I graduated college to the first position I list on my resume, I just tell them i went backpacking after college, its better than seeing all my shitty contracts. Plus temp contracting sucks in general, you do basic tedious work, you have to be looking for a new job all the time, you gain little actual practical experience, the in house IT staff don\\u2019t treat you like a fellow employee because they know you are going to leave soon. Just don\\u2019t do it.\\n\\n-When interviewing for your first help desk job, make sure to ask what kind of technology you will be exposed to and have access to. Not all help desk jobs are equal, some of them won\\u2019t let you do anything except change passwords and install adobe. Others will give you access to a wide variety of technology which you can then put on your resume. This is essentially how I was able to transition to cybersecurity, by leveraging the experience I built during help desk. \\n\\n-Entry level certifications are virtually valueless to 95% of hiring managers. I have a Comptia A+, Security+, and a AWS SA cert. Not a single time did anyone mention that on my resume or cared if I brought it up. In the case of the AWS cert, unless you have direct experience working with AWS in a production environment, nobody cares that you passed an exam. Certs are meant to prove existing knowledge you got on the job, not get you a job if you don\\u2019t have experience with that cert subject.\\n\\n-Don\\u2019t post your updated resume on a job board if you are currently employed. I did this during my last help desk position and apparently the company\\u2019s HR found out about it and notified my boss. I had to have an awkward conversation with him and basically lie to him that I\\u2019m not looking for a new position. For the next few months I thought I was going to get fired any day because my boss thinks I\\u2019m about to leave the company.\\n\\n**EDIT:** A lot of people seemed to be irritated when I said that entry-level certs are mostly valueless. Let me reexplain what I am trying to say. I am not saying that getting certs are valueless completely, what I am saying is that entry level certs do not substitute actual experience and people on this sub over value certs as a means to get their preferred position. This is mostly a response to the 1000s of posts on this sub that are like \\\"What cert will qualify me to become a sysadmin\\\" or \\\"Will an AWS cert get me a cloud position?\\\". From my own experience, if you have a cert but don't have actual work experience to go along with that cert, it is essentially valueless (the one exception to this is government security jobs, which do actually require a Sec+ or similar certification). Very few people will care that you have an AWS cert if you never actually worked with AWS in a production environment. Especially for entry level certs, anybody can cram for a test and pass it. I passed my CompTIA Sec+ exam after only 10 days of studying for it, and I am not smart by any means. This is why hirer end certs like CISSP, CISA, PMP, all require you to have years of documented and verifiable related work experience before you are even allowed to take the exam. Even on entry level certifications like the CompTIA A+, on the documentation it says that although there are no required pre-requisites for taking the exam, they recommend you have a year of work experience before you take it.\\n\\nThe point being, certs are meant to compliment existing work experience, not substitute for it. During my career I never once felt that a cert that I got helped me land a position, not a single time did a hiring manager ask me about the cert or even comment on its existence. It's as if it wasn't even on my resume. Actual related work experience was all that mattered, the bachelors degree helped get pass HR, but really all hiring managers cared about was how my previous help desk experience translated into the position I was applying for. I am not anti-cert by any means, in fact later this year I will be attempting the CEH exam, not because I want to but because having this cert is required in my master's degree program.\"", "title": "Went from a $42k a year help desk job to a $105k a year cybersecurity job in 2.5 years.

Sure, if you are a pen tester you will be hands on with exploits and actively \\\"hacking\\\" an environment but what isn't talked about is that you will be in documentation hell for a huge portion of the day.

Curious, I began going through posts of people asking how they could break into IT, and I began to question my own career. Throughout my twenties (I'm 28 now) I've worked as a sound engineer, policy researcher, chef, personal trainer, charity worker and most recently in administration at a government building. To tell you the truth, I was completely lost. Unsure what the hell I wanted to be, or what my life would look like as I got closer and closer to my 30s. \\n\\nFrom the wealth of information people have contributed on this site, I found out about networking, servers, about comptia a+ n+ s+, about the range of different IT careers out there and the way to get into them. With advice from this forum I threw myself into learning IT after work. I downloaded virtual box, setup servers 2012/2016, taught myself some Active Directory, Powershell, I even bought a few cheap cisco routers and switches and began studying for my CCNA. \\n\\nAll of this went on as I began applying ruthlessly for any entry level IT job I could find. I sent off hundreds, and due to my lack of experience the vast majority were rejected. \\n\\nHowever, I'd just like to tell you all that today I've been offered a position as an IT support administrator for a renewable energy company in London. In my 2 interviews with them, I was completely open that I was inexperienced but passionate about learning new technologies. And they gave it to me! They even said after a year they would pay for my training/certs in Networking/security. \\n\\nSeriously, thanks to all of you who contribute on this sub, and even those of you who are asking basic questions. It's all been invaluable to me getting my first IT job. As a bit of background, I've always liked computers but never been the most tech-savvy person, and for years thought IT/computer jobs were solely for whizz-kids who have been doing this stuff since they were toddlers. But it's not true. Apply yourself to learning new technologies and demonstrate it to potential employers and you'll get somewhere. \\n\\nThanks to all of you and good luck to those who are simply browsing this sub.\\n\\nEdit: obligatory thanks for the gold kind stranger!
